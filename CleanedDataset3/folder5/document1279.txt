POEMS AND SONGS OF ROBERT BURNS




Preface

Robert Burns was born near Ayr Scotland 25th of January 1759 He was
the son of William Burnes or Burness at the time of the poets birth a
nurseryman on the banks of the Doon in Ayrshire His father though
always extremely poor attempted to give his children a fair education
and Robert who was the eldest went to school for three years in a
neighboring village and later for shorter periods to three other
schools in the vicinity But it was to his father and to his own reading
that he owed the more important part of his education and by the time
that he had reached manhood he had a good knowledge of English a
reading knowledge of French and a fairly wide acquaintance with the
masterpieces of English literature from the time of Shakespeare to his
own day In 1766 William Burness rented on borrowed money the farm of
Mount Oliphant and in taking his share in the effort to make this
undertaking succeed the future poet seems to have seriously
overstrained his physique In 1771 the family move to Lochlea and Burns
went to the neighboring town of Irvine to learn flaxdressing The only
result of this experiment however was the formation of an acquaintance
with a dissipated sailor whom he afterward blamed as the prompter of
his first licentious adventures His father died in 1784 and with his
brother Gilbert the poet rented the farm of Mossgiel but this venture
was as unsuccessful as the others He had meantime formed an irregular
intimacy with Jean Armour for which he was censured by the
Kirksession As a result of his farming misfortunes and the attempts
of his fatherinlaw to overthrow his irregular marriage with Jean he
resolved to emigrate and in order to raise money for the passage he
published Kilmarnock 1786 a volume of the poems which he had been
composing from time to time for some years This volume was unexpectedly
successful so that instead of sailing for the West Indies he went up
to Edinburgh and during that winter he was the chief literary celebrity
of the season An enlarged edition of his poems was published there in
1787 and the money derived from this enabled him to aid his brother in
Mossgiel and to take and stock for himself the farm of Ellisland in
Dumfriesshire His fame as poet had reconciled the Armours to the
connection and having now regularly married Jean he brought her to
Ellisland and once more tried farming for three years Continued
illsuccess however led him in 1791 to abandon Ellisland and he moved
to Dumfries where he had obtained a position in the Excise But he was
now thoroughly discouraged his work was mere drudgery his tendency to
take his relaxation in debauchery increased the weakness of a
constitution early undermined and he died at Dumfries in his
thirtyeighth year

See Burns Birthplace The living room in the Burns birthplace
cottage

It is not necessary here to attempt to disentangle or explain away the
numerous amours in which he was engaged through the greater part of his
life It is evident that Burns was a man of extremely passionate nature
and fond of conviviality and the misfortunes of his lot combined with
his natural tendencies to drive him to frequent excesses of
selfindulgence He was often remorseful and he strove painfully if
intermittently after better things But the story of his life must be
admitted to be in its externals a painful and somewhat sordid chronicle
That it contained however many moments of joy and exaltation is proved
by the poems here printed

Burns poetry falls into two main groups English and Scottish His
English poems are for the most part inferior specimens of conventional
eighteenthcentury verse But in Scottish poetry he achieved triumphs of
a quite extraordinary kind Since the time of the Reformation and the
union of the crowns of England and Scotland the Scots dialect had
largely fallen into disuse as a medium for dignified writing Shortly
before Burns time however Allan Ramsay and Robert Fergusson had been
the leading figures in a revival of the vernacular and Burns received
from them a national tradition which he succeeded in carrying to its
highest pitch becoming thereby to an almost unique degree the poet of
his people

He first showed complete mastery of verse in the field of satire In
The Twa Herds Holy Willies Prayer Address to the Unco Guid
The Holy Fair and others he manifested sympathy with the protest of
the socalled New Light party which had sprung up in opposition to
the extreme Calvinism and intolerance of the dominant Auld Lichts The
fact that Burns had personally suffered from the discipline of the Kirk
probably added fire to his attacks but the satires show more than
personal animus The force of the invective the keenness of the wit
and the fervor of the imagination which they displayed rendered them an
important force in the theological liberation of Scotland

The Kilmarnock volume contained besides satire a number of poems like
The Twa Dogs and The Cotters Saturday Night which are vividly
descriptive of the Scots peasant life with which he was most familiar
and a group like Puir Mailie and To a Mouse which in the
tenderness of their treatment of animals revealed one of the most
attractive sides of Burns personality Many of his poems were never
printed during his lifetime the most remarkable of these being The
Jolly Beggars a piece in which by the intensity of his imaginative
sympathy and the brilliance of his technique he renders a picture of
the lowest dregs of society in such a way as to raise it into the realm
of great poetry

But the real national importance of Burns is due chiefly to his songs
The Puritan austerity of the centuries following the Reformation had
discouraged secular music like other forms of art in Scotland and as
a result Scottish song had become hopelessly degraded in point both of
decency and literary quality From youth Burns had been interested in
collecting the fragments he had heard sung or found printed and he came
to regard the rescuing of this almost lost national inheritance in the
light of a vocation About his songmaking two points are especially
noteworthy first that the greater number of his lyrics sprang from
actual emotional experiences second that almost all were composed to
old melodies While in Edinburgh he undertook to supply material for
Johnsons Musical Museum and as few of the traditional songs could
appear in a respectable collection Burns found it necessary to make
them over Sometimes he kept a stanza or two sometimes only a line or
chorus sometimes merely the name of the air the rest was his own His
method as he has told us himself was to become familiar with the
traditional melody to catch a suggestion from some fragment of the old
song to fix upon an idea or situation for the new poem then humming
or whistling the tune as he went about his work he wrought out the new
verses going into the house to write them down when the inspiration
began to flag In this process is to be found the explanation of much of
the peculiar quality of the songs of Burns Scarcely any known author
has succeeded so brilliantly in combining his work with folk material
or in carrying on with such continuity of spirit the tradition of
popular song For George Thomsons collection of Scottish airs he
performed a function similar to that which he had had in the Museum
and his poetical activity during the last eight or nine years of his
life was chiefly devoted to these two publications In spite of the fact
that he was constantly in severe financial straits he refused to accept
any recompense for this work preferring to regard it as a patriotic
service And it was indeed a patriotic service of no small magnitude
By birth and temperament he was singularly fitted for the task and this
fitness is proved by the unique extent to which his productions were
accepted by his countrymen and have passed into the life and feeling of
his race

SongHandsome Nell1

 TuneI am a man unmarried


 Footnote 1 The first of my performancesR B

 Once I lovd a bonie lass
 Ay and I love her still
 And whilst that virtue warms my breast
 Ill love my handsome Nell

 As bonie lasses I hae seen
 And mony full as braw
 But for a modest gracefu mein
 The like I never saw

 A bonie lass I will confess
 Is pleasant to the ee
 But without some better qualities
 Shes no a lass for me

 But Nellys looks are blythe and sweet
 And what is best of a
 Her reputation is complete
 And fair without a flaw

 She dresses aye sae clean and neat
 Both decent and genteel
 And then theres something in her gait
 Gars ony dress look weel

 A gaudy dress and gentle air
 May slightly touch the heart
 But its innocence and modesty
 That polishes the dart

 Tis this in Nelly pleases me
 Tis this enchants my soul
 For absolutely in my breast
 She reigns without control




SongO Tibbie I Hae Seen The Day

 TuneInvercaulds Reel or Strathspey


 ChoirO Tibbie I hae seen the day
 Ye wadna been sae shy
 For laik o gear ye lightly me
 But trowth I care na by

 Yestreen I met you on the moor
 Ye spak na but gaed by like stour
 Ye geck at me because Im poor
 But fient a hair care I
 O Tibbie I hae seen the day c

 When coming hame on Sunday last
 Upon the road as I cam past
 Ye snufft and gae your head a cast
 But trowth I caret na by
 O Tibbie I hae seen the day c

 I doubt na lass but ye may think
 Because ye hae the name o clink
 That ye can please me at a wink
 Wheneer ye like to try
 O Tibbie I hae seen the day c

 But sorrow tak him thats sae mean
 Altho his pouch o coin were clean
 Wha follows ony saucy quean
 That looks sae proud and high
 O Tibbie I hae seen the day c

 Altho a lad were eer sae smart
 If that he want the yellow dirt
 Yell cast your head anither airt
 And answer him fu dry
 O Tibbie I hae seen the day c

 But if he hae the name o gear
 Yell fasten to him like a brier
 Tho hardly he for sense or lear
 Be better than the kye
 O Tibbie I hae seen the day c

 But Tibbie lass tak my advice
 Your daddies gear maks you sae nice
 The deil a ane wad speir your price
 Were ye as poor as I
 O Tibbie I hae seen the day c

 There lives a lass beside yon park
 Id rather hae her in her sark
 Than you wi a your thousand mark
 That gars you look sae high
 O Tibbie I hae seen the day c




SongI Dreamd I Lay

 I dreamd I lay where flowers were springing
 Gaily in the sunny beam
 Listning to the wild birds singing
 By a falling crystal stream
 Straight the sky grew black and daring
 Thro the woods the whirlwinds rave
 Tress with aged arms were warring
 Oer the swelling drumlie wave

 Such was my lifes deceitful morning
 Such the pleasures I enjoyed
 But lang or noon loud tempests storming
 A my flowery bliss destroyd
 Tho fickle fortune has deceivd me
 She promisd fair and performd but ill
 Of mony a joy and hope bereavd me
 I bear a heart shall support me still




SongIn The Character Of A Ruined Farmer

 TuneGo from my window Love do


 The sun he is sunk in the west
 All creatures retired to rest
 While here I sit all sore beset
 With sorrow grief and woe
 And its O fickle Fortune O

 The prosperous man is asleep
 Nor hears how the whirlwinds sweep
 But Misery and I must watch
 The surly tempest blow
 And its O fickle Fortune O

 There lies the dear partner of my breast
 Her cares for a moment at rest
 Must I see thee my youthful pride
 Thus brought so very low
 And its O fickle Fortune O

 There lie my sweet babies in her arms
 No anxious fear their little hearts alarms
 But for their sake my heart does ache
 With many a bitter throe
 And its O fickle Fortune O

 I once was by Fortune carest
 I once could relieve the distrest
 Now lifes poor support hardly earnd
 My fate will scarce bestow
 And its O fickle Fortune O

 No comfort no comfort I have
 How welcome to me were the grave
 But then my wife and children dear
 O wither would they go
 And its O fickle Fortune O

 O whither O whither shall I turn
 All friendless forsaken forlorn
 For in this world Rest or Peace
 I never more shall know
 And its O fickle Fortune O




Tragic Fragment

 All devil as I ama damned wretch
 A hardened stubborn unrepenting villain
 Still my heart melts at human wretchedness
 And with sincere but unavailing sighs
 I view the helpless children of distress
 With tears indignant I behold the oppressor
 Rejoicing in the honest mans destruction
 Whose unsubmitting heart was all his crime
 Evn you ye hapless crew I pity you
 Ye whom the seeming good think sin to pity
 Ye poor despised abandoned vagabonds
 Whom Vice as usual has turnd oer to ruin
 Oh but for friends and interposing Heaven
 I had been driven forth like you forlorn
 The most detested worthless wretch among you
 O injured God Thy goodness has endowd me
 With talents passing most of my compeers
 Which I in just proportion have abused
 As far surpassing other common villains
 As Thou in natural parts has given me more




Tarbolton Lasses The

 If ye gae up to yon hilltap
 Yell there see bonie Peggy
 She kens her father is a laird
 And she forsooths a leddy

 There Sophy tight a lassie bright
 Besides a handsome fortune
 Wha canna win her in a night
 Has little art in courtin

 Gae down by Faile and taste the ale
 And tak a look o Mysie
 Shes dour and din a deil within
 But aiblins she may please ye

 If she be shy her sister try
 Yell maybe fancy Jenny
 If yell dispense wi want o sense
 She kens hersel shes bonie

 As ye gae up by yon hillside
 Speir in for bonie Bessy
 Shell gie ye a beck and bid ye light
 And handsomely address ye

 Theres few sae bonie nane sae guid
 In a King George dominion
 If ye should doubt the truth o this
 Its Bessys ain opinion

 Ah Woe Is Me My Mother Dear

 Paraphrase of Jeremiah 15th Chap 10th verse

 Ah woe is me my mother dear
 A man of strife yeve born me
 For sair contention I maun bear
 They hate revile and scorn me

 I neer could lend on bill or band
 That five per cent might blest me
 And borrowing on the tither hand
 The deil a ane wad trust me

 Yet I a coindenied wight
 By Fortune quite discarded
 Ye see how I am day and night
 By lad and lass blackguarded




Montgomeries Peggy

 TuneGalla Water


 Altho my bed were in yon muir
 Amang the heather in my plaidie
 Yet happy happy would I be
 Had I my dear Montgomeries Peggy

 When oer the hill beat surly storms
 And winter nights were dark and rainy
 Id seek some dell and in my arms
 Id shelter dear Montgomeries Peggy

 Were I a baron proud and high
 And horse and servants waiting ready
 Then a twad gie o joy to me
 The sharint with Montgomeries Peggy




Ploughmans Life The

 As I was awandring ae morning in spring
 I heard a young ploughman sae sweetly to sing
 And as he was singin thir words he did say
 Theres nae life like the ploughmans in the month o sweet May

 The lavrock in the morning shell rise frae her nest
 And mount i the air wi the dew on her breast
 And wi the merry ploughman shell whistle and sing
 And at night shell return to her nest back again

Ronalds Of The Bennals The

 In Tarbolton ye ken there are proper young men
 And proper young lasses and a man
 But ken ye the Ronalds that live in the Bennals
 They carry the gree frae them a man

 Their fathers laird and weel he can sparet
 Braid money to tocher them a man
 To proper young men hell clink in the hand
 Gowd guineas a hunder or twa man

 Theres ane they ca Jean Ill warrant yeve seen
 As bonie a lass or as braw man
 But for sense and guid taste shell vie wi the best
 And a conduct that beautifies a man

 The charms o the min the langer they shine
 The mair admiration they draw man
 While peaches and cherries and roses and lilies
 They fade and they wither awa man

 If ye be for Miss Jean tak this frae a frien
 A hint o a rival or twa man
 The Laird o Blackbyre wad gang through the fire
 If that wad entice her awa man

 The Laird o Braehead has been on his speed
 For mair than a towmond or twa man
 The Laird o the Ford will straught on a board
 If he canna get her at a man

 Then Anna comes in the pride o her kin
 The boast of our bachelors a man
 Sae sonsy and sweet sae fully complete
 She steals our affections awa man

 If I should detail the pick and the wale
 O lasses that live here awa man
 The faut wad be mine if they didna shine
 The sweetest and best o them a man

 I loe her mysel but darena weel tell
 My poverty keeps me in awe man
 For making o rhymes and working at times
 Does little or naething at a man

 Yet I wadna choose to let her refuse
 Nor haet in her power to say na man
 For though I be poor unnoticed obscure
 My stomachs as proud as them a man

 Though I canna ride in weelbooted pride
 And flee oer the hills like a craw man
 I can haud up my head wi the best o the breed
 Though fluttering ever so braw man

 My coat and my vest they are Scotch o the best
 Opairs o guid breeks I hae twa man
 And stockings and pumps to put on my stumps
 And neer a wrang steek in them a man

 My sarks they are few but five o them new
 Twal hundred as white as the snaw man
 A tenshillings hat a Holland cravat
 There are no mony poets sae braw man

 I never had friens weel stockit in means
 To leave me a hundred or twa man
 Nae weeltocherd aunts to wait on their drants
 And wish them in hell for it a man

 I never was cannie for hoarding o money
 Or claughtint together at a man
 Ive little to spend and naething to lend
 But deevil a shilling I awe man




SongHeres To Thy Health

 TuneLaggan Burn


 Heres to thy health my bonie lass
 Gude nicht and joy be wi thee
 Ill come nae mair to thy bowerdoor
 To tell thee that I loe thee
 O dinna think my pretty pink
 But I can live without thee
 I vow and swear I dinna care
 How lang ye look about ye

 Thourt aye sae free informing me
 Thou hast nae mind to marry
 Ill be as free informing thee
 Nae time hae I to tarry
 I ken thy friens try ilka means
 Frae wedlock to delay thee
 Depending on some higher chance
 But fortune may betray thee

 I ken they scorn my low estate
 But that does never grieve me
 For Im as free as any he
 Sma siller will relieve me
 Ill count my health my greatest wealth
 Sae lang as Ill enjoy it
 Ill fear nae scant Ill bode nae want
 As langs I get employment

 But far off fowls hae feathers fair
 And aye until ye try them
 Tho they seem fair still have a care
 They may prove waur than I am
 But at twal at night when the moon shines bright
 My dear Ill come and see thee
 For the man that loves his mistress weel
 Nae travel makes him weary




Lass Of Cessnock Banks The1

 Footnote 1 The lass is identified as Ellison Begbie a servant
 wench daughter of a Farmer Lang

 A Song of Similes

 TuneIf he be a Butcher neat and trim


 On Cessnock banks a lassie dwells
 Could I describe her shape and mein
 Our lasses a she far excels
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Shes sweeter than the morning dawn
 When rising Phoebus first is seen
 And dewdrops twinkle oer the lawn
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Shes stately like yon youthful ash
 That grows the cowslip braes between
 And drinks the stream with vigour fresh
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Shes spotless like the flowring thorn
 With flowrs so white and leaves so green
 When purest in the dewy morn
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Her looks are like the vernal May
 When evning Phoebus shines serene
 While birds rejoice on every spray
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Her hair is like the curling mist
 That climbs the mountainsides at een
 When flowrreviving rains are past
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Her foreheads like the showry bow
 When gleaming sunbeams intervene
 And gild the distant mountains brow
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Her cheeks are like yon crimson gem
 The pride of all the flowery scene
 Just opening on its thorny stem
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Her bosoms like the nightly snow
 When pale the morning rises keen
 While hid the murmring streamlets flow
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Her lips are like yon cherries ripe
 That sunny walls from Boreas screen
 They tempt the taste and charm the sight
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Her teeth are like a flock of sheep
 With fleeces newly washen clean
 That slowly mount the rising steep
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Her breath is like the fragrant breeze
 That gently stirs the blossomd bean
 When Phoebus sinks behind the seas
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 Her voice is like the evning thrush
 That sings on Cessnock banks unseen
 While his mate sits nestling in the bush
 An she has twa sparkling roguish een

 But its not her air her form her face
 Tho matching beautys fabled queen
 Tis the mind that shines in evry grace
 An chiefly in her roguish een

SongMary Morison

 TuneBide ye yet

 O Mary at thy window be
 It is the wishd the trysted hour
 Those smiles and glances let me see
 That make the misers treasure poor
 How blythely was I bide the stour
 A weary slave frae sun to sun
 Could I the rich reward secure
 The lovely Mary Morison

 Yestreen when to the trembling string
 The dance gaed thro the lighted ha
 To thee my fancy took its wing
 I sat but neither heard nor saw
 Tho this was fair and that was braw
 And yon the toast of a the town
 I sighd and said among them a
 Ye are na Mary Morison

 Oh Mary canst thou wreck his peace
 Wha for thy sake wad gladly die
 Or canst thou break that heart of his
 Whase only faut is loving thee
 If love for love thou wilt na gie
 At least be pity to me shown
 A thought ungentle canna be
 The thought o Mary Morison

Winter A Dirge

 The wintry west extends his blast
 And hail and rain does blaw
 Or the stormy north sends driving forth
 The blinding sleet and snaw
 While tumbling brown the burn comes down
 And roars frae bank to brae
 And bird and beast in covert rest
 And pass the heartless day

 The sweeping blast the sky oercast
 The joyless winter day
 Let others fear to me more dear
 Than all the pride of May
 The tempests howl it soothes my soul
 My griefs it seems to join
 The leafless trees my fancy please
 Their fate resembles mine

 Thou Power Supreme whose mighty scheme
 These woes of mine fulfil
 Here firm I rest they must be best
 Because they are Thy will
 Then all I wantO do Thou grant
 This one request of mine
 Since to enjoy Thou dost deny
 Assist me to resign




Prayer Under The Pressure Of Violent Anguish

 O Thou Great Being what Thou art
 Surpasses me to know
 Yet sure I am that known to Thee
 Are all Thy works below

 Thy creature here before Thee stands
 All wretched and distrest
 Yet sure those ills that wring my soul
 Obey Thy high behest

 Sure Thou Almighty canst not act
 From cruelty or wrath
 O free my weary eyes from tears
 Or close them fast in death

 But if I must afflicted be
 To suit some wise design
 Then man my soul with firm resolves
 To bear and not repine




Paraphrase Of The First Psalm

 The man in life wherever placd
 Hath happiness in store
 Who walks not in the wickeds way
 Nor learns their guilty lore

 Nor from the seat of scornful pride
 Casts forth his eyes abroad
 But with humility and awe
 Still walks before his God

 That man shall flourish like the trees
 Which by the streamlets grow
 The fruitful top is spread on high
 And firm the root below

 But he whose blossom buds in guilt
 Shall to the ground be cast
 And like the rootless stubble tost
 Before the sweeping blast

 For why that God the good adore
 Hath givn them peace and rest
 But hath decreed that wicked men
 Shall neer be truly blest




First Six Verses Of The Ninetieth Psalm Versified The

 O Thou the first the greatest friend
 Of all the human race
 Whose strong right hand has ever been
 Their stay and dwelling place

 Before the mountains heavd their heads
 Beneath Thy forming hand
 Before this ponderous globe itself
 Arose at Thy command

 That Powr which raisd and still upholds
 This universal frame
 From countless unbeginning time
 Was ever still the same

 Those mighty periods of years
 Which seem to us so vast
 Appear no more before Thy sight
 Than yesterday thats past

 Thou givst the word Thy creature man
 Is to existence brought
 Again Thou sayst Ye sons of men
 Return ye into nought

 Thou layest them with all their cares
 In everlasting sleep
 As with a flood Thou takst them off
 With overwhelming sweep

 They flourish like the morning flowr
 In beautys pride arrayd
 But long ere night cut down it lies
 All witherd and decayd




Prayer In The Prospect Of Death

 O Thou unknown Almighty Cause
 Of all my hope and fear
 In whose dread presence ere an hour
 Perhaps I must appear

 If I have wanderd in those paths
 Of life I ought to shun
 As something loudly in my breast
 Remonstrates I have done

 Thou knowst that Thou hast formed me
 With passions wild and strong
 And listning to their witching voice
 Has often led me wrong

 Where human weakness has come short
 Or frailty stept aside
 Do Thou AllGoodfor such Thou art
 In shades of darkness hide

 Where with intention I have errd
 No other plea I have
 But Thou art good and Goodness still
 Delighteth to forgive




Stanzas On The Same Occasion

 Why am I loth to leave this earthly scene
 Have I so found it full of pleasing charms
 Some drops of joy with draughts of ill between
 Some gleams of sunshine mid renewing storms
 Is it departing pangs my soul alarms
 Or deaths unlovely dreary dark abode
 For guilt for guilt my terrors are in arms
 I tremble to approach an angry God
 And justly smart beneath His sinavenging rod

 Fain would I say Forgive my foul offence
 Fain promise never more to disobey
 But should my Author health again dispense
 Again I might desert fair virtues way
 Again in follys part might go astray
 Again exalt the brute and sink the man
 Then how should I for heavenly mercy pray
 Who act so counter heavenly mercys plan
 Who sin so oft have mournd yet to temptation ran

 O Thou great Governor of all below
 If I may dare a lifted eye to Thee
 Thy nod can make the tempest cease to blow
 Or still the tumult of the raging sea
 With that controlling powr assist evn me
 Those headlong furious passions to confine
 For all unfit I feel my powrs to be
 To rule their torrent in th allowed line
 O aid me with Thy help Omnipotence Divine

Fickle Fortune A Fragment

 Though fickle Fortune has deceived me
 She pormisd fair and performd but ill
 Of mistress friends and wealth bereavd me
 Yet I bear a heart shall support me still

 Ill act with prudence as far s Im able
 But if success I must never find
 Then come misfortune I bid thee welcome
 Ill meet thee with an undaunted mind




Raging FortuneFragment Of Song

 O raging Fortunes withering blast
 Has laid my leaf full low O
 O raging Fortunes withering blast
 Has laid my leaf full low O

 And made my branches grow O

 But luckless Fortunes northern storms
 Laid a my blossoms low O

 Laid a my blossoms low O

SongNo Churchman Am I

 TunePrepare my dear Brethren to the tavern lets fly


 No churchman am I for to rail and to write
 No statesman nor soldier to plot or to fight
 No sly man of business contriving a snare
 For a bigbellyd bottles the whole of my care

 The peer I dont envy I give him his bow
 I scorn not the peasant though ever so low
 But a club of good fellows like those that are here
 And a bottle like this are my glory and care

 Here passes the squire on his brotherhis horse
 There centum per centum the cit with his purse
 But see you the Crown how it waves in the air
 There a bigbellyd bottle still eases my care

 The wife of my bosom alas she did die
 for sweet consolation to church I did fly
 I found that old Solomon proved it fair
 That a bigbellyd bottles a cure for all care

 I once was persuaded a venture to make
 A letter informd me that all was to wreck
 But the pursy old landlord just waddld upstairs
 With a glorious bottle that ended my cares

 Lifes cares they are comfortsa maxim laid down
 By the Bard what dye call him that wore the black gown
 And faith I agree with th old prig to a hair
 For a bigbellyd bottles a heavn of a care




A Stanza Added In A Mason Lodge

 Then fill up a bumper and make it oerflow
 And honours masonic prepare for to throw
 May evry true Brother of the Compass and Square
 Have a bigbellyd bottle when harassd with care




My Father Was A Farmer

 TuneThe weaver and his shuttle O


 My father was a farmer upon the Carrick border O
 And carefully he bred me in decency and order O
 He bade me act a manly part though I had neer a farthing O
 For without an honest manly heart no man was worth regarding O

 Then out into the world my course I did determine O
 Tho to be rich was not my wish yet to be great was charming O
 My talents they were not the worst nor yet my education O
 Resolvd was I at least to try to mend my situation O

 In many a way and vain essay I courted Fortunes favour O
 Some cause unseen still stept between to frustrate each endeavour O
 Sometimes by foes I was oerpowerd sometimes by friends forsaken O
 And when my hope was at the top I still was worst mistaken O

 Then sore harassd and tird at last with Fortunes vain delusion O
 I dropt my schemes like idle dreams and came to this conclusion O
 The past was bad and the future hid its good or ill untried O
 But the present hour was in my powr and so I would enjoy it O

 No help nor hope nor view had I nor person to befriend me O
 So I must toil and sweat and moil and labour to sustain me O
 To plough and sow to reap and mow my father bred me early O
 For one he said to labour bred was a match for Fortune fairly O

 Thus all obscure unknown and poor thro life Im doomd to wander O
 Till down my weary bones I lay in everlasting slumber O
 No view nor care but shun whateer might breed me pain or sorrow O
 I live today as wells I may regardless of tomorrow O

 But cheerful still I am as well as a monarch in his palace O
 Tho Fortunes frown still hunts me down with all her wonted malice O
 I make indeed my daily bread but neer can make it farther O
 But as daily bread is all I need I do not much regard her O

 When sometimes by my labour I earn a little money O
 Some unforeseen misfortune comes genrally upon me O
 Mischance mistake or by neglect or my goodnaturd folly O
 But come what will Ive sworn it still Ill neer be melancholy O

 All you who follow wealth and power with unremitting ardour O
 The more in this you look for bliss you leave your view the farther O
 Had you the wealth Potosi boasts or nations to adore you O
 A cheerful honesthearted clown I will prefer before you O




John Barleycorn A Ballad

 There was three kings into the east
 Three kings both great and high
 And they hae sworn a solemn oath
 John Barleycorn should die

 They took a plough and ploughd him down
 Put clods upon his head
 And they hae sworn a solemn oath
 John Barleycorn was dead

 But the cheerful Spring came kindly on
 And showrs began to fall
 John Barleycorn got up again
 And sore surprisd them all

 The sultry suns of Summer came
 And he grew thick and strong
 His head weel armd wi pointed spears
 That no one should him wrong

 The sober Autumn enterd mild
 When he grew wan and pale
 His bending joints and drooping head
 Showd he began to fail

 His colour sickend more and more
 He faded into age
 And then his enemies began
 To show their deadly rage

 Theyve taen a weapon long and sharp
 And cut him by the knee
 Then tied him fast upon a cart
 Like a rogue for forgerie

 They laid him down upon his back
 And cudgelld him full sore
 They hung him up before the storm
 And turned him oer and oer

 They filled up a darksome pit
 With water to the brim
 They heaved in John Barleycorn
 There let him sink or swim

 They laid him out upon the floor
 To work him farther woe
 And still as signs of life appeard
 They tossd him to and fro

 They wasted oer a scorching flame
 The marrow of his bones
 But a miller usd him worst of all
 For he crushd him between two stones

 And they hae taen his very hearts blood
 And drank it round and round
 And still the more and more they drank
 Their joy did more abound

 John Barleycorn was a hero bold
 Of noble enterprise
 For if you do but taste his blood
 Twill make your courage rise

 Twill make a man forget his woe
 Twill heighten all his joy
 Twill make the widows heart to sing
 Tho the tear were in her eye

 Then let us toast John Barleycorn
 Each man a glass in hand
 And may his great posterity
 Neer fail in old Scotland

Death And Dying Words Of Poor Mailie The Authors Only Pet Yowe The

An Unco Mournfu Tale

 As Mailie an her lambs thegither
 Was ae day nibbling on the tether
 Upon her cloot she coost a hitch
 An owre she warsld in the ditch
 There groaning dying she did lie
 When Hughoc he cam doytin by

 Wi glowrin een and lifted hans
 Poor Hughoc like a statue stans
 He saw her days were nearhand ended
 But waes my heart he could na mend it
 He gaped wide but naething spak
 At langth poor Mailie silence brak

 O thou whase lamentable face
 Appears to mourn my woefu case
 My dying words attentive hear
 An bear them to my Master dear

 Tell him if eer again he keep
 As muckle gear as buy a sheep
 O bid him never tie them mair
 Wi wicked strings o hemp or hair
 But ca them out to park or hill
 An let them wander at their will
 So may his flock increase an grow
 To scores o lambs an packs o woo

 Tell him he was a Master kin
 An aye was guid to me an mine
 An now my dying charge I gie him
 My helpless lambs I trust them wi him

 O bid him save their harmless lives
 Frae dogs an tods an butchers knives
 But gie them guid cowmilk their fill
 Till they be fit to fend themsel
 An tent them duly een an morn
 Wi taets o hay an ripps o corn

 An may they never learn the gaets
 Of ither vile wanrestfu pets
 To slink thro slaps an reave an steal
 At stacks o pease or stocks o kail
 So may they like their great forbears
 For mony a year come thro the shears
 So wives will gie them bits o bread
 An bairns greet for them when theyre dead

 My poor tooplamb my son an heir
 O bid him breed him up wi care
 An if he live to be a beast
 To pit some havins in his breast

 An warn himwhat I winna name
 To stay content wi yowes at hame
 An no to rin an wear his cloots
 Like ither menseless graceless brutes

 An neist my yowie silly thing
 Gude keep thee frae a tether string
 O may thou neer forgather up
 Wi ony blastit moorland toop
 But aye keep mind to moop an mell
 Wi sheep o credit like thysel

 And now my bairns wi my last breath
 I leae my blessin wi you baith
 An when you think upo your mither
 Mind to be kind to ane anither

 Now honest Hughoc dinna fail
 To tell my master a my tale
 An bid him burn this cursed tether
 An for thy pains thouse get my blather

 This said poor Mailie turnd her head
 And closd her een amang the dead




Poor Mailies Elegy

 Lament in rhyme lament in prose
 Wi saut tears trickling down your nose
 Our bardies fate is at a close
 Past a remead
 The last sad capestane o his woes
 Poor Mailies dead

 Its no the loss o warls gear
 That could sae bitter draw the tear
 Or mak our bardie dowie wear
 The mourning weed
 Hes lost a friend an neebor dear
 In Mailie dead

 Thro a the town she trotted by him
 A lang halfmile she could descry him
 Wi kindly bleat when she did spy him
 She ran wi speed
 A friend mair faithfu neer cam nigh him
 Than Mailie dead

 I wat she was a sheep o sense
 An could behave hersel wi mense
 Ill sayt she never brak a fence
 Thro thievish greed
 Our bardie lanely keeps the spence
 Sin Mailies dead

 Or if he wanders up the howe
 Her living image in her yowe
 Comes bleating till him owre the knowe
 For bits o bread
 An down the briny pearls rowe
 For Mailie dead

 She was nae get o moorland tips
 Wi tauted ket an hairy hips
 For her forbears were brought in ships
 Frae yont the Tweed
 A bonier fleesh neer crossd the clips
 Than Mailies dead

 Wae worth the man wha first did shape
 That vile wanchancie thinga raip
 It maks guid fellows girn an gape
 Wi chokin dread
 An Robins bonnet wave wi crape
 For Mailie dead

 O a ye bards on bonie Doon
 An wha on Ayr your chanters tune
 Come join the melancholious croon
 O Robins reed
 His heart will never get aboon
 His Mailies dead




SongThe Rigs O Barley

 TuneCorn Rigs are bonie


 It was upon a Lammas night
 When corn rigs are bonie
 Beneath the moons unclouded light
 I held awa to Annie
 The time flew by wi tentless heed
 Till tween the late and early
 Wi sma persuasion she agreed
 To see me thro the barley

 Corn rigs an barley rigs
 An corn rigs are bonie
 Ill neer forget that happy night
 Amang the rigs wi Annie

 The sky was blue the wind was still
 The moon was shining clearly
 I set her down wi right good will
 Amang the rigs o barley
 I kent her heart was a my ain
 I lovd her most sincerely

 I kissd her owre and owre again
 Amang the rigs o barley
 Corn rigs an barley rigs c

 I lockd her in my fond embrace
 Her heart was beating rarely
 My blessings on that happy place
 Amang the rigs o barley
 But by the moon and stars so bright
 That shone that hour so clearly
 She aye shall bless that happy night
 Amang the rigs o barley
 Corn rigs an barley rigs c

 I hae been blythe wi comrades dear
 I hae been merry drinking
 I hae been joyfu gathrin gear
 I hae been happy thinking
 But a the pleasures eer I saw
 Tho three times doubld fairly
 That happy night was worth them a
 Amang the rigs o barley
 Corn rigs an barley rigs c




Song Composed In August

 TuneI had a horse I had nae mair


 Now westlin winds and slaughtring guns
 Bring Autumns pleasant weather
 The moorcock springs on whirring wings
 Amang the blooming heather
 Now waving grain wide oer the plain
 Delights the weary farmer
 And the moon shines bright when I rove at night
 To muse upon my charmer

 The partridge loves the fruitful fells
 The plover loves the mountains
 The woodcock haunts the lonely dells
 The soaring hern the fountains
 Thro lofty groves the cushat roves
 The path of man to shun it
 The hazel bush oerhangs the thrush
 The spreading thorn the linnet

 Thus evry kind their pleasure find
 The savage and the tender
 Some social join and leagues combine
 Some solitary wander
 Avaunt away the cruel sway
 Tyrannic mans dominion
 The sportsmans joy the murdring cry
 The fluttring gory pinion

 But Peggy dear the evnings clear
 Thick flies the skimming swallow
 The sky is blue the fields in view
 All fadinggreen and yellow
 Come let us stray our gladsome way
 And view the charms of Nature
 The rustling corn the fruited thorn
 And evry happy creature

 Well gently walk and sweetly talk
 Till the silent moon shine clearly
 Ill grasp thy waist and fondly prest
 Swear how I love thee dearly
 Not vernal showrs to budding flowrs
 Not Autumn to the farmer
 So dear can be as thou to me
 My fair my lovely charmer




Song

 TuneMy Nanie O


 Behind yon hills where Lugar flows
 Mang moors an mosses many O
 The wintry sun the day has closd
 And Ill awa to Nanie O

 The westlin wind blaws loud an shill
 The nights baith mirk and rainy O
 But Ill get my plaid an out Ill steal
 An owre the hill to Nanie O

 Nae artfu wiles to win ye O
 May ill befa the flattering tongue
 That wad beguile my Nanie O

 Her face is fair her heart is true
 As spotless as shes bonie O
 The opning gowan wat wi dew
 Nae purer is than Nanie O

 A country lad is my degree
 An few there be that ken me O
 But what care I how few they be
 Im welcome aye to Nanie O

 My riches as my pennyfee
 An I maun guide it cannie O
 But warls gear neer troubles me
 My thoughts are a my Nanie O

 Our auld guidman delights to view
 His sheep an kye thrive bonie O
 But Im as blythe that hands his pleugh
 An has nae care but Nanie O

 Come weel come woe I care na by
 Ill tak what Heavn will sen me O
 Nae ither care in life have I
 But live an love my Nanie O

 Indeed will I quo Findlay
 What may pass within this bower
 Let it pass quo Findlay
 Ye maun conceal till your last hour

Remorse A Fragment

 Of all the numerous ills that hurt our peace
 That press the soul or wring the mind with anguish
 Beyond comparison the worst are those
 By our own folly or our guilt brought on
 In evry other circumstance the mind
 Has this to say It was no deed of mine
 But when to all the evil of misfortune
 This sting is added Blame thy foolish self
 Or worser far the pangs of keen remorse
 The torturing gnawing consciousness of guilt
 Of guilt perhaps when weve involved others
 The young the innocent who fondly lovd us
 Nay more that very love their cause of ruin
 O burning hell in all thy store of torments
 Theres not a keener lash
 Lives there a man so firm who while his heart
 Feels all the bitter horrors of his crime
 Can reason down its agonizing throbs
 And after proper purpose of amendment
 Can firmly force his jarring thoughts to peace
 O happy happy enviable man
 O glorious magnanimity of soul




Epitaph On Wm Hood Senr In Tarbolton

 Here Souter Hood in death does sleep
 To hell if hes gane thither
 Satan gie him thy gear to keep
 Hell haud it weel thegither




Epitaph On James Grieve Laird Of Boghead Tarbolton

 Here lies Boghead amang the dead
 In hopes to get salvation
 But if such as he in Heavn may be
 Then welcome hail damnation




Epitaph On My Own Friend And My Fathers Friend Wm Muir In Tarbolton Mill

 An honest man here lies at rest
 As eer God with his image blest
 The friend of man the friend of truth
 The friend of age and guide of youth
 Few hearts like his with virtue warmd
 Few heads with knowledge so informed
 If theres another world he lives in bliss
 If there is none he made the best of this




Epitaph On My Ever Honoured Father

 O ye whose cheek the tear of pity stains
 Draw near with pious revrence and attend
 Here lie the loving husbands dear remains
 The tender father and the genrous friend
 The pitying heart that felt for human woe
 The dauntless heart that feard no human pride
 The friend of manto vice alone a foe
 For evn his failings leand to virtues side1

Ballad On The American War

 TuneKilliecrankie


 When Guilford good our pilot stood
 An did our hellim thraw man
 Ae night at tea began a plea
 Within America man
 Then up they gat the maskinpat
 And in the sea did jaw man
 An did nae less in full congress
 Than quite refuse our law man

 Then thro the lakes Montgomery takes
 I wat he was na slaw man
 Down Lowries Burn he took a turn
 And Carleton did ca man
 But yet whatreck he at Quebec
 Montgomerylike did fa man
 Wi sword in hand before his band
 Amang his enmies a man

 Poor Tammy Gage within a cage
 Was kept at Bostonha man
 Till Willie Howe took oer the knowe
 For Philadelphia man
 Wi sword an gun he thought a sin
 Guid Christian bluid to draw man
 But at New York wi knife an fork
 SirLoin he hacked sma man

 Burgoyne gaed up like spur an whip
 Till Fraser brave did fa man
 Then lost his way ae misty day
 In Saratoga shaw man
 Cornwallis fought as langs he dought
 An did the Buckskins claw man
 But Clintons glaive frae rust to save
 He hung it to the wa man

 Then Montague an Guilford too
 Began to fear a fa man
 And Sackville dour wha stood the stour
 The German chief to thraw man
 For Paddy Burke like ony Turk
 Nae mercy had at a man
 An Charlie Fox threw by the box
 An lowsd his tinkler jaw man

 Then Rockingham took up the game
 Till death did on him ca man
 When Shelburne meek held up his cheek
 Conform to gospel law man
 Saint Stephens boys wi jarring noise
 They did his measures thraw man
 For North an Fox united stocks
 An bore him to the wa man

 Then clubs an hearts were Charlies cartes
 He swept the stakes awa man
 Till the diamonds ace of Indian race
 Led him a sair faux pas man
 The Saxon lads wi loud placads
 On Chathams boy did ca man
 An Scotland drew her pipe an blew
 Up Willie waur them a man

 Behind the throne then Granvilles gone
 A secret word or twa man
 While slee Dundas arousd the class
 Benorth the Roman wa man
 An Chathams wraith in heavnly graith
 Inspired bardies saw man
 Wi kindling eyes cryd Willie rise
 Would I hae feard them a man

 But word an blow North Fox and Co
 Gowffd Willie like a ba man
 Till Suthron raise an coost their claise
 Behind him in a raw man
 An Caledon threw by the drone
 An did her whittle draw man
 An swoor fu rude thro dirt an bluid
 To mak it guid in law man




Reply To An Announcement By J Rankine On His Writing To The Poet
That A Girl In That Part Of The Country Was With A Child To Him

 Yet never met wi that surprise

Epistle To John Rankine

 Enclosing Some Poems

 O Rough rude readywitted Rankine
 The wale o cocks for fun an drinkin
 Theres mony godly folks are thinkin
 Your dreams and tricks
 Will send you Korahlike asinkin
 Straught to auld Nicks

 Ye hae saw mony cracks an cants
 And in your wicked drucken rants
 Ye mak a devil o the saunts
 An fill them fou
 And then their failings flaws an wants
 Are a seen thro

 Hypocrisy in mercy spare it
 That holy robe O dinna tear it
 Sparet for their sakes wha aften wear it
 The lads in black
 But your curst wit when it comes near it
 Rivest aff their back

 Think wicked Sinner wha yere skaithing
 Its just the Bluegown badge an claithing
 O saunts tak that ye leae them naething
 To ken them by
 Frae ony unregenerate heathen
 Like you or I

 Ive sent you here some rhyming ware
 A that I bargaind for an mair
 Sae when ye hae an hour to spare
 I will expect
 Yon sang yell sent wi cannie care
 And no neglect

 Tho faith sma heart hae I to sing
 My muse dow scarcely spread her wing
 Ive playd mysel a bonie spring
 An dancd my fill
 Id better gaen an sairt the king
 At Bunkjers Hill

 Twas ae night lately in my fun
 I gaed a rovin wi the gun
 An brought a paitrick to the grun
 A bonie hen
 And as the twilight was begun
 Thought nane wad ken

 The poor wee thing was little hurt
 I straikit it a wee for sport
 Neer thinkin they wad fash me fort
 But Deilmacare
 Somebody tells the poachercourt
 The hale affair

 Some auld usd hands had taen a note
 That sic a hen had got a shot
 I was suspected for the plot
 I scornd to lie
 So gat the whissle o my groat
 An payt the fee

 But by my gun o guns the wale
 An by my pouther an my hail
 An by my hen an by her tail
 I vow an swear
 The game shall pay oer muir an dale
 For this niest year

 As soons the clockintime is by
 An the wee pouts begun to cry
 Lord Ise hae sporting by an by
 For my gowd guinea
 Tho I should herd the buckskin kye
 Fort in Virginia

 Trowth they had muckle for to blame
 Twas neither broken wing nor limb
 But twathree draps about the wame
 Scarce thro the feathers
 An baith a yellow George to claim
 An thole their blethers

 It pits me aye as mads a hare
 So I can rhyme nor write nae mair
 But pennyworths again is fair
 When times expedient
 Meanwhile I am respected Sir
 Your most obedient

SongO Leave Novels1

 Footnote 1 Burns never published this poem

 O leave novels ye Mauchline belles
 Yere safer at your spinningwheel
 Such witching books are baited hooks
 For rakish rooks like Rob Mossgiel
 Your fine Tom Jones and Grandisons
 They make your youthful fancies reel
 They heat your brains and fire your veins
 And then youre prey for Rob Mossgiel

 Beware a tongue thats smoothly hung
 A heart that warmly seems to feel
 That feeling heart but acts a part
 Tis rakish art in Rob Mossgiel
 The frank address the soft caress
 Are worse than poisoned darts of steel
 The frank address and politesse
 Are all finesse in Rob Mossgiel




FragmentThe Mauchline Lady

 TuneI had a horse I had nae mair


 When first I came to Stewart Kyle
 My mind it was na steady
 Whereer I gaed whereer I rade
 A mistress still I had aye

 But when I came roun by Mauchline toun
 Not dreadin anybody
 My heart was caught before I thought
 And by a Mauchline lady




FragmentMy Girl Shes Airy

 TuneBlack Jock


 My girl shes airy shes buxom and gay
 Her breath is as sweet as the blossoms in May
 A touch of her lips it ravishes quite
 Shes always good naturd good humourd and free
 She dances she glances she smiles upon me
 I never am happy when out of her sight




The Belles Of Mauchline

 In Mauchline there dwells six proper young belles
 The pride of the place and its neighbourhood a
 Their carriage and dress a stranger would guess
 In Lonon or Paris theyd gotten it a

 Miss Smith she has wit and Miss Betty is braw
 Theres beauty and fortune to get wi Miss Morton
 But Armours the jewel for me o them a




Epitaph On A Noisy Polemic

 Below thir stanes lie Jamies banes
 O Death its my opinion
 Thou neer took such a blethrin bitch
 Into thy dark dominion




Epitaph On A Henpecked Country Squire

 As father Adam first was foold
 A case thats still too common
 Here lies man a woman ruled
 The devil ruled the woman




Epigram On The Said Occasion

 O Death hadst thou but spard his life
 Whom we this day lament
 We freely wad exchanged the wife
 And a been weel content

 Evn as he is cauld in his graff
 The swap we yet will dot
 Tak thou the carlins carcase aff
 Thouse get the saul oboot




Another

 One Queen Artemisia as old stories tell
 When deprived of her husband she loved so well
 In respect for the love and affection he showd her
 She reducd him to dust and she drank up the powder
 But Queen Netherplace of a diffrent complexion
 When called on to order the funral direction
 Would have eat her dead lord on a slender pretence
 Not to show her respect butto save the expense




On Tam The Chapman

 As Tam the chapman on a day
 WiDeath forgatherd by the way
 Weel pleasd he greets a wight so famous
 And Death was nae less pleasd wi Thomas
 Wha cheerfully lays down his pack
 And there blaws up a hearty crack
 His social friendly honest heart
 Sae tickled Death they could na part
 Sae after viewing knives and garters
 Death taks him hame to gie him quarters




Epitaph On John Rankine

 Ae day as Death that gruesome carl
 Was driving to the tither warl
 A mixtiemaxtie motley squad
 And mony a guiltbespotted lad
 Black gowns of each denomination
 And thieves of every rank and station
 From him that wears the star and garter
 To him that wintles in a halter
 Ashamed himself to see the wretches
 He mutters glowrin at the bitches

 By God Ill not be seen behint them
 Nor mang the spritual core present them
 Without at least ae honest man
 To grace this damnd infernal clan
 By Adamhill a glance he threw
 Lord God quoth he I have it now
 Theres just the man I want i faith
 And quickly stoppit Rankines breath




Lines On The Authors Death

 Written With The Supposed View Of
 Being Handed To Rankine After The Poets Interment


 He who of Rankine sang lies stiff and dead
 And a green grassy hillock hides his head
 Alas alas a devilish change indeed




Man Was Made To Mourn A Dirge

 When chill Novembers surly blast
 Made fields and forests bare
 One evning as I wanderd forth
 Along the banks of Ayr
 I spied a man whose aged step
 Seemd weary worn with care
 His face furrowd oer with years
 And hoary was his hair

 Young stranger whither wandrest thou
 Began the revrend sage
 Does thirst of wealth thy step constrain
 Or youthful pleasures rage
 Or haply prest with cares and woes
 Too soon thou hast began
 To wander forth with me to mourn
 The miseries of man

 The sun that overhangs yon moors
 Outspreading far and wide
 Where hundreds labour to support
 A haughty lordlings pride
 Ive seen yon weary wintersun
 Twice forty times return
 And evry time has added proofs
 That man was made to mourn

 O man while in thy early years
 How prodigal of time
 Misspending all thy precious hours
 Thy glorious youthful prime
 Alternate follies take the sway
 Licentious passions burn
 Which tenfold force gives Natures law
 That man was made to mourn

 Look not alone on youthful prime
 Or manhoods active might
 Man then is useful to his kind
 Supported in his right
 But see him on the edge of life
 With cares and sorrows worn
 Then Age and Wantoh illmatchd pair
 Shew man was made to mourn

 A few seem favourites of fate
 In pleasures lap carest
 Yet think not all the rich and great
 Are likewise truly blest
 But oh what crowds in evry land
 All wretched and forlorn
 Thro weary life this lesson learn
 That man was made to mourn

 Many and sharp the numrous ills
 Inwoven with our frame
 More pointed still we make ourselves
 Regret remorse and shame
 And man whose heavnerected face
 The smiles of love adorn
 Mans inhumanity to man
 Makes countless thousands mourn

 See yonder poor oerlabourd wight
 So abject mean and vile
 Who begs a brother of the earth
 To give him leave to toil
 And see his lordly fellowworm
 The poor petition spurn
 Unmindful tho a weeping wife
 And helpless offspring mourn

 If Im designd yon lordlings slave
 By Natures law designd
 Why was an independent wish
 Eer planted in my mind
 If not why am I subject to
 His cruelty or scorn
 Or why has man the will and powr
 To make his fellow mourn

 Yet let not this too much my son
 Disturb thy youthful breast
 This partial view of humankind
 Is surely not the last
 The poor oppressed honest man
 Had never sure been born
 Had there not been some recompense
 To comfort those that mourn

 O Death the poor mans dearest friend
 The kindest and the best
 Welcome the hour my aged limbs
 Are laid with thee at rest
 The great the wealthy fear thy blow
 From pomp and pleasure torn
 But oh a blest relief for those
 That wearyladen mourn

 He kennd the Lords sheep ilka tail

 An saw gin they were sick or hale

 Or nobly fling the gospel club
 And NewLight herds could nicely drub
 Or pay their skin
 Could shake them oer the burning dub
 Or heave them in

Epistle To Davie A Brother Poet

 January

 While winds frae aff BenLomond blaw
 An bar the doors wi driving snaw
 An hing us owre the ingle
 I set me down to pass the time
 An spin a verse or twa o rhyme
 In hamely westlin jingle
 While frosty winds blaw in the drift
 Ben to the chimla lug
 I grudge a wee the greatfolks gift
 That live sae bien an snug
 I tent less and want less
 Their roomy fireside
 But hanker and canker
 To see their cursed pride

 Its hardly in a bodys powr
 To keep at times frae being sour
 To see how things are shard
 How best o chiels are whiles in want
 While coofs on countless thousands rant
 And ken na how to wairt
 But Davie lad neer fash your head
 Tho we hae little gear
 Were fit to win our daily bread
 As langs were hale and fier
 Mair spier na nor fear na1
 Auld age neer mind a feg
 The last ot the warst ot
 Is only but to beg

 To lie in kilns and barns at een
 When banes are crazd and bluid is thin
 Is doubtless great distress

 Footnote 1 RamsayR B

 Yet then content could make us blest
 Evn then sometimes wed snatch a taste
 Of truest happiness
 The honest heart thats free frae a
 Intended fraud or guile
 However Fortune kick the ba
 Has aye some cause to smile
 An mind still youll find still
 A comfort this nae sma
 Nae mair then well care then
 Nae farther can we fa

 What tho like commoners of air
 We wander out we know not where
 But either house or hal
 Yet natures charms the hills and woods
 The sweeping vales and foaming floods
 Are free alike to all
 In days when daisies deck the ground
 And blackbirds whistle clear
 With honest joy our hearts will bound
 To see the coming year
 On braes when we please then
 Well sit an sowth a tune
 Syne rhyme tillt well time tillt
 An singt when we hae done

 Its no in titles nor in rank
 Its no in wealth like Lonon bank
 To purchase peace and rest
 Its no in makin muckle mair
 Its no in books its no in lear
 To make us truly blest
 If happiness hae not her seat
 An centre in the breast
 We may be wise or rich or great
 But never can be blest
 Nae treasures nor pleasures
 Could make us happy lang
 The heart ayes the part aye
 That makes us right or wrang

 Think ye that sic as you and I
 Wha drudge an drive thro wet and dry
 Wi neverceasing toil
 Think ye are we less blest than they
 Wha scarcely tent us in their way
 As hardly worth their while
 Alas how aft in haughty mood
 Gods creatures they oppress
 Or else neglecting a thats guid
 They riot in excess
 Baith careless and fearless
 Of either heaven or hell
 Esteeming and deeming
 Its a an idle tale

 Then let us cheerfu acquiesce
 Nor make our scanty pleasures less
 By pining at our state
 And even should misfortunes come
 I here wha sit hae met wi some
 Ans thankfu for them yet
 They gie the wit of age to youth
 They let us ken oursel
 They make us see the naked truth
 The real guid and ill
 Tho losses an crosses
 Be lessons right severe
 Theres wit there yell get there
 Yell find nae other where

 But tent me Davie ace o hearts
 To say aught less wad wrang the cartes
 And flattry I detest
 This life has joys for you and I
 An joys that riches neer could buy
 An joys the very best
 Theres a the pleasures o the heart
 The lover an the frien
 Ye hae your Meg your dearest part
 And I my darling Jean
 It warms me it charms me
 To mention but her name
 It heats me it beets me
 An sets me a on flame

 O all ye Powrs who rule above
 O Thou whose very self art love
 Thou knowst my words sincere
 The lifeblood streaming thro my heart
 Or my more dear immortal part
 Is not more fondly dear
 When heartcorroding care and grief
 Deprive my soul of rest
 Her dear idea brings relief
 And solace to my breast
 Thou Being Allseeing
 O hear my fervent prayr
 Still take her and make her
 Thy most peculiar care

 All hail ye tender feelings dear
 The smile of love the friendly tear
 The sympathetic glow
 Long since this worlds thorny ways
 Had numberd out my weary days
 Had it not been for you
 Fate still has blest me with a friend
 In evry care and ill
 And oft a more endearing band
 A tie more tender still
 It lightens it brightens
 The tenebrific scene
 To meet with and greet with
 My Davie or my Jean

 O how that name inspires my style
 The words come skelpin rank an file
 Amaist before I ken
 The ready measure rins as fine
 As Phoebus an the famous Nine
 Were glowrin owre my pen
 My spaviet Pegasus will limp
 Till ance hes fairly het
 And then hell hilch and stilt an jimp
 And rin an unco fit
 But least then the beast then
 Should rue this hasty ride
 Ill light now and dight now
 His sweaty wizend hide




Holy Willies Prayer

 And send the godly in a pet to prayPope


Argument

Holy Willie was a rather oldish bachelor elder in the parish of
Mauchline and much and justly famed for that polemical chattering
which ends in tippling orthodoxy and for that spiritualized bawdry
which refines to liquorish devotion In a sessional process with a
gentleman in Mauchlinea Mr Gavin HamiltonHoly Willie and his
priest Father Auld after full hearing in the presbytery of Ayr came
off but second best owing partly to the oratorical powers of Mr Robert
Aiken Mr Hamiltons counsel but chiefly to Mr Hamiltons being one
of the most irreproachable and truly respectable characters in the
county On losing the process the muse overheard him Holy Willie
at his devotions as follows

 O Thou who in the heavens does dwell
 Who as it pleases best Thysel
 Sends ane to heaven an ten to hell
 A for Thy glory
 And no for ony gude or ill
 Theyve done afore Thee

 I bless and praise Thy matchless might
 When thousands Thou hast left in night
 That I am here afore Thy sight
 For gifts an grace
 A burning and a shining light
 To a this place

 What was I or my generation
 That I should get sic exaltation
 I wha deserve most just damnation
 For broken laws
 Five thousand years ere my creation
 Thro Adams cause

 When frae my mithers womb I fell
 Thou might hae plunged me in hell
 To gnash my gums to weep and wail
 In burnin lakes
 Where damned devils roar and yell
 Chaind to their stakes

 Yet I am here a chosen sample
 To show thy grace is great and ample
 Im here a pillar o Thy temple
 Strong as a rock
 A guide a buckler and example
 To a Thy flock

 O Lord Thou kens what zeal I bear
 When drinkers drink an swearers swear
 An singin there an dancin here
 Wi great and sma
 For I am keepit by Thy fear
 Free frae them a

 But yet O Lord confess I must
 At times Im fashd wi fleshly lust
 An sometimes too in wardly trust
 Vile self gets in
 But Thou remembers we are dust
 Defild wi sin

 O Lord yestreen Thou kens wi Meg
 Thy pardon I sincerely beg
 O mayt neer be a livin plague
 To my dishonour
 An Ill neer lift a lawless leg
 Again upon her

 Besides I farther maun allow
 Wi Leezies lass three times I trow
 But Lord that Friday I was fou
 When I cam near her
 Or else Thou kens Thy servant true
 Wad never steer her

 Maybe Thou lets this fleshly thorn
 Buffet Thy servant een and morn
 Lest he owre proud and high shoud turn
 That hes sae gifted
 If sae Thy han maun een be borne
 Until Thou lift it

 Lord bless Thy chosen in this place
 For here Thou hast a chosen race
 But God confound their stubborn face
 An blast their name
 Wha bring Thy elders to disgrace
 An public shame

 Lord mind Gawn Hamiltons deserts
 He drinks an swears an plays at cartes
 Yet has sae mony takin arts
 Wi great and sma
 Frae Gods ain priest the peoples hearts
 He steals awa

 An when we chastend him therefor
 Thou kens how he bred sic a splore
 An set the warld in a roar
 O laughing at us
 Curse Thou his basket and his store
 Kail an potatoes

 Lord hear my earnest cry and prayr
 Against that Presbytry o Ayr
 Thy strong right hand Lord make it bare
 Upo their heads
 Lord visit them an dinna spare
 For their misdeeds

 O Lord my God that glibtongud Aiken
 My vera heart and flesh are quakin
 To think how we stood sweatin shakin
 An pd wi dread
 While he wi hingin lip an snakin
 Held up his head

 Lord in Thy day o vengeance try him
 Lord visit them wha did employ him
 And pass not in Thy mercy by em
 Nor hear their prayr
 But for Thy peoples sake destroy em
 An dinna spare

 But Lord remember me an mine
 Wi mercies tempral an divine
 That I for grace an gear may shine
 Excelld by nane
 And a the glory shall be thine
 Amen Amen




Epitaph On Holy Willie

 Here Holy Willies sair worn clay
 Taks up its last abode
 His saul has taen some other way
 I fear the lefthand road

 Stop there he is as sures a gun
 Poor silly body see him
 Nae wonder hes as blacks the grun
 Observe whas standing wi him

 Your brunstane devilship I see
 Has got him there before ye
 But haud your ninetail cat a wee
 Till ance youve heard my story

 Your pity I will not implore
 For pity ye have nane
 Justice alas has gien him oer
 And mercys day is gane

 But hear me Sir deil as ye are
 Look something to your credit
 A coof like him wad stain your name
 If it were kent ye did it

 And some great lies were never pennd
 Evn ministers they hae been kennd
 In holy rapture
 A rousing whid at times to vend
 And nailt wi Scripture

 But this that I am gaun to tell
 Which lately on a night befell
 Is just as trues the Deils in hell
 Or Dublin city
 That eer he nearer comes oursel
 S a muckle pity

 The clachan yill had made me canty
 I was na fou but just had plenty
 I stacherd whiles but yet too tent aye
 To free the ditches
 An hillocks stanes an bushes kennd eye
 Frae ghaists an witches

 The rising moon began to glowre
 The distant Cumnock hills outowre
 To count her horns wi a my powr
 I set mysel
 But whether she had three or four
 I coud na tell

 I was come round about the hill
 An todlin down on Willies mill
 Setting my staff wi a my skill
 To keep me sicker
 Tho leeward whiles against my will
 I took a bicker

 I there wi Something did forgather
 That pat me in an eerie swither
 An awfu scythe outowre ae shouther
 Cleardangling hang
 A threetaed leister on the ither
 Lay large an lang

 Its stature seemd lang Scotch ells twa
 The queerest shape that eer I saw
 For fient a wame it had ava
 And then its shanks
 They were as thin as sharp an sma
 As cheeks o branks

 Guideen quo I Friend hae ye been mawin
 When ither folk are busy sawin1
 I seemd to make a kind o stan
 But naething spak
 At length says I Friend whare ye gaun
 Will ye go back

 It spak right howeMy name is Death
 But be na fleydQuoth I Guid faith
 Yere maybe come to stap my breath
 But tent me billie
 I red ye weel tak care o skaith
 See theres a gully

 Gudeman quo he put up your whittle
 Im no designed to try its mettle
 But if I did I wad be kittle
 To be misleard
 I wad na mind it no that spittle
 Outowre my beard

 Weel weel says I a bargain bet
 Come gies your hand an sae were greet
 Well ease our shanks an tak a seat
 Come gies your news
 This while ye hae been mony a gate
 At mony a house2

 Footnote 1 This recontre happened in seedtime 1785RB

 Footnote 2 An epidemical fever was then raging in that
 countryRB

 Ay ay quo he an shook his head
 Its een a lang lang time indeed
 Sin I began to nick the thread
 An choke the breath
 Folk maun do something for their bread
 An sae maun Death

 Sax thousand years are nearhand fled
 Sin I was to the butching bred
 An mony a scheme in vains been laid
 To stap or scar me
 Till ane Hornbooks3 taen up the trade
 And faith hell waur me

 Ye ken Hornbook i the clachan
 Deil mak his kingshood in spleuchan
 Hes grown sae weel acquaint wi Buchan4
 And ither chaps
 The weans haud out their fingers laughin
 An pouk my hips

 See heres a scythe an theres dart
 They hae piercd mony a gallant heart
 But Doctor Hornbook wi his art
 An cursed skill
 Has made them baith no worth a ft
 Damnd haet theyll kill

 Twas but yestreen nae farther gane
 I threw a noble throw at ane
 Wi less Im sure Ive hundreds slain
 But deilmacare
 It just playd dirl on the bane
 But did nae mair

 Hornbook was by wi ready art
 An had sae fortifyd the part

 Footnote 3 This gentleman Dr Hornbook is professionally
 a brother of the sovereign Order of the Ferula but by
 intuition and inspiration is at once an apothecary
 surgeon and physicianRB

 Footnote 4 Burchans Domestic MedicineRB

 That when I looked to my dart
 It was sae blunt
 Fient haet ot wad hae piercd the heart
 Of a kailrunt

 I drew my scythe in sic a fury
 I nearhand cowpit wi my hurry
 But yet the bauld Apothecary
 Withstood the shock
 I might as weel hae tried a quarry
 O hard whin rock

 Evn them he canna get attended
 Altho their face he neer had kend it
 Justin a kailblade an sent it
 As soons he smells t
 Baith their disease and what will mend it
 At once he tells t

 And then a doctors saws an whittles
 Of a dimensions shapes an mettles
 A kind o boxes mugs an bottles
 Hes sure to hae
 Their Latin names as fast he rattles
 as A B C

 Calces o fossils earths and trees
 True salmarinum o the seas
 The farina of beans an pease
 He hast in plenty
 Aquafontis what you please
 He can content ye

 Forbye some new uncommon weapons
 Urinus spiritus of capons
 Or mitehorn shavings filings scrapings
 Distilld per se
 Salalkali o midgetail clippings
 And mony mae

 Waes me for Johnie Geds5 Hole now
 Quoth I if that thae news be true
 His braw calfward whare gowans grew
 Sae white and bonie
 Nae doubt theyll rive it wi the plew
 Theyll ruin Johnie

 The creature graind an eldritch laugh
 And says Ye needna yoke the pleugh
 Kirkyards will soon be tilld eneugh
 Tak ye nae fear
 Theyll be trenchd wi mony a sheugh
 In twathree year

 Whare I killd ane a fair straedeath
 By loss o blood or want of breath
 This night Im free to tak my aith
 That Hornbooks skill
 Has clad a score i their last claith
 By drap an pill

 An honest wabster to his trade
 Whase wifes twa nieves were scarce weelbred
 Gat tippenceworth to mend her head
 When it was sair
 The wife slade cannie to her bed
 But neer spak mair

 A country laird had taen the batts
 Or some curmurring in his guts
 His only son for Hornbook sets
 An pays him well
 The lad for twa guid gimmerpets
 Was laird himsel

 A bonie lassye kend her name
 Some illbrewn drink had hovd her wame
 She trusts hersel to hide the shame
 In Hornbooks care
 Horn sent her aff to her lang hame
 To hide it there

 Footnote 5 The gravediggerRB

 Thats just a swatch o Hornbooks way
 Thus goes he on from day to day
 Thus does he poison kill an slay
 Ans weel paid fort
 Yet stops me o my lawfu prey
 Wi his damnd dirt

 But hark Ill tell you of a plot
 Tho dinna ye be speakin ot
 Ill nail the selfconceited sot
 As deads a herrin
 Neist time we meet Ill wad a groat
 He gets his fairin

 But just as he began to tell
 The auld kirkhammer strak the bell
 Some wee short hour ayont the twal
 Which raisd us baith
 I took the way that pleasd mysel
 And sae did Death




Epistle To J Lapraik An Old Scottish Bard

 April 1 1785

 While briers an woodbines budding green
 An paitricks scraichin loud at een
 An morning poussie whiddin seen
 Inspire my muse
 This freedom in an unknown frien
 I pray excuse

 On Fasteneen we had a rockin
 To ca the crack and weave our stockin
 And there was muckle fun and jokin
 Ye need na doubt
 At length we had a hearty yokin
 At sang about

 There was ae sang amang the rest
 Aboon them a it pleasd me best
 That some kind husband had addrest
 To some sweet wife
 It thirld the heartstrings thro the breast
 A to the life

 Ive scarce heard ought describd sae weel
 What genrous manly bosoms feel
 Thought I Can this be Pope or Steele
 Or Beatties wark
 They tauld me twas an odd kind chiel
 About Muirkirk

 It pat me fidginfain to heart
 An sae about him there I speirt
 Then a that kent him round declard
 He had ingine
 That nane excelld it few cam neart
 It was sae fine

 That set him to a pint of ale
 An either douce or merry tale
 Or rhymes an sangs hed made himsel
 Or witty catches
 Tween Inverness an Teviotdale
 He had few matches

 Then up I gat an swoor an aith
 Tho I should pawn my pleugh an graith
 Or die a cadger pownies death
 At some dykeback
 A pint an gill Id gie them baith
 To hear your crack

 But first an foremost I should tell
 Amaist as soon as I could spell
 I to the crambojingle fell
 Tho rude an rough
 Yet crooning to a bodys sel
 Does weel eneugh

 I am nae poet in a sense
 But just a rhymer like by chance
 An hae to learning nae pretence
 Yet what the matter
 Wheneer my muse does on me glance
 I jingle at her

 Your criticfolk may cock their nose
 And say How can you eer propose
 You wha ken hardly verse frae prose
 To mak a sang
 But by your leaves my learned foes
 Yere maybe wrang

 Whats a your jargon o your schools
 Your Latin names for horns an stools
 If honest Nature made you fools
 What sairs your grammars
 Yed better taen up spades and shools
 Or knappinhammers

 A set o dull conceited hashes
 Confuse their brains in college classes
 They gang in stirks and come out asses
 Plain truth to speak
 An syne they think to climb Parnassus
 By dint o Greek

 Gie me ae spark o natures fire
 Thats a the learning I desire
 Then tho I drudge thro dub an mire
 At pleugh or cart
 My muse tho hamely in attire
 May touch the heart

 O for a spunk o Allans glee
 Or Fergussons the bauld an slee
 Or bright Lapraiks my friend to be
 If I can hit it
 That would be lear eneugh for me
 If I could get it

 Now sir if ye hae friends enow
 Tho real friends I blieve are few
 Yet if your catalogue be fu
 Ise no insist
 But gif ye want ae friend thats true
 Im on your list

 I winna blaw about mysel
 As ill I like my fauts to tell
 But friends an folk that wish me well
 They sometimes roose me
 Tho I maun own as mony still
 As far abuse me

 Theres ae wee faut they whiles lay to me
 I like the lassesGude forgie me
 For mony a plack they wheedle frae me
 At dance or fair
 Maybe some ither thing they gie me
 They weel can spare

 But Mauchline Race or Mauchline Fair
 I should be proud to meet you there
 Wese gie ae nights discharge to care
 If we forgather
 An hae a swap o rhyminware
 Wi ane anither

 The fourgill chap wese gar him clatter
 An kirsen him wi reekin water
 Syne well sit down an tak our whitter
 To cheer our heart
 An faith wese be acquainted better
 Before we part

 Awa ye selfish warly race
 Wha think that havins sense an grace
 Evn love an friendship should give place
 To catchtheplack
 I dinna like to see your face
 Nor hear your crack

 But ye whom social pleasure charms
 Whose hearts the tide of kindness warms
 Who hold your being on the terms
 Each aid the others
 Come to my bowl come to my arms
 My friends my brothers

 But to conclude my lang epistle
 As my auld pens worn to the gristle
 Twa lines frae you wad gar me fissle
 Who am most fervent
 While I can either sing or whistle
 Your friend and servant




Second Epistle To J Lapraik

 April 21 1785

 While newcad kye rowte at the stake
 An pownies reek in pleugh or braik
 This hour on eenins edge I take
 To own Im debtor
 To honesthearted auld Lapraik
 For his kind letter

 Forjesket sair with weary legs
 Rattlin the corn outowre the rigs
 Or dealing thro amang the naigs
 Their tenhours bite
 My awkart Muse sair pleads and begs
 I would na write

 The tapetless ramfeezld hizzie
 Shes saft at best an something lazy
 Quo she Ye ken weve been sae busy
 This month an mair
 That trowth my head is grown right dizzie
 An something sair

 Her dowff excuses pat me mad
 Conscience says I ye thowless jade
 Ill write an that a hearty blaud
 This vera night
 So dinna ye affront your trade
 But rhyme it right

 Shall bauld Lapraik the king o hearts
 Tho mankind were a pack o cartes
 Roose you sae weel for your deserts
 In terms sae friendly
 Yet yell neglect to shaw your parts
 An thank him kindly

 Sae I gat paper in a blink
 An down gaed stumpie in the ink
 Quoth I Before I sleep a wink
 I vow Ill close it
 An if ye winna mak it clink
 By Jove Ill prose it

 Sae Ive begun to scrawl but whether
 In rhyme or prose or baith thegither
 Or some hotchpotch thats rightly neither
 Let time mak proof
 But I shall scribble down some blether
 Just clean affloof

 My worthy friend neer grudge an carp
 Tho fortune use you hard an sharp
 Come kittle up your moorland harp
 Wi gleesome touch
 Neer mind how Fortune waft and warp
 Shes but a bitch

 She s gien me mony a jirt an fleg
 Sin I could striddle owre a rig
 But by the Lord tho I should beg
 Wi lyart pow
 Ill laugh an sing an shake my leg
 As langs I dow

 Now comes the saxantwentieth simmer
 Ive seen the bud upon the timmer
 Still persecuted by the limmer
 Frae year to year
 But yet despite the kittle kimmer
 I Rob am here

 Do ye envy the city gent
 Behint a kist to lie an sklent
 Or pursueproud big wi cent per cent
 An muckle wame
 In some bit brugh to represent
 A bailies name

 Or ist the paughty feudal thane
 Wi ruffld sark an glancing cane
 Wha thinks himsel nae sheepshank bane
 But lordly stalks
 While caps and bonnets aff are taen
 As by he walks

 O Thou wha gies us each guid gift
 Gie me o wit an sense a lift
 Then turn me if thou please adrift
 Thro Scotland wide
 Wi cits nor lairds I wadna shift
 In a their pride

 Were this the charter of our state
 On pain o hell be rich an great
 Damnation then would be our fate
 Beyond remead
 But thanks to heaven thats no the gate
 We learn our creed

 For thus the royal mandate ran
 When first the human race began
 The social friendly honest man
 Whateer he be
 Tis he fulfils great Natures plan
 And none but he

 O mandate glorious and divine
 The ragged followers o the Nine
 Poor thoughtless devils yet may shine
 In glorious light
 While sordid sons o Mammons line
 Are dark as night

 Tho here they scrape an squeeze an growl
 Their worthless nievefu of a soul
 May in some future carcase howl
 The forests fright
 Or in some daydetesting owl
 May shun the light

 Then may Lapraik and Burns arise
 To reach their native kindred skies
 And sing their pleasures hopes an joys
 In some mild sphere
 Still closer knit in friendships ties
 Each passing year




Epistle To William Simson

 Schoolmaster OchiltreeMay 1785

 I gat your letter winsome Willie
 Wi gratefu heart I thank you brawlie
 Tho I maun sayt I wad be silly
 And unco vain
 Should I believe my coaxin billie
 Your flatterin strain

 But Ise believe ye kindly meant it
 I sud be laith to think ye hinted
 Ironic satire sidelins sklented
 On my poor Musie
 Tho in sic phraisin terms yeve pennd it
 I scarce excuse ye

 My senses wad be in a creel
 Should I but dare a hope to speel
 Wi Allan or wi Gilbertfield
 The braes o fame
 Or Fergusson the writerchiel
 A deathless name

 O Fergusson thy glorious parts
 Ill suited laws dry musty arts
 My curse upon your whunstane hearts
 Ye Enbrugh gentry
 The tithe o what ye waste at cartes
 Wad stowd his pantry

 Yet when a tale comes i my head
 Or lassies gie my heart a screed
 As whiles theyre like to be my dead
 O sad disease
 I kittle up my rustic reed
 It gies me ease

 Auld Coila now may fidge fu fain
 Shes gotten poets o her ain
 Chiels wha their chanters winna hain
 But tune their lays
 Till echoes a resound again
 Her weelsung praise

 Nae poet thought her worth his while
 To set her name in measurd style
 She lay like some unkenndofisle
 Beside New Holland
 Or whare wildmeeting oceans boil
 Besouth Magellan

 Ramsay an famous Fergusson
 Gied Forth an Tay a lift aboon
 Yarrow an Tweed to monie a tune
 Owre Scotland rings
 While Irwin Lugar Ayr an Doon
 Naebody sings

 Th Illissus Tiber Thames an Seine
 Glide sweet in monie a tunefu line
 But Willie set your fit to mine
 An cock your crest
 Well gar our streams an burnies shine
 Up wi the best

 Well sing auld Coilas plains an fells
 Her moors redbrown wi heather bells
 Her banks an braes her dens and dells
 Whare glorious Wallace
 Aft bure the gree as story tells
 Frae Suthron billies

 At Wallace name what Scottish blood
 But boils up in a springtide flood
 Oft have our fearless fathers strode
 By Wallace side
 Still pressing onward redwatshod
 Or glorious died

 O sweet are Coilas haughs an woods
 When lintwhites chant amang the buds
 And jinkin hares in amorous whids
 Their loves enjoy
 While thro the braes the cushat croods
 With wailfu cry

 Evn winter bleak has charms to me
 When winds rave thro the naked tree
 Or frosts on hills of Ochiltree
 Are hoary gray
 Or blinding drifts wildfurious flee
 Darkning the day

 O Nature a thy shews an forms
 To feeling pensive hearts hae charms
 Whether the summer kindly warms
 Wi life an light
 Or winter howls in gusty storms
 The lang dark night

 The muse nae poet ever fand her
 Till by himsel he learnd to wander
 Adown some trottin burns meander
 An no think lang
 O sweet to stray an pensive ponder
 A heartfelt sang

 The warly race may drudge an drive
 Hogshouther jundie stretch an strive
 Let me fair Natures face descrive
 And I wi pleasure
 Shall let the busy grumbling hive
 Bum owre their treasure

 Fareweel my rhymecomposing brither
 Weve been owre lang unkennd to ither
 Now let us lay our heads thegither
 In love fraternal
 May envy wallop in a tether
 Black fiend infernal

 While Highlandmen hate tools an taxes
 While moorlans herds like guid fat braxies
 While terra firma on her axis
 Diurnal turns
 Count on a friend in faith an practice
 In Robert Burns




Postcript

 My memorys no worth a preen
 I had amaist forgotten clean
 Ye bade me write you what they mean
 By this newlight
 Bout which our herds sae aft hae been
 Maist like to fight

 In days when mankind were but callans
 At grammar logic an sic talents
 They took nae pains their speech to balance
 Or rules to gie
 But spak their thoughts in plain braid lallans
 Like you or me

 In thae auld times they thought the moon
 Just like a sark or pair o shoon
 Wore by degrees till her last roon
 Gaed past their viewin
 An shortly after she was done
 They gat a new ane

 This passed for certain undisputed
 It neer cam i their heads to doubt it
 Till chiels gat up an wad confute it
 An cad it wrang
 An muckle din there was about it
 Baith loud an lang

 Some herds weel learnd upo the beuk
 Wad threap auld folk the thing misteuk
 For twas the auld moon turnd a neuk
 An out of sight
 An backlinscomin to the leuk
 She grew mair bright

 This was denyd it was affirmd
 The herds and hissels were alarmd
 The revrend graybeards ravd an stormd
 That beardless laddies
 Should think they better wer informd
 Than their auld daddies

 Frae less to mair it gaed to sticks
 Frae words an aiths to clours an nicks
 An monie a fallow gat his licks
 Wi hearty crunt
 An some to learn them for their tricks
 Were hangd an brunt

 This game was playd in mony lands
 An auldlight caddies bure sic hands
 That faith the youngsters took the sands
 Wi nimble shanks
 Till lairds forbad by strict commands
 Sic bluidy pranks

 But newlight herds gat sic a cowe
 Folk thought them ruind stickanstowe
 Till now amaist on evry knowe
 Yell find ane placd
 An some their newlight fair avow
 Just quite barefacd

 Nae doubt the auldlight flocks are bleatin
 Their zealous herds are vexd an sweatin
 Mysel Ive even seen them greetin
 Wi girnin spite
 To hear the moon sae sadly lied on
 By word an write

 But shortly they will cowe the louns
 Some auldlight herds in neebor touns
 Are mindt in things they ca balloons
 To tak a flight
 An stay ae month amang the moons
 An see them right

 Guid observation they will gie them
 An when the auld moons gaun to leae them
 The hindmaist shaird theyll fetch it wi them
 Just i their pouch
 An when the newlight billies see them
 I think theyll crouch

 Sae ye observe that a this clatter
 Is naething but a moonshine matter
 But tho dull prosefolk Latin splatter
 In logic tulyie
 I hope we bardies ken some better
 Than mind sic brulyie




One Night As I Did Wander

 TuneJohn Anderson my jo


 One night as I did wander
 When corn begins to shoot
 I sat me down to ponder
 Upon an auld tree root
 Auld Ayr ran by before me
 And bickerd to the seas
 A cushat crooded oer me
 That echoed through the braes
       




Tho Cruel Fate Should Bid Us Part

 TuneThe Northern Lass


 Tho cruel fate should bid us part
 Far as the pole and line
 Her dear idea round my heart
 Should tenderly entwine
 Tho mountains rise and deserts howl
 And oceans roar between
 Yet dearer than my deathless soul
 I still would love my Jean

Elegy On The Death Of Robert Ruisseaux1

 Now Robin lies in his last lair
 Hell gabble rhyme nor sing nae mair
 Cauld poverty wi hungry stare
 Nae mair shall fear him
 Nor anxious fear nor cankert care
 Eer mair come near him

 To tell the truth they seldom fashd him
 Except the moment that they crushd him
 For sune as chance or fate had hushd em
 Tho eer sae short
 Then wi a rhyme or sang he lashd em
 And thought it sport

 Footnote 1 Ruisseaux is French for rivulets
 or burns a translation of his name

 Thohe was bred to kintrawark
 And counted was baith wight and stark
 Yet that was never Robins mark
 To mak a man
 But tell him he was learnd and clark
 Ye roosd him then




Epistle To John Goldie In Kilmarnock

 Author Of The Gospel RecoveredAugust 1785

 O Gowdie terror o the whigs
 Dread o blackcoats and revrend wigs
 Sour Bigotry on her last legs
 Girns an looks back
 Wishing the ten Egyptian plagues
 May seize you quick

 Poor gapin glowrin Superstition
 Waes me shes in a sad condition
 Fye bring Black Jock1 her state physician
 To see her water
 Alas theres ground for great suspicion
 Shell neer get better

 Enthusiasms past redemption
 Gane in a gallopin consumption
 Not a her quacks wi a their gumption
 Can ever mend her
 Her feeble pulse gies strong presumption
 Shell soon surrender

 Auld Orthodoxy lang did grapple
 For every hole to get a stapple
 But now she fetches at the thrapple
 An fights for breath
 Haste gie her name up in the chapel2
 Near unto death

 Its you an Taylor3 are the chief
 To blame for a this black mischief

 Footnote 1 The Rev J Russell KilmarnockR B

 Footnote 2 Mr Russells KirkR B

 Footnote 3 Dr Taylor of NorwichR B

 But could the Lords ain folk get leave
 A toom tar barrel
 An twa red peats wad bring relief
 And end the quarrel

 For me my skills but very sma
 An skill in prose Ive nane ava
 But quietlinswise between us twa
 Weel may you speed
 And tho they sud your sair misca
 Neer fash your head

 Een swinge the dogs and thresh them sicker
 The mair they squeel aye chap the thicker
 And still mang hands a hearty bicker
 O something stout
 It gars an owthors pulse beat quicker
 And helps his wit

 Theres naething like the honest nappy
 Wharell ye eer see men sae happy
 Or women sonsie saft an sappy
 Tween morn and morn
 As them wha like to taste the drappie
 In glass or horn

 Ive seen me dazed upon a time
 I scarce could wink or see a styme
 Just ae halfmutchkin does me prime
 Ought less is little
 Then back I rattle on the rhyme
 As glegs a whittle




The Holy Fair1

 A robe of seeming truth and trust
 Hid crafty Observation
 And secret hung with poisond crust
 The dirk of Defamation

 Footnote 1 Holy Fair is a common phrase in the west of Scotland
 for a sacramental occasionR B

 A mask that like the gorget showd
 Dyevarying on the pigeon
 And for a mantle large and broad
 He wrapt him in Religion
 Hypocrisy ALaMode

 Upon a simmer Sunday morn
 When Natures face is fair
 I walked forth to view the corn
 An snuff the caller air
 The rising sun owre Galston muirs
 Wi glorious light was glintin
 The hares were hirplin down the furrs
 The lavrocks they were chantin
 Fu sweet that day

 As lightsomely I glowrd abroad
 To see a scene sae gay
 Three hizzies early at the road
 Cam skelpin up the way
 Twa had manteeles o dolefu black
 But ane wi lyart lining
 The third that gaed a wee aback
 Was in the fashion shining
 Fu gay that day

 The twa appeard like sisters twin
 In feature form an claes
 Their visage witherd lang an thin
 An sour as only slaes
 The third cam up hapstapanlowp
 As light as ony lambie
 An wia curchie low did stoop
 As soon as eer she saw me
 Fu kind that day

 Wi bonnet aff quoth I Sweet lass
 I think ye seem to ken me
 Im sure Ive seen that bonie face
 But yet I canna name ye
 Quo she an laughin as she spak
 An taks me by the hans
 Ye for my sake hae gien the feck
 Of a the ten commans
 A screed some day

 My name is Funyour cronie dear
 The nearest friend ye hae
 An this is Superstitution here
 An thats Hypocrisy
 Im gaun to Mauchline Holy Fair
 To spend an hour in daffin
 Gin yell go there yon runkld pair
 We will get famous laughin
 At them this day

 Quoth I Wi a my heart Ill dot
 Ill get my Sundays sark on
 An meet you on the holy spot
 Faith wese hae fine remarkin
 Then I gaed hame at crowdietime
 An soon I made me ready
 For roads were clad frae side to side
 Wi mony a weary body
 In droves that day

 Here farmers gash in ridin graith
 Gaed hoddin by their cotters
 There swankies young in braw braidclaith
 Are springing owre the gutters
 The lasses skelpin barefit thrang
 In silks an scarlets glitter
 Wi sweetmilk cheese in mony a whang
 An farls bakd wi butter
 Fu crump that day

 When by the plate we set our nose
 Weel heaped up wi hapence
 A greedy glowr blackbonnet throws
 An we maun draw our tippence
 Then in we go to see the show
 On evry side theyre gathrin
 Some carrying dails some chairs an stools
 An some are busy blethrin
 Right loud that day

 Here stands a shed to fend the showrs
 An screen our countra gentry
 There Racer Jess2 an twathree whores
 Are blinkin at the entry
 Here sits a raw o tittlin jads
 Wi heaving breast an bare neck
 An there a batch o wabster lads
 Blackguarding frae Kilmarnock
 For fun this day

 Here some are thinkin on their sins
 An some upo their claes
 Ane curses feet that fyld his shins
 Anither sighs an prays
 On this hand sits a chosen swatch
 Wi screwedup graceproud faces
 On that a set o chaps at watch
 Thrang winkin on the lasses
 To chairs that day

 O happy is that man an blest
 Nae wonder that it pride him
 Whase ain dear lass that he likes best
 Comes clinkin down beside him
 Wi arms reposd on the chair back
 He sweetly does compose him
 Which by degrees slips round her neck
 Ans loof upon her bosom
 Unkend that day

 Now a the congregation oer
 Is silent expectation
 For Moodie3 speels the holy door
 Wi tidings o damnation

 Footnote 2 Racer Jess d 1813 was a halfwitted daughter of
 Possie Nansie She was a great pedestrian

 Footnote 3 Rev Alexander Moodie of Riccarton

 Should Hornie as in ancient days
 Mang sons o God present him
 The vera sight o Moodies face
 To s ain het hame had sent him
 Wi fright that day

 Hear how he clears the point o faith
 Wi rattlin and wi thumpin
 Now meekly calm now wild in wrath
 Hes stampin an hes jumpin
 His lengthend chin his turnedup snout
 His eldritch squeel an gestures
 O how they fire the heart devout
 Like cantharidian plaisters
 On sic a day

 But hark the tent has changd its voice
 Theres peace an rest nae langer
 For a the real judges rise
 They canna sit for anger
 Smith4 opens out his cauld harangues
 On practice and on morals
 An aff the godly pour in thrangs
 To gie the jars an barrels
 A lift that day

 What signifies his barren shine
 Of moral powers an reason
 His English style an gesture fine
 Are a clean out o season
 Like Socrates or Antonine
 Or some auld pagan heathen
 The moral man he does define
 But neer a word o faith in
 Thats right that day

 In guid time comes an antidote
 Against sic poisond nostrum
 For Peebles5 frae the waterfit
 Ascends the holy rostrum

 Footnote 4 Rev George Smith of Galston

 Footnote 5 Rev Wm Peebles of NewtonuponAyr

 See up hes got the word o God
 An meek an mim has viewd it
 While Commonsense has taen the road
 An aff an up the Cowgate6
 Fast fast that day

 Wee Miller7 neist the guard relieves
 An Orthodoxy raibles
 Tho in his heart he weel believes
 An thinks it auld wives fables
 But faith the birkie wants a manse
 So cannilie he hums them
 Altho his carnal wit an sense
 Like hafflinswise oercomes him
 At times that day

 Now butt an ben the changehouse fills
 Wi yillcaup commentators
 Here s cryin out for bakes and gills
 An there the pintstowp clatters
 While thick an thrang an loud an lang
 Wi logic an wi scripture
 They raise a din that in the end
 Is like to breed a rupture
 O wrath that day

 Leeze me on drink it gies us mair
 Than either school or college
 It kindles wit it waukens lear
 It pangs us fou o knowledge
 Bet whiskygill or penny wheep
 Or ony stronger potion
 It never fails or drinkin deep
 To kittle up our notion
 By night or day

 The lads an lasses blythely bent
 To mind baith saul an body
 Sit round the table weel content
 An steer about the toddy

 Footnote 7 Rev Alex Miller afterward of Kilmaurs

 On this anes dress an that anes leuk
 Theyre makin observations
 While some are cozie i the neuk
 An forming assignations
 To meet some day

 But now the Lords ain trumpet touts
 Till a the hills are rairin
 And echoes back return the shouts
 Black Russell is na sparin
 His piercin words like Highlan swords
 Divide the joints an marrow
 His talk o Hell whare devils dwell
 Our vera sauls does harrow
 Wi fright that day

 A vast unbottomd boundless pit
 Filld fou o lowin brunstane
 Whase raging flame an scorching heat
 Wad melt the hardest whunstane
 The halfasleep start up wi fear
 An think they hear it roarin
 When presently it does appear
 Twas but some neibor snorin
 Asleep that day

 Twad be owre lang a tale to tell
 How mony stories past
 An how they crouded to the yill
 When they were a dismist
 How drink gaed round in cogs an caups
 Amang the furms an benches
 An cheese an bread frae womens laps
 Was dealt about in lunches
 An dawds that day

 In comes a gawsie gash guidwife
 An sits down by the fire
 Syne draws her kebbuck an her knife
 The lasses they are shyer
 The auld guidmen about the grace
 Frae side to side they bother
 Till some ane by his bonnet lays
 An gies themt like a tether
 Fu lang that day

 Waesucks for him that gets nae lass
 Or lasses that hae naething
 Sma need has he to say a grace
 Or melvie his braw claithing
 O wives be mindfu ance yoursel
 How bonie lads ye wanted
 An dinna for a kebbuckheel
 Let lasses be affronted
 On sic a day

 Now Clinkumbell wi rattlin tow
 Begins to jow an croon
 Some swagger hame the best they dow
 Some wait the afternoon
 At slaps the billies halt a blink
 Till lasses strip their shoon
 Wi faith an hope an love an drink
 Theyre a in famous tune
 For crack that day

 How mony hearts this day converts
 O sinners and o lasses
 Their hearts o stane gin night are gane
 As saft as ony flesh is
 Theres some are fou o love divine
 Theres some are fou o brandy
 An mony jobs that day begin
 May end in houghmagandie
 Some ither day




Third Epistle To J Lapraik

 Guid speed and furder to you Johnie
 Guid health hale hans an weather bonie
 Now when yere nickin down fu cannie
 The staff o bread
 May ye neer want a stoup o brany
 To clear your head

 May Boreas never thresh your rigs
 Nor kick your rickles aff their legs
 Sendin the stuff oer muirs an haggs
 Like drivin wrack
 But may the tapmost grain that wags
 Come to the sack

 Im bizzie too an skelpin at it
 But bitter daudin showers hae wat it
 Sae my auld stumpie pen I gat it
 Wi muckle wark
 An took my jocteleg an whatt it
 Like ony clark

 Its now twa month that Im your debtor
 For your braw nameless dateless letter
 Abusin me for harsh illnature
 On holy men
 While deil a hair yoursel yere better
 But mair profane

 But let the kirkfolk ring their bells
 Lets sing about our noble sels
 Well cry nae jads frae heathen hills
 To help or roose us
 But browster wives an whisky stills
 They are the muses

 Your friendship Sir I winna quat it
 An if ye mak objections at it
 Then hand in neive some day well knot it
 An witness take
 An when wi usquabae weve wat it
 It winna break

 But if the beast an branks be spard
 Till kye be gaun without the herd
 And a the vittel in the yard
 An theekit right
 I mean your ingleside to guard
 Ae winter night

 Then museinspirin aquavitae
 Shall make us baith sae blythe and witty
 Till ye forget yere auld an gatty
 An be as canty
 As ye were nine years less than thretty
 Sweet ane an twenty

 But stooks are cowpit wi the blast
 And now the sinn keeks in the west
 Then I maun rin amang the rest
 An quat my chanter
 Sae I subscribe myself in haste
 Yours Rab the Ranter




Epistle To The Rev John Mmath

 Sept 13 1785

 Inclosing A Copy Of Holy Willies Prayer
 Which He Had Requested Sept 17 1785

 While at the stook the shearers cowr
 To shun the bitter blaudin showr
 Or in gulravage rinnin scowr
 To pass the time
 To you I dedicate the hour
 In idle rhyme

 My musie tird wi mony a sonnet
 On gown an ban an douse black bonnet
 Is grown right eerie now shes done it
 Lest they should blame her
 An rouse their holy thunder on it
 An anathem her

 I own twas rash an rather hardy
 That I a simple country bardie
 Should meddle wi a pack sae sturdy
 Wha if they ken me
 Can easy wi a single wordie
 Lowse hell upon me

 But I gae mad at their grimaces
 Their sighin cantin graceproud faces
 Their threemile prayers an halfmile graces
 Their raxin conscience
 Whase greed revenge an pride disgraces
 Waur nor their nonsense

 Theres Gawn miscad waur than a beast
 Wha has mair honour in his breast
 Than mony scores as guids the priest
 Wha sae abusd him
 And may a bard no crack his jest
 What way theyve usd him

 See him the poor mans friend in need
 The gentleman in word an deed
 An shall his fame an honour bleed
 By worthless skellums
 An not a muse erect her head
 To cowe the blellums

 O Pope had I thy satires darts
 To gie the rascals their deserts
 Id rip their rotten hollow hearts
 An tell aloud
 Their jugglin hocuspocus arts
 To cheat the crowd

 God knows Im no the thing I should be
 Nor am I even the thing I could be
 But twenty times I rather would be
 An atheist clean
 Than under gospel colours hid be
 Just for a screen

 An honest man may like a glass
 An honest man may like a lass
 But mean revenge an malice fause
 Hell still disdain
 An then cry zeal for gospel laws
 Like some we ken

 They take religion in their mouth
 They talk o mercy grace an truth
 For whatto gie their malice skouth
 On some puir wight
 An hunt him down owre right and ruth
 To ruin straight

 All hail Religion maid divine
 Pardon a muse sae mean as mine
 Who in her rough imperfect line
 Thus daurs to name thee
 To stigmatise false friends of thine
 Can neer defame thee

 Tho blotcht and foul wi mony a stain
 An far unworthy of thy train
 With trembling voice I tune my strain
 To join with those
 Who boldly dare thy cause maintain
 In spite of foes

 In spite o crowds in spite o mobs
 In spite o undermining jobs
 In spite o dark banditti stabs
 At worth an merit
 By scoundrels even wi holy robes
 But hellish spirit

 O Ayr my dear my native ground
 Within thy presbyterial bound
 A candid liberal band is found
 Of public teachers
 As men as Christians too renownd
 An manly preachers

 Sir in that circle you are namd
 Sir in that circle you are famd
 An some by whom your doctrines blamd
 Which gies you honour
 Even sir by them your hearts esteemd
 An winning manner

 Pardon this freedom I have taen
 An if impertinent Ive been
 Impute it not good Sir in ane
 Whase heart neer wrangd ye
 But to his utmost would befriend
 Ought that belangd ye




Second Epistle to Davie

 A Brother Poet

 Auld Neibour
 Im three times doubly oer your debtor
 For your auldfarrant frienly letter
 Tho I maun sayt I doubt ye flatter
 Ye speak sae fair
 For my puir silly rhymin clatter
 Some less maun sair

 Hale be your heart hale be your fiddle
 Lang may your elbuck jink diddle
 To cheer you thro the weary widdle
 O warly cares
 Till barins barins kindly cuddle
 Your auld grey hairs

 But Davie lad Im red yere glaikit
 Im tauld the muse ye hae negleckit
 An gif its sae ye sud by lickit
 Until ye fyke
 Sic hauns as you sud neer be faikit
 Be haint wha like

 For me Im on Parnassus brink
 Rivin the words to gar them clink
 Whiles dazed wi love whiles dazed wi drink
 Wi jads or masons
 An whiles but aye owre late I think
 Braw sober lessons

 Of a the thoughtless sons o man
 Commen to me the bardie clan
 Except it be some idle plan
 O rhymin clink
 The devil haetthat I sud ban
 They ever think

 Nae thought nae view nae scheme o livin
 Nae cares to gie us joy or grievin
 But just the pouchie put the neive in
 An while oughts there
 Then hiltie skiltie we gae scrievin
 An fash nae mair

 Leeze me on rhyme its aye a treasure
 My chief amaist my only pleasure
 At hame afiel at wark or leisure
 The Muse poor hizzie
 Tho rough an raploch be her measure
 Shes seldom lazy

 Haud to the Muse my daintie Davie
 The warl may play you mony a shavie
 But for the Muse shell never leave ye
 Tho eer sae puir
 Na even tho limpin wi the spavie
 Frae door tae door




SongYoung Peggy Blooms

 TuneLoch Erochside


 Young Peggy blooms our boniest lass
 Her blush is like the morning
 The rosy dawn the springing grass
 With early gems adorning
 Her eyes outshine the radiant beams
 That gild the passing shower
 And glitter oer the crystal streams
 And cheer each freshning flower

 Her lips more than the cherries bright
 A richer dye has graced them
 They charm th admiring gazers sight
 And sweetly tempt to taste them
 Her smile is as the evening mild
 When featherd pairs are courting
 And little lambkins wanton wild
 In playful bands disporting

 Were Fortune lovely Peggys foe
 Such sweetness would relent her
 As blooming spring unbends the brow
 Of surly savage Winter
 Detractions eye no aim can gain
 Her winning powrs to lessen
 And fretful Envy grins in vain
 The poisond tooth to fasten

 Ye Powrs of Honour Love and Truth
 From evry ill defend her
 Inspire the highlyfavourd youth
 The destinies intend her
 Still fan the sweet connubial flame
 Responsive in each bosom
 And bless the dear parental name
 With many a filial blossom




SongFarewell To Ballochmyle

 TuneMiss Forbes farewell to Banff


 The Catrine woods were yellow seen
 The flowers decayd on Catrine lee
 Nae lavrock sang on hillock green
 But nature sickend on the ee
 Thro faded groves Maria sang
 Hersel in beautys bloom the while
 And aye the wildwood ehoes rang
 Fareweel the braes o Ballochmyle

 Low in your wintry beds ye flowers
 Again yell flourish fresh and fair
 Ye birdies dumb in withring bowers
 Again yell charm the vocal air
 But here alas for me nae mair
 Shall birdie charm or floweret smile
 Fareweel the bonie banks of Ayr
 Fareweel fareweel sweet Ballochmyle




FragmentHer Flowing Locks

 Her flowing locks the ravens wing
 Adown her neck and bosom hing
 How sweet unto that breast to cling
 And round that neck entwine her

 Her lips are roses wat wi dew
 O what a feast her bonie mou
 Her cheeks a mair celestial hue
 A crimson still diviner




Halloween1

 Footnote 1 Is thought to be a night when witches devils
 and other mischiefmaking beings are abroad on their baneful
 midnight errands particularly those aerial people the
 fairies are said on that night to hold a grand
 anniversaryRB

The following poem will by many readers be well enough understood but
for the sake of those who are unacquainted with the manners and
traditions of the country where the scene is cast notes are added to
give some account of the principal charms and spells of that night so
big with prophecy to the peasantry in the west of Scotland The passion
of prying into futurity makes a striking part of the history of human
nature in its rude state in all ages and nations and it may be some
entertainment to a philosophic mind if any such honour the author with
a perusal to see the remains of it among the more unenlightened in our
ownRB

 Yes let the rich deride the proud disdain
 The simple pleasure of the lowly train
 To me more dear congenial to my heart
 One native charm than all the gloss of artGoldsmith

 Upon that night when fairies light
 On Cassilis Downans2 dance
 Or owre the lays in splendid blaze
 On sprightly coursers prance
 Or for Colean the rout is taen
 Beneath the moons pale beams
 There up the Cove3 to stray an rove
 Amang the rocks and streams
 To sport that night

 Footnote 2 Certain little romantic rocky green hills
 in the neighbourhood of the ancient seat of the Earls of
 CassilisRB

 Footnote 3 A noted cavern near Colean house called the
 Cove of Colean which as well as Cassilis Downans is
 famed in country story for being a favorite haunt of
 fairiesRB

 Amang the bonie winding banks
 Where Doon rins wimplin clear
 Where Bruce4 ance ruld the martial ranks
 An shook his Carrick spear
 Some merry friendly countrafolks
 Together did convene
 To burn their nits an pou their stocks
 An haud their Halloween
 Fu blythe that night

 Footnote 4 The famous family of that name the ancestors
 of Robert the great deliverer of his country were Earls of
 CarrickRB

 The lasses feat an cleanly neat
 Mair braw than when theyre fine
 Their faces blythe fu sweetly kythe
 Hearts leal an warm an kin
 The lads sae trig wi wooerbabs
 Weelknotted on their garten
 Some unco blate an some wi gabs
 Gar lasses hearts gang startin
 Whiles fast at night

 Then first an foremost thro the kail
 Their stocks5 maun a be sought ance

 Footnote 5 The first ceremony of Halloween is pulling each
 a stock or plant of kail They must go out hand in hand
 with eyes shut and pull the first they meet with its being
 big or little straight or crooked is prophetic of the size
 and shape of the grand object of all their spellsthe
 husband or wife If any yird or earth stick to the root
 that is tocher or fortune and the taste of the
 custock that is the heart of the stem is indicative of
 the natural temper and disposition Lastly the stems or
 to give them their ordinary appellation the runts are
 placed somewhere above the head of the door and the
 Christian names of the people whom chance brings into the
 house are according to the priority of placing the runts
 the names in questionR B

 They steek their een and grape an wale
 For muckle anes an straught anes
 Poor havrel Will fell aff the drift
 An wandered thro the bowkail
 An pout for want o better shift
 A runt was like a sowtail
 Sae bowt that night

 Then straught or crooked yird or nane
 They roar an cry a throuther
 The vera weethings toddlin rin
 Wi stocks out owre their shouther
 An gif the custocks sweet or sour
 Wi joctelegs they taste them
 Syne coziely aboon the door
 Wi cannie care theyve placd them
 To lie that night

 The lassies staw frae mang them a
 To pou their stalks o corn6
 But Rab slips out an jinks about
 Behint the muckle thorn
 He grippit Nelly hard and fast
 Loud skirld a the lasses
 But her tappickle maist was lost
 Whan kiutlin in the fausehouse7
 Wi him that night

 Footnote 6 They go to the barnyard and pull each at
 three different times a stalk of oats If the third stalk
 wants the toppickle that is the grain at the top of the
 stalk the party in question will come to the marriagebed
 anything but a maidRB

 Footnote 7 When the corn is in a doubtful state by being
 too green or wet the stackbuilder by means of old timber
 etc makes a large apartment in his stack with an opening
 in the side which is fairest exposed to the wind this he
 calls a fausehouseRB

 The auld guidwifes weelhoordit nits8
 Are round an round dividend
 An mony lads an lasses fates
 Are there that night decided
 Some kindle couthie side by side
 And burn thegither trimly
 Some start awa wi saucy pride
 An jump out owre the chimlie
 Fu high that night

 Footnote 8 Burning the nuts is a favorite charm They name
 the lad and lass to each particular nut as they lay them in
 the fire and according as they burn quietly together or
 start from beside one another the course and issue of the
 courtship will beRB

 Jean slips in twa wi tentie ee
 Wha twas she wadna tell
 But this is Jock an this is me
 She says in to hersel
 He bleezd owre her an she owre him
 As they wad never mair part
 Till fuff he started up the lum
 An Jean had een a sair heart
 To seet that night

 Poor Willie wi his bowkail runt
 Was brunt wi primsie Mallie
 An Mary nae doubt took the drunt
 To be compard to Willie
 Malls nit lap out wi pridefu fling
 An her ain fit it brunt it
 While Willie lap and swore by jing
 Twas just the way he wanted
 To be that night

 Nell had the fausehouse in her min
 She pits hersel an Rob in
 In loving bleeze they sweetly join
 Till white in ase theyre sobbin
 Nells heart was dancin at the view
 She whisperd Rob to leuk fort
 Rob stownlins pried her bonie mou
 Fu cozie in the neuk fort
 Unseen that night

 But Merran sat behint their backs
 Her thoughts on Andrew Bell
 She leaes them gashin at their cracks
 An slips outby hersel
 She thro the yard the nearest taks
 An for the kiln she goes then
 An darklins grapit for the bauks
 And in the blueclue9 throws then
 Right feart that night

 Footnote 9 Whoever would with success try this spell
 must strictly observe these directions Steal out all
 alone to the kiln and darkling throw into the pot a
 clue of blue yarn wind it in a new clue off the old one
 and toward the latter end something will hold the thread
 demand Wha hauds ie who holds and answer will be
 returned from the kilnpot by naming the Christian and
 surname of your future spouseRB

 An ay she wint an ay she swat
 I wat she made nae jaukin
 Till something held within the pat
 Good Lord but she was quaukin
 But whether twas the deil himsel
 Or whether twas a bauken
 Or whether it was Andrew Bell
 She did na wait on talkin
 To spier that night

 Wee Jenny to her graunie says
 Will ye go wi me graunie
 Ill eat the apple at the glass10
 I gat frae uncle Johnie
 She fufft her pipe wi sic a lunt
 In wrath she was sae vaprin
 She notict na an aizle brunt
 Her braw new worset apron
 Out thro that night

 Footnote 10 Take a candle and go alone to a lookingglass
 eat an apple before it and some traditions say you should
 comb your hair all the time the face of your conjungal
 companion to be will be seen in the glass as if peeping
 over your shoulderRB

 Ye little skelpielimmers face
 I daur you try sic sportin
 As seek the foul thief ony place
 For him to spae your fortune
 Nae doubt but ye may get a sight
 Great cause ye hae to fear it
 For mony a ane has gotten a fright
 An livd an died deleerit
 On sic a night

 Ae hairst afore the Sherramoor
 I mindt as weels yestreen
 I was a gilpey then Im sure
 I was na past fyfteen
 The simmer had been cauld an wat
 An stuff was unco green
 An eye a rantin kirn we gat
 An just on Halloween
 It fell that night

 Our stibblerig was Rab MGraen
 A clever sturdy fallow
 His sin gat Eppie Sim wi wean
 That lived in Achmacalla
 He gat hempseed11 I mind it weel
 Anhe made unco light ot
 But mony a day was by himsel
 He was sae sairly frighted
 That vera night

 Footnote 11 Steal out unperceived and sow a handful of
 hempseed harrowing it with anything you can conveniently
 draw after you Repeat now and then Hempseed I saw thee
 hempseed I saw thee and him or her that is to be my
 true love come after me and pou thee Look over your left
 shoulder and you will see the appearance of the person
 invoked in the attitude of pulling hemp Some traditions
 say Come after me and shaw thee that is show thyself
 in which case it simply appears Others omit the harrowing
 and say Come after me and harrow theeRB

 Then up gat fechtin Jamie Fleck
 An he swoor by his conscience
 That he could saw hempseed a peck
 For it was a but nonsense
 The auld guidman raught down the pock
 An out a handfu gied him
 Syne bad him slip frae mang the folk
 Sometime when nae ane seed him
 An tryt that night

 He marches thro amang the stacks
 Tho he was something sturtin
 The graip he for a harrow taks
 An haurls at his curpin
 And evry now an then he says
 Hempseed I saw thee
 An her that is to be my lass
 Come after me an draw thee
 As fast this night

 He wistld up Lord Lennox March
 To keep his courage cherry
 Altho his hair began to arch
 He was sae fleyd an eerie
 Till presently he hears a squeak
 An then a grane an gruntle
 He by his shouther gae a keek
 An tumbled wi a wintle
 Outowre that night

 He roard a horrid murdershout
 In dreadfu desperation
 An young an auld come rinnin out
 An hear the sad narration
 He swoor twas hilchin Jean MCraw
 Or crouchie Merran Humphie
 Till stop she trotted thro them a
 And wha was it but grumphie
 Asteer that night

 Meg fain wad to the barn gaen
 To winn three wechts o naething12
 But for to meet the deil her lane
 She pat but little faith in

 Footnote 12 This charm must likewise be performed
 unperceived and alone You go to the barn and open both
 doors taking them off the hinges if possible for there is
 danger that the being about to appear may shut the doors
 and do you some mischief Then take that instrument used in
 winnowing the corn which in our country dialect we call a
 wecht and go through all the attitudes of letting down
 corn against the wind Repeat it three times and the third
 time an apparition will pass through the barn in at the
 windy door and out at the other having both the figure in
 question and the appearance or retinue marking the
 employment or station in lifeRB

 She gies the herd a pickle nits
 An twa red cheekit apples
 To watch while for the barn she sets
 In hopes to see Tam Kipples
 That vera night

 She turns the key wi cannie thraw
 Anowre the threshold ventures
 But first on Sawnie gies a ca
 Syne baudly in she enters
 A ratton rattld up the wa
 An she cryd Lord preserve her
 An ran thro middenhole an a
 An prayd wi zeal and fervour
 Fu fast that night

 They hoyt out Will wi sair advice
 They hecht him some fine braw ane
 It chancd the stack he faddomt thrice13
 Was timmerpropt for thrawin
 He taks a swirlie auld mossoak
 For some black grousome carlin
 An loot a winze an drew a stroke
 Till skin in blypes cam haurlin
 Affs nieves that night

 Footnote 13 Take an opportunity of going unnoticed to a
 bearstack and fathom it three times round The last
 fathom of the last time you will catch in your arms the
 appearance of your future conjugal yokefellowRB

 A wanton widow Leezie was
 As cantie as a kittlen
 But och that night amang the shaws
 She gat a fearfu settlin
 She thro the whins an by the cairn
 An owre the hill gaed scrievin
 Whare three lairds lans met at a burn14
 To dip her left sarksleeve in
 Was bent that night

 Footnote 14 You go out one or more for this is a social
 spell to a south running spring or rivulet where three
 lairds lands meet and dip your left shirt sleeve Go to
 bed in sight of a fire and hang your wet sleeve before it
 to dry Lie awake and some time near midnight an
 apparition having the exact figure of the grand object in
 question will come and turn the sleeve as if to dry the
 other side of itRB

 Whiles owre a linn the burnie plays
 As thro the glen it wimplt
 Whiles round a rocky scar it strays
 Whiles in a wiel it dimplt
 Whiles glitterd to the nightly rays
 Wi bickerin dancin dazzle
 Whiles cookit undeneath the braes
 Below the spreading hazel
 Unseen that night

 Amang the brachens on the brae
 Between her an the moon
 The deil or else an outler quey
 Gat up an gae a croon
 Poor Leezies heart maist lap the hool
 Near lavrockheight she jumpit
 But mist a fit an in the pool
 Outowre the lugs she plumpit
 Wi a plunge that night

 In order on the clean hearthstane
 The luggies15 three are ranged
 An evry time great care is taen
 To see them duly changed
 Auld uncle John wha wedlocks joys
 Sin Marsyear did desire
 Because he gat the toom dish thrice
 He heavd them on the fire
 In wrath that night

 Footnote 15 Take three dishes put clean water in one
 foul water in another and leave the third empty blindfold
 a person and lead him to the hearth where the dishes are
 ranged he or she dips the left hand if by chance in the
 clean water the future husband or wife will come to the
 bar of matrimony a maid if in the foul a widow if in the
 empty dish it foretells with equal certainty no marriage
 at all It is repeated three times and every time the
 arrangement of the dishes is alteredRB

 Wi merry sangs an friendly cracks
 I wat they did na weary
 And unco tales an funnie jokes
 Their sports were cheap an cheery
 Till butterd sowens16 wi fragrant lunt

 Footnote 16 Sowens with butter instead of milk to them
 is always the Halloween SupperRB

 Set a their gabs asteerin
 Syne wi a social glass o strunt
 They parted aff careerin
 Fu blythe that night




To A Mouse On Turning Her Up In Her Nest With The Plough November 1785

 Wee sleekit cowrin timrous beastie
 O what a panics in thy breastie
 Thou need na start awa sae hasty
 Wi bickering brattle
 I wad be laith to rin an chase thee
 Wi murdring pattle

 Im truly sorry mans dominion
 Has broken natures social union
 An justifies that ill opinion
 Which makes thee startle
 At me thy poor earthborn companion
 An fellowmortal

 I doubt na whiles but thou may thieve
 What then poor beastie thou maun live
 A daimen icker in a thrave
 S a sma request
 Ill get a blessin wi the lave
 An never misst

 Thy wee bit housie too in ruin
 Its silly was the wins are strewin
 An naething now to big a new ane
 O foggage green
 An bleak Decembers winds ensuin
 Baith snell an keen

 Thou saw the fields laid bare an waste
 An weary winter comin fast
 An cozie here beneath the blast
 Thou thought to dwell
 Till crash the cruel coulter past
 Out thro thy cell

 That wee bit heap o leaves an stibble
 Has cost thee mony a weary nibble
 Now thous turnd out for a thy trouble
 But house or hald
 To thole the winters sleety dribble
 An cranreuch cauld

 But Mousie thou art no thy lane
 In proving foresight may be vain
 The bestlaid schemes o mice an men
 Gang aft agley
 Anleae us nought but grief an pain
 For promisd joy

 Still thou art blest compard wi me
 The present only toucheth thee
 But Och I backward cast my ee
 On prospects drear
 An forward tho I canna see
 I guess an fear




Epitaph On John Dove Innkeeper

 Here lies Johnie Pigeon
 What was his religion
 Whaeer desires to ken
 To some other warl
 Maun follow the carl
 For here Johnie Pigeon had nane

 Strong ale was ablution
 Small beer persecution
 A dram was memento mori
 But a fullflowing bowl
 Was the saving his soul
 And port was celestial glory




Epitaph For James Smith

 Lament him Mauchline husbands a
 He aften did assist ye
 For had ye staid hale weeks awa
 Your wives they neer had missd ye

 Ye Mauchline bairns as on ye press
 To school in bands thegither
 O tread ye lightly on his grass
 Perhaps he was your father




Adam Armours Prayer

 Gude pity me because Im little
 For though I am an elf o mettle
 An can like ony wabsters shuttle
 Jink there or here
 Yet scarce as langs a gude kailwhittle
 Im unco queer

 An now Thou kens our waefu case
 For Geordies jurr were in disgrace
 Because we stangd her through the place
 An hurt her spleuchan
 For whilk we daurna show our face
 Within the clachan

 An now were dernd in dens and hollows
 And hunted as was William Wallace
 Wi constablesthae blackguard fallows
 An sodgers baith
 But Gude preserve us frae the gallows
 That shamefu death

 Auld grim blackbearded Geordies sel
 O shake him owre the mouth o hell
 There let him hing an roar an yell
 Wi hideous din
 And if he offers to rebel
 Then heave him in

 When Death comes in wi glimmerin blink
 An tips auld drucken Nanse the wink
 May Sautan gie her doup a clink
 Within his yett
 An fill her up wi brimstone drink
 Redreekin het

 Though Jock an havrel Jean are merry
 Some devil seize them in a hurry
 An waft them in th infernal wherry
 Straught through the lake
 An gie their hides a noble curry

 When lyart leaves bestrow the yird
 Or wavering like the bauckiebird
 Bedim cauld Boreas blast
 When hailstanes drive wi bitter skyte
 And infant frosts begin to bite
 In hoary cranreuch drest
 Ae night at een a merry core
 O randie gangrel bodies
 In PoosieNansies held the splore
 To drink their orra duddies
 Wi quaffing an laughing
 They ranted an they sang
 Wi jumping an thumping
 The vera girdle rang

 First neist the fire in auld red rags
 Ane sat weel bracd wi mealy bags

 And knapsack a in order
 His doxy lay within his arm
 Wi usquebae an blankets warm
 She blinkit on her sodger
 An aye he gies the tozie drab
 The tither skelpin kiss
 While she held up her greedy gab
 Just like an aumous dish
 Ilk smack still did crack still
 Just like a cadgers whip
 Then staggering an swaggering
 He roard this ditty up

 TuneSoldiers Joy


 I am a son of Mars who have been in many wars
 And show my cuts and scars wherever I come
 This here was for a wench and that other in a trench
 When welcoming the French at the sound of the drum
 Lal de daudle c

 My prenticeship I past where my leader breathd his last
 When the bloody die was cast on the heights of Abram
 and I served out my trade when the gallant game was playd
 And the Morro low was laid at the sound of the drum

 I lastly was with Curtis among the floating battries
 And there I left for witness an arm and a limb
 Yet let my country need me with Elliot to head me
 Id clatter on my stumps at the sound of a drum

 And now tho I must beg with a wooden arm and leg
 And many a tatterd rag hanging over my bum
 Im as happy with my wallet my bottle and my callet
 As when I used in scarlet to follow a drum

 What tho with hoary locks I must stand the winter shocks
 Beneath the woods and rocks oftentimes for a home
 When the tother bag I sell and the tother bottle tell
 I could meet a troop of hell at the sound of a drum

 TuneSodger Laddie


 I once was a maid tho I cannot tell when
 And still my delight is in proper young men
 Some one of a troop of dragoons was my daddie
 No wonder Im fond of a sodger laddie
 Sing lal de lal c

 The first of my loves was a swaggering blade
 To rattle the thundering drum was his trade
 His leg was so tight and his cheek was so ruddy
 Transported I was with my sodger laddie

 But the godly old chaplain left him in the lurch
 The sword I forsook for the sake of the church
 He venturd the soul and I risked the body
 Twas then I proved false to my sodger laddie

 Full soon I grew sick of my sanctified sot
 The regiment at large for a husband I got
 From the gilded spontoon to the fife I was ready
 I asked no more but a sodger laddie

 But the peace it reducd me to beg in despair
 Till I met old boy in a Cunningham fair
 His rags regimental they flutterd so gaudy
 My heart it rejoicd at a sodger laddie

 And now I have livdI know not how long
 And still I can join in a cup and a song
 But whilst with both hands I can hold the glass steady
 Heres to thee my hero my sodger laddie

 But what will ye hae of a fool

 For drink I would venture my neck
 A hizzies the half of my craft
 But what could ye other expect
 Of ane thats avowedly daft

 For civilly swearing and quaffin

 For towsing a lass i my daffin

The Cotters Saturday Night

 Inscribed to R Aiken Esq of Ayr

 Let not Ambition mock their useful toil
 Their homely joys and destiny obscure
 Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
 The short and simple annals of the Poor
 Gray

 My lovd my honourd much respected friend
 No mercenary bard his homage pays
 With honest pride I scorn each selfish end
 My dearest meed a friends esteem and praise
 To you I sing in simple Scottish lays
 The lowly train in lifes sequesterd scene
 The native feelings strong the guileless ways
 What Aiken in a cottage would have been
 Ah tho his worth unknown far happier there I ween

 November chill blaws loud wi angry sugh
 The shortning winterday is near a close
 The miry beasts retreating frae the pleugh
 The blackning trains o craws to their repose
 The toilworn Cotter frae his labour goes
 This night his weekly moil is at an end
 Collects his spades his mattocks and his hoes
 Hoping the morn in ease and rest to spend
 And weary oer the moor his course does hameward bend

 At length his lonely cot appears in view
 Beneath the shelter of an aged tree
 Th expectant weethings toddlin stacher through
 To meet their dead wi flichterin noise and glee
 His wee bit ingle blinkin bonilie
 His clean hearthstane his thrifty wifies smile
 The lisping infant prattling on his knee
 Does a his weary kiaugh and care beguile
 And makes him quite forget his labour and his toil

 Belyve the elder bairns come drapping in
 At service out amang the farmers roun
 Some ca the pleugh some herd some tentie rin
 A cannie errand to a neibor town
 Their eldest hope their Jenny womangrown
 In youthfu bloomlove sparkling in her ee
 Comes hame perhaps to shew a braw new gown
 Or deposite her sairwon pennyfee
 To help her parents dear if they in hardship be

 With joy unfeignd brothers and sisters meet
 And each for others weelfare kindly speirs
 The social hours swiftwingd unnoticd fleet
 Each tells the uncos that he sees or hears
 The parents partial eye their hopeful years
 Anticipation forward points the view
 The mother wi her needle and her shears
 Gars auld claes look amaist as weels the new
 The father mixes a wi admonition due

 Their masters and their mistress command
 The younkers a are warned to obey
 And mind their labours wi an eydent hand
 And neer tho out o sight to jauk or play
 And O be sure to fear the Lord alway
 And mind your duty duly morn and night
 Lest in temptations path ye gang astray
 Implore His counsel and assisting might
 They never sought in vain that sought the Lord aright

 But hark a rap comes gently to the door
 Jenny wha kens the meaning o the same
 Tells how a neibor lad came oer the moor
 To do some errands and convoy her hame
 The wily mother sees the conscious flame
 Sparkle in Jennys ee and flush her cheek
 With heartstruck anxious care enquires his name
 While Jenny hafflins is afraid to speak
 Weelpleased the mother hears its nae wild worthless rake

 Wi kindly welcome Jenny brings him ben
 A strappin youth he takes the mothers eye
 Blythe Jenny sees the visits no ill taen
 The father cracks of horses pleughs and kye
 The youngsters artless heart oerflows wi joy
 But blate an laithfu scarce can weel behave
 The mother wi a womans wiles can spy
 What makes the youth sae bashfu and sae grave
 Weelpleasd to think her bairns respected like the lave

 O happy love where love like this is found
 O heartfelt raptures bliss beyond compare
 Ive paced much this weary mortal round
 And sage experience bids me this declare
 If Heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare
 One cordial in this melancholy vale
 Tis when a youthful loving modest pair
 In othersarms breathe out the tender tale
 Beneath the milkwhite thorn that scents the evening gale

 Is there in human form that bears a heart
 A wretch a villain lost to love and truth
 That can with studied sly ensnaring art
 Betray sweet Jennys unsuspecting youth
 Curse on his perjurd arts dissembling smooth
 Are honour virtue conscience all exild
 Is there no pity no relenting ruth
 Points to the parents fondling oer their child
 Then paints the ruind maid and their distraction wild

 But now the supper crowns their simple board
 The halesome parritch chief of Scotias food
 The sowp their only hawkie does afford
 That yont the hallan snugly chows her cood
 The dame brings forth in complimental mood
 To grace the lad her weelhaind kebbuck fell
 And aft hes prest and aft he cas it guid
 The frugal wifie garrulous will tell
 How twas a towmond auld sin lint was i the bell

 The cheerfu supper done wi serious face
 They round the ingle form a circle wide
 The sire turns oer with patriarchal grace
 The big habible ance his fathers pride
 His bonnet revrently is laid aside
 His lyart haffets wearing thin and bare
 Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide
 He wales a portion with judicious care
 And Let us worship God he says with solemn air

 They chant their artless notes in simple guise
 They tune their hearts by far the noblest aim
 Perhaps Dundees wildwarbling measures rise
 Or plaintive Martyrs worthy of the name
 Or noble Elgin beets the heavenward flame
 The sweetest far of Scotias holy lays
 Compard with these Italian trills are tame
 The tickld ears no heartfelt raptures raise
 Nae unison hae they with our Creators praise

 The priestlike father reads the sacred page
 How Abram was the friend of God on high
 Or Moses bade eternal warfare wage
 With Amaleks ungracious progeny
 Or how the royal bard did groaning lie
 Beneath the stroke of Heavens avenging ire
 Or Jobs pathetic plaint and wailing cry
 Or rapt Isaiahs wild seraphic fire
 Or other holy seers that tune the sacred lyre

 Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme
 How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed
 How He who bore in Heaven the second name
 Had not on earth whereon to lay His head
 How His first followers and servants sped
 The precepts sage they wrote to many a land
 How he who lone in Patmos banished
 Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand
 And heard great Bablons doom pronouncd by Heavens command

 Then kneeling down to Heavens Eternal King
 The saint the father and the husband prays
 Hope springs exulting on triumphant wing1
 That thus they all shall meet in future days
 There ever bask in uncreated rays
 No more to sigh or shed the bitter tear
 Together hymning their Creators praise
 In such society yet still more dear
 While circling Time moves round in an eternal sphere

 Compard with this how poor Religions pride
 In all the pomp of method and of art
 When men display to congregations wide

 Footnote 1 Popes Windsor ForestRB

 Devotions evry grace except the heart
 The Power incensd the pageant will desert
 The pompous strain the sacerdotal stole
 But haply in some cottage far apart
 May hear wellpleasd the language of the soul
 And in His Book of Life the inmates poor enroll

 Then homeward all take off their sevral way
 The youngling cottagers retire to rest
 The parentpair their secret homage pay
 And proffer up to Heaven the warm request
 That he who stills the ravens clamrous nest
 And decks the lily fair in flowry pride
 Would in the way His wisdom sees the best
 For them and for their little ones provide
 But chiefly in their hearts with grace divine preside

 From scenes like these old Scotias grandeur springs
 That makes her lovd at home reverd abroad
 Princes and lords are but the breath of kings
 An honest mans the noblest work of God
 And certes in fair virtues heavenly road
 The cottage leaves the palace far behind
 What is a lordlings pomp a cumbrous load
 Disguising oft the wretch of human kind
 Studied in arts of hell in wickedness refind

 O Scotia my dear my native soil
 For whom my warmest wish to Heaven is sent
 Long may thy hardy sons of rustic toil
 Be blest with health and peace and sweet content
 And O may Heaven their simple lives prevent
 From luxurys contagion weak and vile
 Then howeer crowns and coronets be rent
 A virtuous populace may rise the while
 And stand a wall of fire around their muchlovd isle

 O Thou who pourd the patriotic tide
 That streamd thro Wallaces undaunted heart
 Who dard to nobly stem tyrannic pride
 Or nobly die the second glorious part
 The patriots God peculiarly thou art
 His friend inspirer guardian and reward
 O never never Scotias realm desert
 But still the patriot and the patriotbard
 In bright succession raise her ornament and guard

 Hear me auld Hangie for a wee

 To skelp an scaud poor dogs like me

 Great is thy powr an great thy fame
 Far kend an noted is thy name
 An tho yon lowin heuchs thy hame

 Whiles ranging like a roarin lion
 For prey a holes and corners tryin
 Whiles on the strongwindd tempest flyin
 Tirlin the kirks
 Whiles in the human bosom pryin
 Unseen thou lurks

 Ive heard my revrend graunie say
 In lanely glens ye like to stray
 Or where auld ruind castles grey
 Nod to the moon
 Ye fright the nightly wandrers way
 Wi eldritch croon

 When twilight did my graunie summon
 To say her prayrs douse honest woman
 Aftyont the dyke shes heard you bummin
 Wi eerie drone
 Or rustlin thro the boortrees comin
 Wi heavy groan

 Ae dreary windy winter night
 The stars shot down wi sklentin light
 Wi you mysel I gat a fright
 Ayont the lough
 Ye like a rashbuss stood in sight
 Wi wavin sough

 The cudgel in my nieve did shake
 Each bristld hair stood like a stake
 When wi an eldritch stoor quaick quaick
 Amang the springs
 Awa ye squatterd like a drake
 On whistlin wings

 Let warlocks grim an witherd hags
 Tell how wi you on ragweed nags
 They skim the muirs an dizzy crags
 Wi wicked speed
 And in kirkyards renew their leagues
 Owre howkit dead

 Thence countra wives wi toil and pain
 May plunge an plunge the kirn in vain
 For oh the yellow treasures taen
 By witchin skill
 An dawtit twalpint hawkies gane
 As yells the bill

 Thence mystic knots mak great abuse
 On young guidmen fond keen an crouse
 When the best warklume i the house
 By cantrip wit
 Is instant made no worth a louse
 Just at the bit

 When thowes dissolve the snawy hoord
 An float the jinglin icy boord
 Then waterkelpies haunt the foord
 By your direction
 And nighted travllers are allurd
 To their destruction

 And aft your mosstraversin Spunkies
 Decoy the wight that late an drunk is
 The bleezin curst mischievous monkies
 Delude his eyes
 Till in some miry slough he sunk is
 Neer mair to rise

 When masons mystic word an grip
 In storms an tempests raise you up
 Some cock or cat your rage maun stop
 Or strange to tell
 The youngest brither ye wad whip
 Aff straught to hell

 Lang syne in Edens bonie yard
 When youthfu lovers first were paird
 An all the soul of love they shard
 The rapturd hour
 Sweet on the fragrant flowry swaird
 In shady bower1

 Then you ye auld snickdrawing dog
 Ye cam to Paradise incog

 While scabs and botches did him gall

 Yet humbly kind in time o need

 Thou art the life o public haunts
 But thee what were our fairs and rants
 Evn godly meetings o the saunts

 When gaping they besiege the tents
 Are doubly fird

 That merry night we get the corn in
 O sweetly then thou reams the horn in
 Or reekin on a Newyear mornin

 When Vulcan gies his bellows breath
 An ploughmen gather wi their graith
 O rare to see thee fizz an freath

 Then Burnewin comes on like death
 At every chap

 Nae mercy then for airn or steel
 The brawnie banie ploughman chiel
 Brings hard owrehip wi sturdy wheel
 The strong forehammer
 Till block an studdie ring an reel
 Wi dinsome clamour

 When skirling weanies see the light
 Though maks the gossips clatter bright
 How fumblin cuiffs their dearies slight
 Wae worth the name
 Nae howdie gets a social night
 Or plack frae them

 When neibors anger at a plea
 An just as wud as wud can be
 How easy can the barley brie
 Cement the quarrel
 Its aye the cheapest lawyers fee
 To taste the barrel

 Alake that eer my muse has reason
 To wyte her countrymen wi treason
 But mony daily weet their weason
 Wi liquors nice
 An hardly in a winter season

 Wae worth that brandy burnin trash
 Fell source o mony a pain an brash
 Twins mony a poor doylt drucken hash
 O half his days
 An sends beside auld Scotlands cash
 To her warst faes

 Ye Scots wha wish auld Scotland well
 Ye chief to you my tale I tell
 Poor plackless devils like mysel
 It sets you ill
 Wi bitter dearthfu wines to mell
 Or foreign gill

 May gravels round his blather wrench
 An gouts torment him inch by inch
 What twists his gruntle wi a glunch
 O sour disdain
 Out owre a glass o whiskypunch
 Wi honest men

 O Whisky soul o plays and pranks
 Accept a bardies gratfu thanks
 When wanting thee what tuneless cranks
 Are my poor verses
 Thou comesthey rattle in their ranks
 At ithers as

 Thee Ferintosh O sadly lost
 Scotland lament frae coast to coast
 Now colic grips an barkin hoast
 May kill us a
 For loyal Forbes charterd boast
 Is taen awa

 Thae curst horseleeches o the Excise
 Wha mak the whisky stells their prize
 Haud up thy han Deil ance twice thrice
 There seize the blinkers
 An bake them up in brunstane pies
 For poor damnd drinkers

 Fortune if thoull but gie me still
 Hale breeks a scone an whisky gill
 An rowth o rhyme to rave at will
 Tak a the rest
 An dealt about as thy blind skill
 Directs thee best

The Auld Farmers NewYearMorning Salutation To His Auld Mare Maggie

 On giving her the accustomed ripp of corn to hansel in the New Year

 A Guid Newyear I wish thee Maggie
 Hae theres a ripp to thy auld baggie
 Tho thous howebackit now an knaggie
 Ive seen the day
 Thou could hae gaen like ony staggie
 Outowre the lay

 Tho now thous dowie stiff an crazy
 An thy auld hide as whites a daisie
 Ive seen thee dapplt sleek an glaizie
 A bonie gray
 He should been tight that daurt to raize thee
 Ance in a day

 Thou ance was i the foremost rank
 A filly buirdly steeve an swank
 An set weel down a shapely shank
 As eer tread yird
 An could hae flown outowre a stank
 Like ony bird

 Its now some nineantwenty year
 Sin thou was my guidfathers mear
 He gied me thee o tocher clear
 An fifty mark
 Tho it was sma twas weelwon gear
 An thou was stark

 When first I gaed to woo my Jenny
 Ye then was trotting wi your minnie
 Tho ye was trickie slee an funnie
 Ye neer was donsie
 But hamely tawie quiet an cannie
 An unco sonsie

 That day ye prancd wi muckle pride
 When ye bure hame my bonie bride
 An sweet an gracefu she did ride
 Wi maiden air
 KyleStewart I could bragged wide
 For sic a pair

 Tho now ye dow but hoyte and hobble
 An wintle like a saumont coble
 That day ye was a jinker noble
 For heels an win
 An ran them till they a did wauble
 Far far behin

 When thou an I were young an skeigh
 An stablemeals at fairs were dreigh
 How thou wad prance and snore an skreigh
 An tak the road
 Townsbodies ran an stood abeigh
 An cat thee mad

 When thou was cornt an I was mellow
 We took the road aye like a swallow
 At brooses thou had neer a fellow
 For pith an speed
 But evry tail thou payt them hollowm
 Whareer thou gaed

 The sma drooprumplt hunter cattle
 Might aiblins waurt thee for a brattle
 But sax Scotch mile thou tryt their mettle
 An gart them whaizle
 Nae whip nor spur but just a wattle
 O saugh or hazel

 Thou was a noble fittielan
 As eer in tug or tow was drawn
 Aft thee an I in aught hours gaun
 In guid Marchweather
 Hae turnd sax rood beside our han
 For days thegither

 Thou never braingt an fetcht an fliskit
 But thy auld tail thou wad hae whiskit
 An spread abreed thy weelfilld brisket
 Wi pith an power
 Till sprittie knowes wad rairt an riskit
 An slypet owre

 When frosts lay lang an snaws were deep
 An threatend labour back to keep
 I gied thy cog a wee bit heap
 Aboon the timmer
 I kend my Maggie wad na sleep
 For that or simmer

 In cart or car thou never reestit
 The steyest brae thou wad hae fact it
 Thou never lap an stent and breastit
 Then stood to blaw
 But just thy step a wee thing hastit
 Thou snoovt awa

 My pleugh is now thy bairntime a
 Four gallant brutes as eer did draw
 Forbye sax mae Ive sellt awa
 That thou hast nurst
 They drew me thretteen pund an twa
 The vera warst

 Mony a sair daurk we twa hae wrought
 An wi the weary warl fought
 An mony an anxious day I thought
 We wad be beat
 Yet here to crazy age were brought
 Wi something yet

 An think na my auld trusty servan
 That now perhaps thous less deservin
 An thy auld days may end in starvin
 For my last fow
 A heapit stimpart Ill reserve ane
 Laid by for you

 Weve worn to crazy years thegither
 Well toyte about wi ane anither
 Wi tentie care Ill flit thy tether
 To some haind rig
 Whare ye may nobly rax your leather
 Wi sma fatigue




The Twa Dogs1

 A Tale

 Twas in that place o Scotlands isle
 That bears the name o auld King Coil
 Upon a bonie day in June
 When wearin thro the afternoon
 Twa dogs that were na thrang at hame
 Forgatherd ance upon a time

 The first Ill name they cad him Caesar
 Was keepit for His Honors pleasure
 His hair his size his mouth his lugs
 Shewd he was nane o Scotlands dogs
 But whalpit some place far abroad
 Whare sailors gang to fish for cod

 His locked letterd braw brass collar
 Shewd him the gentleman an scholar
 But though he was o high degree
 The fient a pride nae pride had he
 But wad hae spent an hour caressin
 Evn wi al tinklergipsys messin
 At kirk or market mill or smiddie
 Nae tawted tyke tho eer sae duddie
 But he wad stant as glad to see him
 An stroant on stanes an hillocks wi him

 The tither was a ploughmans collie
 A rhyming ranting raving billie
 Wha for his friend an comrade had him
 And in freak had Luath cad him
 After some dog in Highland Sang2
 Was made lang syneLord knows how lang

 He was a gash an faithfu tyke
 As ever lap a sheugh or dyke
 His honest sonsie bawsnt face
 Aye gat him friends in ilka place
 His breast was white his touzie back
 Weel clad wi coat o glossy black
 His gawsie tail wi upward curl
 Hung owre his hurdies wi a swirl

 Footnote 1 Luath was Burns own dog

 Footnote 2 Luath Cuchullins dog in Ossians FingalR B

 Nae doubt but they were fain o ither
 And unco pack an thick thegither
 Wi social nose whiles snuffd an snowkit
 Whiles mice an moudieworts they howkit
 Whiles scourd awa in lang excursion
 An worryd ither in diversion
 Until wi daffin weary grown
 Upon a knowe they set them down
 An there began a lang digression
 About the lords o the creation




 Caesar

 Ive aften wonderd honest Luath
 What sort o life poor dogs like you have
 An when the gentrys life I saw
 What way poor bodies livd ava

 Our laird gets in his racked rents
 His coals his kane an a his stents
 He rises when he likes himsel
 His flunkies answer at the bell
 He cas his coach he cas his horse
 He draws a bonie silken purse
 As langs my tail where thro the steeks
 The yellow letterd Geordie keeks

 Frae morn to een its nought but toiling
 At baking roasting frying boiling
 An tho the gentry first are stechin
 Yet evn the ha folk fill their pechan
 Wi sauce ragouts an sic like trashtrie
 Thats little short o downright wastrie
 Our whipperin wee blasted wonner
 Poor worthless elf it eats a dinner
 Better than ony tenantman
 His Honour has in a the lan
 An what poor cotfolk pit their painch in
 I own its past my comprehension




 Luath

 Trowth Caesar whiles theyre fasht eneugh
 A cottar howkin in a sheugh
 Wi dirty stanes biggin a dyke
 Baring a quarry an sic like
 Himsel a wife he thus sustains
 A smytrie o wee duddie weans
 An nought but his handaurk to keep
 Them right an tight in thack an rape

 An when they meet wi sair disasters
 Like loss o health or want o masters
 Ye maist wad think a wee touch langer
 An they maun starve o cauld an hunger
 But how it comes I never kent yet
 Theyre maistly wonderfu contented
 An buirdly chiels an clever hizzies
 Are bred in sic a way as this is




 Caesar

 But then to see how yere negleckit
 How huffd an cuffd an disrespeckit
 Lord man our gentry care as little
 For delvers ditchers an sic cattle
 They gang as saucy by poor folk
 As I wad by a stinkin brock

 Ive noticd on our lairds courtday
 An mony a time my hearts been wae
 Poor tenant bodies scant ocash
 How they maun thole a factors snash
 Hell stamp an threaten curse an swear
 Hell apprehend them poind their gear
 While they maun stan wi aspect humble
 An hear it a an fear an tremble

 I see how folk live that hae riches
 But surely poorfolk maun be wretches




 Luath

 Theyre no sae wretcheds ane wad think
 Tho constantly on poortiths brink
 Theyre sae accustomd wi the sight
 The view ot gives them little fright

 Then chance and fortune are sae guided
 Theyre aye in less or mair provided
 An tho fatigued wi close employment
 A blink o rests a sweet enjoyment

 The dearest comfort o their lives
 Their grushie weans an faithfu wives
 The prattling things are just their pride
 That sweetens a their fireside

 An whiles twalpennie worth o nappy
 Can mak the bodies unco happy
 They lay aside their private cares
 To mind the Kirk and State affairs
 Theyll talk o patronage an priests
 Wi kindling fury i their breasts
 Or tell what new taxations comin
 An ferlie at the folk in Lonon

 As bleakfacd Hallowmass returns
 They get the jovial rantin kirns
 When rural life of evry station
 Unite in common recreation
 Love blinks Wit slaps an social Mirth
 Forgets theres Care upo the earth

 That merry day the year begins
 They bar the door on frosty wins
 The nappy reeks wi mantling ream
 An sheds a heartinspiring steam
 The luntin pipe an sneeshin mill
 Are handed round wi right guid will
 The cantie auld folks crackin crouse
 The young anes rantin thro the house
 My heart has been sae fain to see them
 That I for joy hae barkit wi them

 Still its owre true that ye hae said
 Sic game is now owre aften playd
 Theres mony a creditable stock
 O decent honest fawsont folk
 Are riven out baith root an branch
 Some rascals pridefu greed to quench
 Wha thinks to knit himsel the faster
 In favour wi some gentle master
 Wha aiblins thrang a parliamentin
 For Britains guid his saul indentin




 Caesar

 Haith lad ye little ken about it
 For Britains guid guid faith I doubt it
 Say rather gaun as Premiers lead him
 An saying ay or nos they bid him
 At operas an plays parading
 Mortgaging gambling masquerading
 Or maybe in a frolic daft
 To Hague or Calais takes a waft
 To mak a tour an tak a whirl
 To learn bon ton an see the worl

 There at Vienna or Versailles
 He rives his fathers auld entails
 Or by Madrid he takes the rout
 To thrum guitars an fecht wi nowt
 Or down Italian vista startles

 Whorehunting amang groves o myrtles
 Then bowses drumlie Germanwater
 To mak himsel look fair an fatter
 An clear the consequential sorrows
 Lovegifts of Carnival signoras

 For Britains guid for her destruction
 Wi dissipation feud an faction




 Luath

 Hech man dear sirs is that the gate
 They waste sae mony a braw estate
 Are we sae foughten an harassd
 For gear to gang that gate at last

 O would they stay aback frae courts
 An please themsels wi country sports
 It wad for evry ane be better
 The laird the tenant an the cotter
 For thae frank rantin ramblin billies
 Feint haet o thems illhearted fellows
 Except for breakin o their timmer
 Or speakin lightly o their limmer
 Or shootin of a hare or moorcock
 The neerabit theyre ill to poor folk

 But will ye tell me Master Caesar
 Sure great folks lifes a life o pleasure
 Nae cauld nor hunger eer can steer them
 The very thought ot need na fear them




 Caesar

 Lord man were ye but whiles whare I am
 The gentles ye wad neer envy them

 Its true they need na starve or sweat
 Thro winters cauld or simmers heat
 Theyve nae sair wark to craze their banes
 An fill auld age wi grips an granes
 But human bodies are sic fools
 For a their colleges an schools
 That when nae real ills perplex them
 They mak enow themsels to vex them
 An aye the less they hae to sturt them
 In like proportion less will hurt them

 A country fellow at the pleugh
 His acres tilld hes right eneugh
 A country girl at her wheel
 Her dizzens dune shes unco weel
 But gentlemen an ladies warst
 Wi evndown want o wark are curst
 They loiter lounging lank an lazy
 Tho deilhaet ails them yet uneasy
 Their days insipid dull an tasteless
 Their nights unquiet lang an restless

 Anevn their sports their balls an races
 Their galloping through public places
 Theres sic parade sic pomp an art
 The joy can scarcely reach the heart

 The men cast out in partymatches
 Then sowther a in deep debauches
 Ae night theyre mad wi drink an whoring
 Niest day their life is past enduring

 The ladies arminarm in clusters
 As great an gracious a as sisters
 But hear their absent thoughts o ither
 Theyre a rundeils an jads thegither
 Whiles owre the wee bit cup an platie
 They sip the scandalpotion pretty
 Or leelang nights wi crabbit leuks
 Pore owre the devils picturd beuks
 Stake on a chance a farmers stackyard
 An cheat like ony unhanged blackguard

 Theres some exceptions man an woman
 But this is gentrys life in common

 By this the sun was out of sight
 An darker gloamin brought the night
 The bumclock hummd wi lazy drone
 The kye stood rowtin i the loan
 When up they gat an shook their lugs
 Rejoicd they werena men but dogs
 An each took aff his several way
 Resolvd to meet some ither day

 But feels his hearts bluid rising hot
 To see his poor auld mithers pot
 Thus dung in staves
 An plunderd o her hindmost groat
 By gallows knaves

 An no get warmly to your feet

 Postscript

 Let halfstarvd slaves in warmer skies
 See future wines richclustring rise
 Their lot auld Scotland nere envies
 But blythe and frisky
 She eyes her freeborn martial boys
 Tak aff their whisky

 What tho their Phoebus kinder warms
 While fragrance blooms and beauty charms
 When wretches range in famishd swarms
 The scented groves
 Or hounded forth dishonour arms
 In hungry droves

 Their guns a burden on their shouther
 They downa bide the stink o powther
 Their bauldest thoughts a hankring swither
 To stan or rin
 Till skelpa shottheyre aff athrowther
 To save their skin

 But bring a Scotchman frae his hill
 Clap in his cheek a Highland gill
 Say such is royal Georges will
 An theres the foe
 He has nae thought but how to kill
 Twa at a blow

 Nae cauld fainthearted doubtings tease him
 Death comes wi fearless eye he sees him
 Wibluidy hand a welcome gies him
 An when he fas
 His latest draught o breathin leaes him
 In faint huzzas

 Sages their solemn een may steek
 An raise a philosophic reek
 An physically causes seek
 In clime an season
 But tell me whiskys name in Greek
 Ill tell the reason

 Scotland my auld respected mither
 Tho whiles ye moistify your leather
 Till whare ye sit on craps o heather
 Ye tine your dam
 Freedom an whisky gang thegither
 Take aff your dram




The Ordination

 For sense they little owe to frugal Heavn
 To please the mob they hide the little givn

 Kilmarnock wabsters fidge an claw
 An pour your creeshie nations
 An ye wha leather rax an draw
 Of a denominations
 Swith to the Ligh Kirk ane an a
 An there tak up your stations
 Then aff to Begbies in a raw
 An pour divine libations
 For joy this day

 O double verse come gie us four

 This day the kirk kicks up a stoure
 Nae mair the knaves shall wrang her
 For Heresy is in her powr
 And gloriously shell whang her
 Wi pith this day

 Come let a proper text be read
 An touch it aff wi vigour
 How graceless Ham5 leugh at his dad
 Which made Canaan a nigger
 Or Phineas6 drove the murdering blade
 Wi whoreabhorring rigour
 Or Zipporah7 the scauldin jad
 Was like a bluidy tiger
 I th inn that day

 There try his mettle on the creed
 An bind him down wi caution
 That stipend is a carnal weed
 He taks by for the fashion
 And gie him oer the flock to feed
 And punish each transgression
 Especial rams that cross the breed
 Gie them sufficient threshin
 Spare them nae day

 Now auld Kilmarnock cock thy tail
 An toss thy horns fu canty
 Nae mair thoult rowt outowre the dale
 Because thy pastures scanty
 For lapfus large o gospel kail

 Oh rare to see our elbucks wheep
 And a like lambtails flyin

 Lang Patronage with rod o airn
 Has shord the Kirks undoin
 As lately Fenwick sair forfairn

 Our patron honest man Glencairn

 Hes waled us out a true ane
 And sound this day

 Now Robertson9 harangue nae mair
 But steek your gab for ever

 For there theyll think you clever
 Or nae reflection on your lear

 We never had sic twa drones
 Auld Hornie did the Laigh Kirk watch

 Grunts out some Latin ditty
 And Commonsense is gaun she says
 To mak to Jamie Beattie
 Her plaint this day

 But theres Morality himsel
 Embracing all opinions
 Hear how he gies the tither yell
 Between his twa companions
 See how she peels the skin an fell
 As ane were peelin onions
 Now there theyre packed aff to hell
 An banishd our dominions
 Henceforth this day

 O happy day rejoice rejoice
 Come bouse about the porter
 Moralitys demure decoys
 Shall here nae mair find quarter
 Mackinlay Russell are the boys
 That heresy can torture
 Theyll gie her on a rape a hoyse
 And cowe her measure shorter
 By th head some day

 Come bring the tither mutchkin in
 And heresfor a conclusion

 Well light a spunk and evry skin
 Well rin them aff in fusion

Epistle To James Smith

 Friendship mysterious cement of the soul
 Sweetner of Life and solder of Society
 I owe thee muchBlair

 Dear Smith the sleest pawkie thief
 That eer attempted stealth or rief
 Ye surely hae some warlockbrief
 Owre human hearts
 For neer a bosom yet was prief
 Against your arts

 For me I swear by sun an moon
 An evry star that blinks aboon
 Yeve cost me twenty pair o shoon
 Just gaun to see you
 An evry ither pair thats done
 Mair taen Im wi you

 That auld capricious carlin Nature
 To mak amends for scrimpit stature
 Shes turnd you off a human creature
 On her first plan
 And in her freaks on evry feature
 Shes wrote the Man

 Just now Ive taen the fit o rhyme
 My barmie noddles working prime
 My fancy yerkit up sublime
 Wi hasty summon
 Hae ye a leisuremoments time
 To hear whats comin

 Some rhyme a neibors name to lash
 Some rhyme vain thought for needfu cash
 Some rhyme to court the countra clash
 An raise a din
 For me an aim I never fash
 I rhyme for fun

 The star that rules my luckless lot
 Has fated me the russet coat
 An damnd my fortune to the groat
 But in requit
 Has blest me with a randomshot
 Ocountra wit

 This while my notions taen a sklent
 To try my fate in guid black prent
 But still the mair Im that way bent
 Something cries Hooklie
 I red you honest man tak tent
 Yell shaw your folly

 Theres ither poets much your betters
 Far seen in Greek deep men o letters
 Hae thought they had ensurd their debtors
 A future ages
 Now moths deform in shapeless tatters
 Their unknown pages

 Then farewell hopes of laurelboughs
 To garland my poetic brows
 Henceforth Ill rove where busy ploughs
 Are whistlin thrang
 An teach the lanely heights an howes
 My rustic sang

 Ill wander on wi tentless heed
 How neverhalting moments speed
 Till fate shall snap the brittle thread
 Then all unknown
 Ill lay me with th inglorious dead
 Forgot and gone

 But why o death being a tale
 Just now were living sound and hale
 Then top and maintop crowd the sail
 Heave Care oerside
 And large before Enjoyments gale
 Lets tak the tide

 This life sae fars I understand
 Is a enchanted fairyland
 Where Pleasure is the magicwand
 That wielded right
 Maks hours like minutes hand in hand
 Dance by fu light

 The magicwand then let us wield
 For ance that fiveanfortys speeld
 See crazy weary joyless eild
 Wi wrinkld face
 Comes hostin hirplin owre the field
 We creepin pace

 When ance lifes day draws near the gloamin
 Then fareweel vacant careless roamin
 An fareweel cheerfu tankards foamin
 An social noise
 An fareweel dear deluding woman
 The Joy of joys

 O Life how pleasant in thy morning
 Young Fancys rays the hills adorning
 Coldpausing Cautions lesson scorning
 We frisk away
 Like schoolboys at th expected warning
 To joy an play

 We wander there we wander here
 We eye the rose upon the brier
 Unmindful that the thorn is near
 Among the leaves
 And tho the puny wound appear
 Short while it grieves

 Some lucky find a flowry spot
 For which they never toild nor swat
 They drink the sweet and eat the fat
 But care or pain
 And haply eye the barren hut
 With high disdain

 With steady aim some Fortune chase
 Keen hope does evry sinew brace
 Thro fair thro foul they urge the race
 An seize the prey
 Then cannie in some cozie place
 They close the day

 And others like your humble servan
 Poor wights nae rules nor roads observin
 To right or left eternal swervin
 They zigzag on
 Till curst with age obscure an starvin
 They aften groan

 Alas what bitter toil an straining
 But truce with peevish poor complaining
 Is fortunes fickle Luna waning
 En let her gang
 Beneath what light she has remaining
 Lets sing our sang

 My pen I here fling to the door
 And kneel ye Powrs and warm implore
 Tho I should wander Terra oer
 In all her climes
 Grant me but this I ask no more
 Aye rowth o rhymes

 Gie dreepin roasts to countra lairds
 Till icicles hing frae their beards
 Gie fine braw claes to fine lifeguards
 And maids of honour
 An yill an whisky gie to cairds
 Until they sconner

 A title Dempster1 merits it
 A garter gie to Willie Pitt
 Gie wealth to some beledgerd cit
 In cent per cent
 But give me real sterling wit
 And Im content

 Footnote 1 George Dempster of Dunnichen MP

 While ye are pleasd to keep me hale
 Ill sit down oer my scanty meal
 Bet waterbrose or muslinkail
 Wi cheerfu face
 As langs the Muses dinna fail
 To say the grace

 An anxious ee I never throws
 Behint my lug or by my nose
 I jouk beneath Misfortunes blows
 As weels I may
 Sworn foe to sorrow care and prose
 I rhyme away

 O ye douce folk that live by rule
 Grave tidelessblooded calm ancool
 Compard wi youO fool fool fool
 How much unlike
 Your hearts are just a standing pool
 Your lives a dyke

 Nae hairbraind sentimental traces
 In your unletterd nameless faces
 In arioso trills and graces
 Ye never stray
 But gravissimo solemn basses
 Ye hum away

 Ye are sae grave nae doubt yere wise
 Nae ferly tho ye do despise
 The hairumscairum ramstam boys
 The rattling squad
 I see ye upward cast your eyes
 Ye ken the road

 Whilst Ibut I shall haud me there
 Wi you Ill scarce gang ony where
 Then Jamie I shall say nae mair
 But quat my sang
 Content wi you to mak a pair
 Whareer I gang




The Vision

 Duan First1

 The sun had closd the winter day
 The curless quat their roarin play
 And hungerd maukin taen her way
 To kailyards green
 While faithless snaws ilk step betray
 Whare she has been

 The threshers weary flingintree
 The leelang day had tired me
 And when the day had closd his ee
 Far i the west
 Ben i the spence right pensivelie
 I gaed to rest

 There lanely by the inglecheek
 I sat and eyd the spewing reek
 That filld wi hoastprovoking smeek
 The auld clay biggin
 An heard the restless rattons squeak
 About the riggin

 All in this mottie misty clime
 I backward musd on wasted time
 How I had spent my youthfu prime
 An done nae thing
 But stringing blethers up in rhyme
 For fools to sing

 Had I to guid advice but harkit
 I might by this hae led a market
 Or strutted in a bank and clarkit
 My cashaccount
 While here halfmad halffed halfsarkit
 Is a th amount

 Footnote 1 Duan a term of Ossians for the different
 divisions of a digressive poem See his CathLoda vol 2 of
 MPhersons translationR B

 I started muttring blockhead coof
 And heavd on high my waukit loof
 To swear by a yon starry roof
 Or some rash aith
 That I henceforth wad be rhymeproof
 Till my last breath

 When click the string the snick did draw
 An jee the door gaed to the wa
 An by my inglelowe I saw
 Now bleezin bright
 A tight outlandish hizzie braw
 Come full in sight

 Ye need na doubt I held my whisht
 The infant aith halfformd was crusht
 I glowrd as eeries Id been dusht
 In some wild glen
 When sweet like honest Worth she blusht
 An stepped ben

 Green slender leafclad hollyboughs
 Were twisted gracefu round her brows
 I took her for some Scottish Muse
 By that same token
 And come to stop those reckless vows
 Would soon been broken

 A hairbraind sentimental trace
 Was strongly marked in her face
 A wildlywitty rustic grace
 Shone full upon her
 Her eye evn turnd on empty space
 Beamd keen with honour

 Down flowd her robe a tartan sheen
 Till half a leg was scrimply seen
 An such a leg my bonie Jean
 Could only peer it
 Sae straught sae taper tight an clean
 Nane else came near it

 Her mantle large of greenish hue
 My gazing wonder chiefly drew
 Deep lights and shades boldmingling threw
 A lustre grand
 And seemd to my astonishd view
 A wellknown land

 Here rivers in the sea were lost
 There mountains to the skies were tosst
 Here tumbling billows markd the coast
 With surging foam
 There distant shone Arts lofty boast
 The lordly dome

 Here Doon pourd down his farfetchd floods
 There wellfed Irwine stately thuds
 Auld hermit Ayr staw thro his woods
 On to the shore
 And many a lesser torrent scuds
 With seeming roar

 Low in a sandy valley spread
 An ancient borough reard her head
 Still as in Scottish story read
 She boasts a race
 To evry nobler virtue bred
 And polishd grace2

 By stately towr or palace fair
 Or ruins pendent in the air
 Bold stems of heroes here and there
 I could discern
 Some seemd to muse some seemd to dare
 With feature stern

 My heart did glowing transport feel
 To see a race heroic3 wheel

 Footnote 3 The WallacesR B

 And brandish round the deepdyed steel
 In sturdy blows
 While backrecoiling seemd to reel
 Their Suthron foes

 His Countrys Saviour4 mark him well
 Bold Richardtons heroic swell5
 The chief on Sark who glorious fell6
 In high command
 And he whom ruthless fates expel
 His native land

 There where a sceptrd Pictish shade
 Stalkd round his ashes lowly laid7
 I markd a martial race pourtrayd
 In colours strong
 Bold soldierfeaturd undismayd
 They strode along

 Thro many a wild romantic grove8
 Near many a hermitfancied cove
 Fit haunts for friendship or for love
 In musing mood
 An aged Judge I saw him rove
 Dispensing good

 With deepstruck reverential awe
 The learned Sire and Son I saw9
 To Natures God and Natures law
 They gave their lore
 This all its source and end to draw
 That to adore

 And hero shone




 Duan Second

 With musingdeep astonishd stare
 I viewd the heavenlyseeming Fair
 A whispering throb did witness bear
 Of kindred sweet
 When with an elder sisters air
 She did me greet

 All hail my own inspired bard
 In me thy native Muse regard
 Nor longer mourn thy fate is hard
 Thus poorly low
 I come to give thee such reward
 As we bestow

 Know the great genius of this land
 Has many a light aerial band
 Who all beneath his high command
 Harmoniously
 As arts or arms they understand
 Their labours ply

 They Scotias race among them share
 Some fire the soldier on to dare
 Some rouse the patriot up to bare
 Corruptions heart
 Some teach the barda darling care
 The tuneful art

 Mong swelling floods of reeking gore
 They ardent kindling spirits pour

 Footnote 10 Colonel FullartonRB This gentleman had
 travelled under the care of Patrick Brydone author of a
 wellknown Tour Through Sicily and Malta

 Or mid the venal senates roar
 They sightless stand
 To mend the honest patriotlore
 And grace the hand

 And when the bard or hoary sage
 Charm or instruct the future age
 They bind the wild poetric rage
 In energy
 Or point the inconclusive page
 Full on the eye

 Hence Fullarton the brave and young
 Hence Dempsters zealinspired tongue
 Hence sweet harmonious Beattie sung
 His Minstrel lays
 Or tore with noble ardour stung
 The sceptics bays

 To lower orders are assignd
 The humbler ranks of humankind
 The rustic bard the labring hind
 The artisan
 All choose as various theyre inclind
 The various man

 When yellow waves the heavy grain
 The threatning storm some strongly rein
 Some teach to meliorate the plain
 With tillageskill
 And some instruct the shepherdtrain
 Blythe oer the hill

 Some hint the lovers harmless wile
 Some grace the maidens artless smile
 Some soothe the labrers weary toil
 For humble gains
 And make his cottagescenes beguile
 His cares and pains

 Some bounded to a districtspace
 Explore at large mans infant race
 To mark the embryotic trace
 Of rustic bard
 And careful note each opening grace
 A guide and guard

 Of these am ICoila my name
 And this district as mine I claim
 Where once the Campbells chiefs of fame
 Held ruling power
 I markd thy embryotuneful flame
 Thy natal hour

 With future hope I oft would gaze
 Fond on thy little early ways
 Thy rudely carolld chiming phrase
 In uncouth rhymes
 Fird at the simple artless lays
 Of other times

 I saw thee seek the sounding shore
 Delighted with the dashing roar
 Or when the North his fleecy store
 Drove thro the sky
 I saw grim Natures visage hoar
 Struck thy young eye

 Or when the deep greenmantled earth
 Warm cherishd evry flowerets birth
 And joy and music pouring forth
 In evry grove
 I saw thee eye the general mirth
 With boundless love

 When ripend fields and azure skies
 Calld forth the reapers rustling noise
 I saw thee leave their evning joys
 And lonely stalk
 To vent thy bosoms swelling rise
 In pensive walk

 When youthful love warmblushing strong
 Keenshivering shot thy nerves along
 Those accents grateful to thy tongue
 Th adored Name
 I taught thee how to pour in song
 To soothe thy flame

 I saw thy pulses maddening play
 Wild send thee Pleasures devious way
 Misled by Fancys meteorray
 By passion driven
 But yet the light that led astray
 Was light from Heaven

 I taught thy mannerspainting strains
 The loves the ways of simple swains
 Till now oer all my wide domains
 Thy fame extends
 And some the pride of Coilas plains
 Become thy friends

 Thou canst not learn nor I can show
 To paint with Thomsons landscape glow
 Or wake the bosommelting throe
 With Shenstones art
 Or pour with Gray the moving flow
 Warm on the heart

 Yet all beneath th unrivalld rose
 T e lowly daisy sweetly blows
 Tho large the forests monarch throws
 His army shade
 Yet green the juicy hawthorn grows
 Adown the glade

 Then never murmur nor repine
 Strive in thy humble sphere to shine
 And trust me not Potosis mine
 Nor kings regard
 Can give a bliss oermatching thine
 A rustic bard

 To give my counsels all in one
 Thy tuneful flame still careful fan
 Preserve the dignity of Man
 With soul erect
 And trust the Universal Plan
 Will all protect

 And wear thou thisshe solemn said
 And bound the holly round my head
 The polishd leaves and berries red
 Did rustling play
 And like a passing thought she fled
 In light away

 To Mrs Stewart of Stair Burns presented a manuscript copy of

 Duan First which he cancelled when he came to print the price in
 his Kilmarnock volume Seven of these he restored in printing his
 second edition as noted on p 174 The following are the verses

Suppressed Stanzas Of The Vision

 After 18th stanza of the text at His native land

 With secret throes I marked that earth
 That cottage witness of my birth
 And near I saw bold issuing forth
 In youthful pride
 A Lindsay race of noble worth
 Famed far and wide

 Where hid behind a spreading wood
 An ancient Pictbuilt mansion stood
 I spied among an angel brood
 A female pair
 Sweet shone their high maternal blood
 And fathers air1

 An ancient tower2 to memory brought
 How Dettingens bold hero fought
 Still far from sinking into nought
 It owns a lord
 Who far in western climates fought
 With trusty sword

 Footnote 1 SundrumRB

 Footnote 2 StairRB

 Among the rest I well could spy
 One gallant graceful martial boy
 The soldier sparkled in his eye
 A diamond water
 I blest that noble badge with joy
 That owned me frater3




 After 20th stanza of the text at Dispensing good

 Near by arose a mansion fine4
 The seat of many a muse divine
 Not rustic muses such as mine
 With holly crownd
 But th ancient tuneful laurelld Nine
 From classic ground

 I mournd the card that Fortune dealt
 To see where bonie Whitefoords dwelt5
 But other prospects made me melt
 That village near6
 There Nature Friendship Love I felt
 Fondmingling dear

 Hail Natures pang more strong than death
 Warm Friendships glow like kindling wrath
 Love dearer than the parting breath
 Of dying friend
 Not evn with lifes wild devious path
 Your force shall end

 The Power that gave the soft alarms
 In blooming Whitefoords rosy charms
 Still threats the tiny featherd arms
 The barbed dart
 While lovely Wilhelmina warms
 The coldest heart7




 After 21st stanza of the text at That to adore

 Where lately Want was idly laid

 Footnote 8 CumnockRB

 I marked busy bustling Trade
 In fervid flame
 Beneath a Patroness aid
 of noble name

 Wild countless hills I could survey
 And countless flocks as wild as they
 But other scenes did charms display
 That better please
 Where polishd manners dwell with Gray
 In rural ease9

 Where Cessnock pours with gurgling sound10
 And Irwine marking out the bound
 Enamourd of the scenes around
 Slow runs his race
 A name I doubly honourd found11
 With knightly grace

 Brydons brave ward12 I saw him stand
 Fame humbly offering her hand
 And near his kinsmans rustic band13
 With one accord
 Lamenting their late blessed land
 Must change its lord

 The owner of a pleasant spot
 Near and sandy wilds I last did note14
 A heart too warm a pulse too hot
 At times oerran

Address To The Unco Guid Or The Rigidly Righteous

 My Son these maxims make a rule
 An lump them aye thegither
 The Rigid Righteous is a fool
 The Rigid Wise anither
 The cleanest corn that ere was dight
 May hae some pyles o caff in
 So neer a fellowcreature slight
 For random fits o daffin

 SolomonEccles ch vii verse 16

 O ye wha are sae guid yoursel
 Sae pious and sae holy
 Yeve nought to do but mark and tell
 Your neibours fauts and folly
 Whase life is like a weelgaun mill
 Supplied wi store o water
 The heaped happers ebbing still
 An still the clap plays clatter

 Hear me ye venerable core
 As counsel for poor mortals
 That frequent pass douce Wisdoms door
 For glaikit Follys portals
 I for their thoughtless careless sakes
 Would here propone defences
 Their donsie tricks their black mistakes
 Their failings and mischances

 Ye see your state wi theirs compared
 And shudder at the niffer
 But cast a moments fair regard
 What maks the mighty differ
 Discount what scant occasion gave
 That purity ye pride in
 And whats aft mair than a the lave
 Your better art o hidin

 Think when your castigated pulse
 Gies now and then a wallop
 What ragings must his veins convulse
 That still eternal gallop
 Wi wind and tide fair i your tail
 Right on ye scud your seaway
 But in the teeth o baith to sail
 It maks a unco leeway

 See Social Life and Glee sit down
 All joyous and unthinking
 Till quite transmugrified theyre grown
 Debauchery and Drinking
 O would they stay to calculate
 Th eternal consequences
 Or your more dreaded hell to state
 Damnation of expenses

 Ye high exalted virtuous dames
 Tied up in godly laces
 Before ye gie poor Frailty names
 Suppose a change o cases
 A dearlovd lad convenience snug
 A treachrous inclination
 But let me whisper i your lug
 Yere aiblins nae temptation

 Then gently scan your brother man
 Still gentler sister woman
 Tho they may gang a kennin wrang
 To step aside is human
 One point must still be greatly dark
 The moving Why they do it
 And just as lamely can ye mark
 How far perhaps they rue it

 Who made the heart tis He alone
 Decidedly can try us
 He knows each chord its various tone
 Each spring its various bias
 Then at the balance lets be mute
 We never can adjust it
 Whats done we partly may compute
 But know not whats resisted

To A Louse On Seeing One On A Ladys Bonnet At Church

 Ha whaur ye gaun ye crowlin ferlie
 Your impudence protects you sairly
 I canna say but ye strunt rarely
 Owre gauze and lace
 Tho faith I fear ye dine but sparely
 On sic a place

 Detested shunnd by saunt an sinner
 How daur ye set your fit upon her
 Sae fine a lady
 Gae somewhere else and seek your dinner
 On some poor body

 Swith in some beggars haffet squattle
 There ye may creep and sprawl and sprattle
 Wi ither kindred jumping cattle
 In shoals and nations
 Whaur horn nor bane neer daur unsettle
 Your thick plantations

 Now haud you there yere out o sight
 Below the fattrels snug and tight
 Na faith ye yet yell no be right
 Till yeve got on it
 The verra tapmost towrin height
 O Miss bonnet

 My sooth right bauld ye set your nose out
 As plump an grey as ony groset
 O for some rank mercurial rozet
 Or fell red smeddum
 Id gie you sic a hearty dose ot
 Wad dress your droddum

 I wad na been surprisd to spy
 You on an auld wifes flainen toy
 Or aiblins some bit dubbie boy

 But Miss fine Lunardi fye
 How daur ye dot

 O Jeany dinna toss your head
 An set your beauties a abread
 Ye little ken what cursed speed

 To see oursels as ithers see us
 It wad frae mony a blunder free us
 An foolish notion
 What airs in dress an gait wad leae us
 An evn devotion




Inscribed On A Work Of Hannah Mores

 Presented to the Author by a Lady

 Thou flattring mark of friendship kind
 Still may thy pages call to mind
 The dear the beauteous donor
 Tho sweetly female evry part
 Yet such a head and more the heart
 Does both the sexes honour
 She showd her taste refind and just
 When she selected thee
 Yet deviating own I must
 For sae approving me
 But kind still Ill mind still
 The giver in the gift
 Ill bless her an wiss her
 A Friend aboon the lift




Song Composed In Spring

 TuneJockeys Grey Breeks


 Again rejoicing Nature sees
 Her robe assume its vernal hues
 Her leafy locks wave in the breeze
 All freshly steepd in morning dews

 ChorusAnd maun I still on Menie doat
 And bear the scorn thats in her ee
 For its jet jet black an its like a hawk
 An it winna let a body be

 In vain to me the cowslips blaw
 In vain to me the vilets spring
 In vain to me in glen or shaw
 The mavis and the lintwhite sing
 And maun I still c

 The merry ploughboy cheers his team
 Wi joy the tentie seedsman stalks
 But life to mes a weary dream
 A dream of ane that never wauks
 And maun I still c

 The wanton coot the water skims
 Amang the reeds the ducklings cry
 The stately swan majestic swims
 And evry thing is blest but I
 And maun I still c

 The sheepherd steeks his faulding slap
 And oer the moorlands whistles shill
 Wi wild unequal wandring step
 I meet him on the dewy hill
 And maun I still c

 And when the lark tween light and dark
 Blythe waukens by the daisys side
 And mounts and sings on flittering wings
 A woeworn ghaist I hameward glide
 And maun I still c

 Come winter with thine angry howl
 And raging bend the naked tree
 Thy gloom will soothe my cheerless soul
 When nature all is sad like me
 And maun I still c




To A Mountain Daisy

 On turning down with the Plough in April 1786

 Wee modest crimsontipped flowr
 Thous met me in an evil hour
 For I maun crush amang the stoure
 Thy slender stem
 To spare thee now is past my powr
 Thou bonie gem

 Alas its no thy neibor sweet
 The bonie lark companion meet
 Bending thee mang the dewy weet
 Wi spreckld breast
 When upwardspringing blythe to greet
 The purpling east

 Cauld blew the bitterbiting north
 Upon thy early humble birth
 Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth
 Amid the storm
 Scarce reard above the parentearth
 Thy tender form

 The flaunting flowrs our gardens yield
 High sheltring woods and was maun shield
 But thou beneath the random bield
 O clod or stane
 Adorns the histie stibble field
 Unseen alane

 There in thy scanty mantle clad
 Thy snawie bosom sunward spread
 Thou lifts thy unassuming head
 In humble guise
 But now the share uptears thy bed
 And low thou lies

 Such is the fate of artless maid
 Sweet flowret of the rural shade
 By loves simplicity betrayd
 And guileless trust
 Till she like thee all soild is laid
 Low i the dust

 Such is the fate of simple bard
 On lifes rough ocean luckless starrd
 Unskilful he to note the card
 Of prudent lore
 Till billows rage and gales blow hard
 And whelm him oer

 Such fate to suffering worth is givn
 Who long with wants and woes has strivn
 By human pride or cunning drivn
 To misrys brink
 Till wrenchd of evry stay but Heavn
 He ruind sink

 Evn thou who mournst the Daisys fate
 That fate is thineno distant date
 Stern Ruins ploughshare drives elate
 Full on thy bloom
 Till crushd beneath the furrows weight
 Shall be thy doom




To Ruin

 All hail inexorable lord
 At whose destructionbreathing word
 The mightiest empires fall
 Thy cruel woedelighted train
 The ministers of grief and pain
 A sullen welcome all

 With sternresolvd despairing eye
 I see each aimed dart
 For one has cut my dearest tie
 And quivers in my heart
 Then lowring and pouring
 The storm no more I dread
 Tho thickning and blackning
 Round my devoted head

 And thou grim Powr by life abhorrd
 While life a pleasure can afford
 Oh hear a wretchs prayr
 Nor more I shrink appalld afraid
 I court I beg thy friendly aid
 To close this scene of care
 When shall my soul in silent peace
 Resign lifes joyless day
 My weary heart its throbbing cease
 Cold mouldring in the clay
 No fear more no tear more
 To stain my lifeless face
 Enclasped and grasped
 Within thy cold embrace




The Lament

 Occasioned by the unfortunate issue of a Friends Amour

 Alas how oft does goodness would itself
 And sweet affection prove the spring of woe

 Home

 O thou pale orb that silent shines
 While careuntroubled mortals sleep
 Thou seest a wretch who inly pines
 And wanders here to wail and weep
 With woe I nightly vigils keep
 Beneath thy wan unwarming beam
 And mourn in lamentation deep
 How life and love are all a dream

 I joyless view thy rays adorn
 The faintlymarked distant hill
 I joyless view thy trembling horn
 Reflected in the gurgling rill
 My fondlyfluttering heart be still
 Thou busy powr remembrance cease
 Ah must the agonizing thrill
 For ever bar returning peace

 No idlyfeignd poetic pains
 My sad lovelorn lamentings claim
 No shepherds pipeArcadian strains
 No fabled tortures quaint and tame
 The plighted faith the mutual flame
 The oftattested powrs above
 The promisd fathers tender name
 These were the pledges of my love

 Encircled in her clasping arms
 How have the rapturd moments flown
 How have I wishd for fortunes charms
 For her dear sake and hers alone
 And must I think it is she gone
 My secret hearts exulting boast
 And does she heedless hear my groan
 And is she ever ever lost

 Oh can she bear so base a heart
 So lost to honour lost to truth
 As from the fondest lover part
 The plighted husband of her youth
 Alas lifes path may be unsmooth
 Her way may lie thro rough distress
 Then who her pangs and pains will soothe
 Her sorrows share and make them less

 Ye winged hours that oer us passd
 Enrapturd more the more enjoyd
 Your dear remembrance in my breast
 My fondlytreasurd thoughts employd
 That breast how dreary now and void
 For her too scanty once of room
 Evn evry ray of hope destroyd
 And not a wish to gild the gloom

 The morn that warns th approaching day
 Awakes me up to toil and woe
 I see the hours in long array
 That I must suffer lingering slow
 Full many a pang and many a throe
 Keen recollections direful train
 Must wring my soul were Phoebus low
 Shall kiss the distant western main

 And when my nightly couch I try
 Sore harassd out with care and grief
 My toilbeat nerves and tearworn eye
 Keep watchings with the nightly thief
 Or if I slumber fancy chief
 Reigns haggardwild in sore affright
 Evn day allbitter brings relief
 From such a horrorbreathing night

 O thou bright queen who oer th expanse
 Now highest reignst with boundless sway
 Oft has thy silentmarking glance
 Observd us fondlywandring stray
 The time unheeded sped away
 While loves luxurious pulse beat high
 Beneath thy silvergleaming ray
 To mark the mutualkindling eye

 Oh scenes in strong remembrance set
 Scenes never never to return
 Scenes if in stupor I forget
 Again I feel again I burn
 From evry joy and pleasure torn
 Lifes weary vale Ill wander thro
 And hopeless comfortless Ill mourn
 A faithless womans broken vow




Despondency An Ode

 Oppressd with grief oppressd with care
 A burden more than I can bear
 I set me down and sigh
 O life thou art a galling load
 Along a rough a weary road
 To wretches such as I
 Dim backward as I cast my view
 What sickning scenes appear
 What sorrows yet may pierce me through
 Too justly I may fear
 Still caring despairing
 Must be my bitter doom
 My woes here shall close neer
 But with the closing tomb

 Happy ye sons of busy life
 Who equal to the bustling strife
 No other view regard
 Evn when the wished ends denied
 Yet while the busy means are plied
 They bring their own reward
 Whilst I a hopeabandond wight
 Unfitted with an aim
 Meet evry sad returning night
 And joyless morn the same
 You bustling and justling
 Forget each grief and pain
 I listless yet restless
 Find evry prospect vain

 How blest the solitarys lot
 Who allforgetting all forgot
 Within his humble cell
 The cavern wild with tangling roots
 Sits oer his newly gatherd fruits
 Beside his crystal well
 Or haply to his evning thought
 By unfrequented stream
 The ways of men are distant brought
 A faint collected dream
 While praising and raising
 His thoughts to heavn on high
 As wandring meandring
 He views the solemn sky

 Than I no lonely hermit placd
 Where never human footstep tracd
 Less fit to play the part
 The lucky moment to improve
 And just to stop and just to move
 With selfrespecting art
 But ah those pleasures loves and joys
 Which I too keenly taste
 The solitary can despise
 Can want and yet be blest
 He needs not he heeds not
 Or human love or hate
 Whilst I here must cry here
 At perfidy ingrate

 O enviable early days
 When dancing thoughtless pleasures maze
 To care to guilt unknown
 How ill exchangd for riper times
 To feel the follies or the crimes
 Of others or my own
 Ye tiny elves that guiltless sport
 Like linnets in the bush
 Ye little know the ills ye court
 When manhood is your wish
 The losses the crosses
 That active man engage
 The fears all the tears all
 Of dim declining age

 Recommending a Boy

 Mossgaville May 3 1786

 I hold it sir my bounden duty
 To warn you how that Master Tootie
 Alias Laird MGaun
 Was here to hire yon lad away
 Bout whom ye spak the tither day
 An wad hae dont aff han

 But lest he learn the callan tricks
 An faith I muckle doubt him
 Like scrapin out auld Crummies nicks
 An tellin lies about them
 As lieve then Id have then
 Your clerkship he should sair
 If sae be ye may be
 Not fitted otherwhere

 Altho I sayt hes gleg enough
 An bout a house thats rude an rough
 The boy might learn to swear
 But then wi you hell be sae taught
 An get sic fair example straught
 I hae na ony fear
 Yell catechise him every quirk
 An shore him weel wi hell
 An gar him follow to the kirk
 Aye when ye gang yoursel
 If ye then maun be then
 Frae hame this comin Friday
 Then please sir to leae sir
 The orders wi your lady

 My word of honour I hae gien
 In Paisley Johns that night at een
 To meet the warlds worm
 To try to get the twa to gree
 An name the airles an the fee
 In legal mode an form
 I ken he weel a snick can draw
 When simple bodies let him
 An if a Devil be at a
 In faith hes sure to get him
 To phrase you and praise you
 Ye ken your Laureat scorns
 The prayr still you share still
 Of grateful Minstrel Burns

SongWill Ye Go To The Indies My Mary

 TuneWill ye go to the EweBughts Marion


 Will ye go to the Indies my Mary
 And leave auld Scotias shore
 Will ye go to the Indies my Mary
 Across th Atlantic roar

 O sweet grows the lime and the orange
 And the apple on the pine
 But a the charms o the Indies
 Can never equal thine

 I hae sworn by the Heavens to my Mary
 I hae sworn by the Heavens to be true
 And sae may the Heavens forget me
 When I forget my vow

 O plight me your faith my Mary
 And plight me your lilywhite hand
 O plight me your faith my Mary
 Before I leave Scotias strand

 We hae plighted our troth my Mary
 In mutual affection to join
 And curst be the cause that shall part us
 The hour and the moment o time




SongMy Highland Lassie O

 TuneThe deuks dang oer my daddy


 Nae gentle dames tho eer sae fair
 Shall ever be my muses care
 Their titles a arc empty show
 Gie me my Highland lassie O

 ChorusWithin the glen sae bushy O
 Aboon the plain sae rashy O
 I set me down wi right guid will
 To sing my Highland lassie O

 O were yon hills and vallies mine
 Yon palace and yon gardens fine
 The world then the love should know
 I bear my Highland Lassie O

 But fickle fortune frowns on me
 And I maun cross the raging sea
 But while my crimson currents flow
 Ill love my Highland lassie O

 Altho thro foreign climes I range
 I know her heart will never change
 For her bosom burns with honours glow
 My faithful Highland lassie O

 For her Ill dare the billows roar
 For her Ill trace a distant shore
 That Indian wealth may lustre throw
 Around my Highland lassie O

 She has my heart she has my hand
 By secret troth and honours band
 Till the mortal stroke shall lay me low
 Im thine my Highland lassie O

 Farewell the glen sae bushy O
 Farewell the plain sae rashy O
 To other lands I now must go
 To sing my Highland lassie O




Epistle To A Young Friend

 May __ 1786

 I Lang hae thought my youthfu friend
 A something to have sent you
 Tho it should serve nae ither end
 Than just a kind memento
 But how the subjecttheme may gang
 Let time and chance determine
 Perhaps it may turn out a sang
 Perhaps turn out a sermon

 Yell try the world soon my lad
 And Andrew dear believe me
 Yell find mankind an unco squad
 And muckle they may grieve ye
 For care and trouble set your thought
 Evn when your ends attained
 And a your views may come to nought
 Where evry nerve is strained

 Ill no say men are villains a
 The real hardend wicked
 Wha hae nae check but human law
 Are to a few restricked
 But Och mankind are unco weak
 An little to be trusted
 If self the wavering balance shake
 Its rarely right adjusted

 Yet they wha fa in fortunes strife
 Their fate we shouldna censure
 For still th important end of life
 They equally may answer
 A man may hae an honest heart
 Tho poortith hourly stare him
 A man may tak a neibors part
 Yet hae nae cash to spare him

 Aye free affhan your story tell
 When wi a bosom crony
 But still keep something to yoursel
 Ye scarcely tell to ony
 Conceal yoursel as weels ye can
 Frae critical dissection
 But keek thro evry other man
 Wi sharpend sly inspection

 The sacred lowe o weelplacd love
 Luxuriantly indulge it
 But never tempt th illicit rove
 Tho naething should divulge it
 I waive the quantum o the sin
 The hazard of concealing
 But Och it hardens a within
 And petrifies the feeling

 To catch dame Fortunes golden smile
 Assiduous wait upon her
 And gather gear by evry wile
 Thats justified by honour
 Not for to hide it in a hedge
 Nor for a train attendant
 But for the glorious privilege
 Of being independent

 The fear o hells a hangmans whip
 To haud the wretch in order
 But where ye feel your honour grip
 Let that aye be your border
 Its slightest touches instant pause
 Debar a sidepretences
 And resolutely keep its laws
 Uncaring consequences

 The great Creator to revere
 Must sure become the creature
 But still the preaching cant forbear
 And evn the rigid feature
 Yet neer with wits profane to range
 Be complaisance extended
 An atheistlaughs a poor exchange
 For Deity offended

 When ranting round in pleasures ring
 Religion may be blinded
 Or if she gie a random sting
 It may be little minded
 But when on life were tempest drivn
 A conscience but a canker
 A correspondence fixd wi Heavn
 Is sure a noble anchor

 Adieu dear amiable youth
 Your heart can neer be wanting
 May prudence fortitude and truth
 Erect your brow undaunting
 In ploughman phrase God send you speed
 Still daily to grow wiser
 And may ye better reck the rede
 Then ever did th adviser




Address Of Beelzebub

To the Right Honourable the Earl of Breadalbane President of the Right
Honourable and Honourable the Highland Society which met on the 23rd of
May last at the Shakespeare Covent Garden to concert ways and means to
frustrate the designs of five hundred Highlanders who as the Society
were informed by Mr MKenzie of Applecross were so audacious as to
attempt an escape from their lawful lords and masters whose property
they were by emigrating from the lands of Mr Macdonald of Glengary to
the wilds of Canada in search of that fantastic thingLiberty

 Long life my Lord an health be yours
 Unskaithed by hungerd Highland boors
 Lord grant me nae duddie desperate beggar
 Wi dirk claymore and rusty trigger
 May twin auld Scotland o a life
 She likesas butchers like a knife

 Faith you and Applecross were right
 To keep the Highland hounds in sight
 I doubt na they wad bid nae better
 Than let them ance out owre the water
 Then up among thae lakes and seas
 Theyll mak what rules and laws they please
 Some daring Hancocke or a Franklin
 May set their Highland bluid aranklin
 Some Washington again may head them
 Or some Montgomery fearless lead them
 Till God knows what may be effected
 When by such heads and hearts directed
 Poor dunghill sons of dirt and mire
 May to Patrician rights aspire
 Nae sage North now nor sager Sackville
 To watch and premier oer the pack vile
 An whare will ye get Howes and Clintons
 To bring them to a right repentance
 To cowe the rebel generation
 An save the honour o the nation
 They an be dd what right hae they
 To meat or sleep or light o day
 Far lessto riches powr or freedom
 But what your lordship likes to gie them

 But hear my lord Glengarry hear
 Your hands owre light to them I fear
 Your factors grieves trustees and bailies
 I canna say but they do gaylies
 They lay aside a tender mercies
 An tirl the hallions to the birses
 Yet while theyre only poindt and herriet
 Theyll keep their stubborn Highland spirit
 But smash them crash them a to spails
 An rot the dyvors i the jails
 The young dogs swinge them to the labour
 Let wark an hunger mak them sober
 The hizzies if theyre aughtlins fawsont
 Let them in Drurylane be lessond
 An if the wives an dirty brats
 Come thiggin at your doors an yetts
 Flaffin wi duds an grey wi beas
 Frightin away your ducks an geese
 Get out a horsewhip or a jowler
 The langest thong the fiercest growler
 An gar the tatterd gypsies pack
 Wi a their bastards on their back
 Go on my Lord I lang to meet you
 An in my house at hame to greet you
 Wi common lords ye shanna mingle
 The benmost neuk beside the ingle
 At my right han assigned your seat
 Tween Herods hip an Polycrate
 Or if you on your station tarrow
 Between Almagro and Pizarro
 A seat Im sure yere well deservint
 An till ye comeyour humble servant

A Dream

 Thoughts words and deeds the Statute blames with reason
 But surely Dreams were neer indicted Treason

On reading in the public papers the Laureates Ode with the other
parade of June 4th 1786 the Author was no sooner dropt asleep than he
imagined himself transported to the Birthday Levee and in his dreaming
fancy made the following Address

 GuidMornin to our Majesty
 May Heaven augment your blisses
 On evry new birthday ye see
 A humble poet wishes
 My bardship here at your Levee
 On sic a day as this is
 Is sure an uncouth sight to see
 Amang thae birthday dresses
 Sae fine this day

 I see yere complimented thrang
 By mony a lord an lady
 God save the King s a cuckoo sang
 Thats unco easy said aye
 The poets too a venal gang
 Wi rhymes weelturnd an ready
 Wad gar you trow ye neer do wrang
 But aye unerring steady
 On sic a day

 For me before a monarchs face
 Evn there I winna flatter
 For neither pension post nor place
 Am I your humble debtor
 So nae reflection on your Grace
 Your Kingship to bespatter
 Theres mony waur been o the race
 And aiblins ane been better
 Than you this day

 Tis very true my sovereign King
 My skill may weel be doubted
 But facts are chiels that winna ding
 An downa be disputed
 Your royal nest beneath your wing
 Is een right reft and clouted
 And now the third part o the string
 An less will gang aboot it
 Than did ae day1

 Far bet frae me that I aspire
 To blame your legislation
 Or say ye wisdom want or fire
 To rule this mighty nation
 But faith I muckle doubt my sire
 Yeve trusted ministration
 To chaps wha in barn or byre
 Wad better filld their station
 Than courts yon day

 And now yeve gien auld Britain peace
 Her broken shins to plaister
 Your sair taxation does her fleece
 Till she has scarce a tester
 For me thank God my lifes a lease
 Nae bargain wearin faster
 Or faith I fear that wi the geese
 I shortly boost to pasture
 I the craft some day

 Footnote 1 The American colonies had recently been lost

 Im no mistrusting Willie Pitt
 When taxes he enlarges
 An Wills a true guid fallows get
 A name not envy spairges
 That he intends to pay your debt
 An lessen a your charges
 But Godsake let nae saving fit
 Abridge your bonie barges
 Anboats this day

 Adieu my Liege may freedom geck
 Beneath your high protection
 An may ye rax Corruptions neck
 And gie her for dissection
 But since Im here Ill no neglect
 In loyal true affection
 To pay your Queen wi due respect
 May fealty an subjection
 This great birthday

 Hail Majesty most Excellent
 While nobles strive to please ye
 Will ye accept a compliment
 A simple poet gies ye
 Thae bonie bairntime Heavn has lent
 Still higher may they heeze ye
 In bliss till fate some day is sent
 For ever to release ye
 Frae care that day

 For you young Potentate oWales
 I tell your highness fairly
 Down Pleasures stream wi swelling sails
 Im tauld yere driving rarely
 But some day ye may gnaw your nails
 An curse your folly sairly
 That eer ye brak Dianas pales
 Or rattld dice wi Charlie
 By night or day

 Yet aft a ragged cowts been known
 To mak a noble aiver
 So ye may doucely fill the throne
 For atheir clishmaclaver
 There him2 at Agincourt wha shone
 Few better were or braver
 And yet wi funny queer Sir John3
 He was an unco shaver
 For mony a day

 For you right revrend Osnaburg
 Nane sets the lawnsleeve sweeter
 Altho a ribbon at your lug
 Wad been a dress completer
 As ye disown yon paughty dog
 That bears the keys of Peter
 Then swith an get a wife to hug
 Or trowth yell stain the mitre
 Some luckless day

 Young royal Tarrybreeks I learn
 Yeve lately come athwart her
 A glorious galley4 stem and stern
 Weel riggd for Venus barter
 But first hang out that shell discern
 Your hymeneal charter
 Then heave aboard your grapple airn
 An large upon her quarter
 Come full that day

 Ye lastly bonie blossoms a
 Ye royal lasses dainty
 Heavn mak you guid as well as braw
 An gie you lads aplenty
 But sneer na British boys awa
 For kings are unco scant aye
 An German gentles are but sma
 Theyre better just than want aye
 On ony day

 Footnote 4 Alluding to the newspaper account of a certain
 Royal sailors amourR B This was Prince William Henry
 third son of George III afterward King William IV

 Gad bless you a consider now
 Yere unco muckle dautit
 But ere the course o life be through
 It may be bitter sautit
 An I hae seen their coggie fou
 That yet hae tarrowt at it
 But or the day was done I trow
 The laggen they hae clautit
 Fu clean that day




A Dedication

 To Gavin Hamilton Esq

 Expect na sir in this narration
 A fleechin flethrin Dedication
 To roose you up an ca you guid
 An sprung o great an noble bluid
 Because yere surnamd like His Grace
 Perhaps related to the race
 Then when Im tirdand sae are ye
 Wi mony a fulsome sinfu lie
 Set up a face how I stop short
 For fear your modesty be hurt

 This may domaun do sir wi them wha
 Maun please the great folk for a wamefou
 For me sae laigh I need na bow
 For Lord be thankit I can plough
 And when I downa yoke a naig
 Then Lord be thankit I can beg
 Sae I shall sayan thats nae flattrin
 Its just sic Poet an sic Patron

 The Poet some guid angel help him
 Or else I fear some ill ane skelp him
 He may do weel for a hes done yet
 But onlyhes no just begun yet

 The Patron sir ye maun forgie me
 I winna lie come what will o me
 On evry hand it will allowd be
 Hes justnae better than he should be

 I readily and freely grant
 He downa see a poor man want
 Whats no his ain he winna tak it
 What ance he says he winna break it
 Ought he can lend hell no refust
 Till aft his guidness is abusd
 And rascals whiles that do him wrang
 Evn that he does na mind it lang
 As master landlord husband father
 He does na fail his part in either

 But then nae thanks to him for athat
 Nae godly symptom ye can ca that
 Its naething but a milder feature
 Of our poor sinfu corrupt nature
 Yell get the best o moral works
 Mang black Gentoos and pagan Turks
 Or hunters wild on Ponotaxi
 Wha never heard of orthodoxy
 That hes the poor mans friend in need
 The gentleman in word and deed
 Its no thro terror of damnation
 Its just a carnal inclination

 Morality thou deadly bane
 Thy tens o thousands thou hast slain
 Vain is his hope whase stay an trust is
 In moral mercy truth and justice

 Nostretch a point to catch a plack
 Abuse a brother to his back
 Steal through the winnock frae a whore
 But point the rake that taks the door
 Be to the poor like ony whunstane
 And haud their noses to the grunstane
 Ply evry art o legal thieving
 No matterstick to sound believing

 Learn threemile prayrs an halfmile graces
 Wi weelspread looves an lang wry faces
 Grunt up a solemn lengthend groan
 And damn a parties but your own
 Ill warrant they yere nae deceiver
 A steady sturdy staunch believer

 O ye wha leave the springs o Calvin
 For gumlie dubs of your ain delvin
 Ye sons of Heresy and Error
 Yell some day squeel in quaking terror
 When Vengeance draws the sword in wrath
 And in the fire throws the sheath
 When Ruin with his sweeping besom
 Just frets till Heavn commission gies him
 While oer the harp pale Misery moans
 And strikes the everdeepning tones
 Still louder shrieks and heavier groans

 Your pardon sir for this digression
 I maist forgat my Dedication
 But when divinity comes cross me
 My readers still are sure to lose me

 So sir you see twas nae daft vapour
 But I maturely thought it proper
 When a my works I did review
 To dedicate them sir to you
 Because ye need na tak it ill
 I thought them something like yoursel

 Then patronize them wi your favor
 And your petitioner shall ever
 I had amaist said ever pray
 But thats a word I need na say
 For prayin I hae little skill ot
 Im baith deadsweer an wretched ill ot
 But Ise repeat each poor mans prayr
 That kens or hears about you sir

 May neer Misfortunes gowling bark
 Howl thro the dwelling o the clerk
 May neer his genrous honest heart
 For that same genrous spirit smart
 May Kennedys farhonourd name
 Lang beet his hymeneal flame
 Till Hamiltons at least a dizzen
 Are frae their nuptial labours risen
 Five bonie lasses round their table
 And sevn braw fellows stout an able
 To serve their king an country weel
 By word or pen or pointed steel
 May health and peace with mutual rays
 Shine on the evning o his days
 Till his wee curlie Johns ieroe
 When ebbing life nae mair shall flow
 The last sad mournful rites bestow

 I will not wind a lang conclusion
 With complimentary effusion
 But whilst your wishes and endeavours
 Are blest with Fortunes smiles and favours
 I am dear sir with zeal most fervent
 Your much indebted humble servant

 But if which Powrs above prevent
 That ironhearted carl Want
 Attended in his grim advances
 By sad mistakes and black mischances
 While hopes and joys and pleasures fly him
 Make you as poor a dog as I am
 Your humble servant then no more
 For who would humbly serve the poor
 But by a poor mans hopes in Heavn
 While recollections powr is givn
 If in the vale of humble life
 The victim sad of fortunes strife
 I thro the tendergushing tear
 Should recognise my master dear
 If friendless low we meet together
 Then sir your handmy Friend and Brother




Versified Note To Dr Mackenzie Mauchline

 Friday firsts the day appointed
 By the Right Worshipful anointed

 To share the mercies wi you
 If Death then wi skaith then
 Some mortal heart is hechtin
 Inform him and storm him
 That Saturday youll fecht him

 Adieu a heartwarm fond adieu

 An stain them wi the saut saut tear
 Twill mak her poor auld heart I fear

 Lang mustering up a bitter blast
 A jillet brak his heart at last

 So took a berth afore the mast
 An owre the sea

 To tremble under Fortunes cummock
 On a scarce a bellyfu o drummock
 Wi his proud independent stomach

 So rowt his hurdies in a hammock

 Yet coin his pouches wad na bide in
 Wi him it neer was under hiding

 The Muse was a that he took pride in

 An hap him in cozie biel
 Yell find him aye a dainty chiel
 An fou o glee

 From thee Eliza I must go
 And from my native shore
 The cruel fates between us throw
 A boundless oceans roar
 But boundless oceans roaring wide
 Between my love and me
 They never never can divide
 My heart and soul from thee

 Farewell farewell Eliza dear
 The maid that I adore
 A boding voice is in mine ear
 We part to meet no more
 But the latest throb that leaves my heart
 While Death stands victor by
 That throb Eliza is thy part
 And thine that latest sigh




A Bards Epitaph

 Is there a whiminspired fool
 Owre fast for thought owre hot for rule
 Owre blate to seek owre proud to snool
 Let him draw near
 And owre this grassy heap sing dool
 And drap a tear

 Is there a bard of rustic song
 Who noteless steals the crowds among
 That weekly this area throng
 O pass not by
 But with a fraterfeeling strong
 Here heave a sigh

 Is there a man whose judgment clear
 Can others teach the course to steer
 Yet runs himself lifes mad career
 Wild as the wave
 Here pauseand thro the starting tear
 Survey this grave

 The poor inhabitant below
 Was quick to learn the wise to know
 And keenly felt the friendly glow
 And softer flame
 But thoughtless follies laid him low
 And staind his name

 Reader attend whether thy soul
 Soars fancys flights beyond the pole
 Or darkling grubs this earthly hole
 In low pursuit
 Know prudent cautious selfcontrol
 Is wisdoms root

 Know thou O stranger to the fame
 Of this much lovd much honoured name
 For none that knew him need be told
 A warmer heart death neer made cold

 Whom canting wretches blamd
 But with such as he whereer he be
 May I be savd or damnd

The Lass O Ballochmyle

 TuneEttrick Banks


 Twas eventhe dewy fields were green
 On every blade the pearls hang
 The zephyr wantond round the bean
 And bore its fragrant sweets alang
 In evry glen the mavis sang
 All nature listning seemd the while
 Except where greenwood echoes rang
 Amang the braes o Ballochmyle

 With careless step I onward strayd
 My heart rejoicd in natures joy
 When musing in a lonely glade
 A maiden fair I chancd to spy
 Her look was like the mornings eye
 Her air like natures vernal smile
 Perfection whisperd passing by
 Behold the lass o Ballochmyle

 Fair is the morn in flowery May
 And sweet is night in autumn mild
 When roving thro the garden gay
 Or wandring in the lonely wild
 But woman natures darling child
 There all her charms she does compile
 Even there her other works are foild
 By the bonie lass o Ballochmyle

 O had she been a country maid
 And I the happy country swain
 Tho shelterd in the lowest shed
 That ever rose on Scotlands plain
 Thro weary winters wind and rain
 With joy with rapture I would toil
 And nightly to my bosom strain
 The bonie lass o Ballochmyle

 Then pride might climb the slippry steep
 Where frame and honours lofty shine
 And thirst of gold might tempt the deep
 Or downward seek the Indian mine
 Give me the cot below the pine
 To tend the flocks or till the soil
 And evry day have joys divine
 With the bonie lass o Ballochmyle




Lines To An Old Sweetheart

 Once fondly lovd and still rememberd dear
 Sweet early object of my youthful vows
 Accept this mark of friendship warm sincere
 Friendship tis all cold duty now allows
 And when you read the simple artless rhymes
 One friendly sigh for himhe asks no more
 Who distant burns in flaming torrid climes
 Or haply lies beneath th Atlantic roar




Motto Prefixed To The Authors First Publication

 The simple Bard unbroke by rules of art
 He pours the wild effusions of the heart
 And if inspird tis Natures powrs inspire
 Hers all the melting thrill and hers the kindling fire




Lines To Mr John Kennedy

 Farewell dear friend may guid luck hit you
 And mang her favourites admit you
 If eer Detraction shore to smit you
 May nane believe him
 And ony deil that thinks to get you
 Good Lord deceive him




Lines Written On A Banknote

 Wae worth thy power thou cursed leaf
 Fell source o a my woe and grief
 For lack o thee Ive lost my lass
 For lack o thee I scrimp my glass
 I see the children of affliction
 Unaided through thy curst restriction
 Ive seen the oppressors cruel smile
 Amid his hapless victims spoil
 And for thy potence vainly wished
 To crush the villain in the dust
 For lack o thee I leave this muchlovd shore
 Never perhaps to greet old Scotland more

Stanzas On Naething

 Extempore Epistle to Gavin Hamilton Esq

 To you sir this summons Ive sent
 Pray whip till the pownie is freathing
 But if you demand what I want
 I honestly answer younaething

 Neer scorn a poor Poet like me
 For idly just living and breathing
 While people of every degree
 Are busy employed aboutnaething

 Poor Centumpercentum may fast
 And grumble his hurdies their claithing
 Hell find when the balance is cast
 Hes gane to the devil fornaething

 The courtier cringes and bows
 Ambition has likewise its plaything
 A coronet beams on his brows
 And what is a coronetnaething

 Some quarrel the Presbyter gown
 Some quarrel Episcopal graithing
 But every good fellow will own
 Their quarrel is a aboutnaething

 The lover may sparkle and glow
 Approaching his bonie bit gay thing
 But marriage will soon let him know
 Hes gottena buskit up naething

 The Poet may jingle and rhyme
 In hopes of a laureate wreathing
 And when he has wasted his time
 Hes kindly rewarded winaething

 The thundering bully may rage
 And swagger and swear like a heathen
 But collar him fast Ill engage
 Youll find that his courage isnaething

 Last night wi a feminine whig
 A Poet she couldna put faith in
 But soon we grew lovingly big
 I taught her her terrors were naething

 Her whigship was wonderful pleased
 But charmingly tickled wi ae thing
 Her fingers I lovingly squeezed
 And kissed her and promised hernaething

 The priest anathemas may threat
 Predicament sir that were baith in
 But when honours reveille is beat
 The holy artillerys naething

 And now I must mount on the wave
 My voyage perhaps there is death in
 But what is a watery grave
 The drowning a Poet is naething

 And now as grim deaths in my thought
 To you sir I make this bequeathing
 My service as long as yeve ought
 And my friendship by God when yeve naething




The Farewell

 The valiant in himself what can he suffer
 Or what does he regard his single woes
 But when alas he multiplies himself
 To dearer serves to the lovd tender fair
 To those whose bliss whose beings hang upon him
 To helpless childrenthen Oh then he feels
 The point of misery festering in his heart
 And weakly weeps his fortunes like a coward
 Such such am Iundone




Thomsons Edward and Eleanora

 Farewell old Scotias bleak domains
 Far dearer than the torrid plains
 Where rich ananas blow
 Farewell a mothers blessing dear
 A borthers sigh a sisters tear
 My Jeans heartrending throe
 Farewell my Bess tho thourt bereft
 Of my paternal care
 A faithful brother I have left
 My part in him thoult share
 Adieu too to you too
 My Smith my bosom frien
 When kindly you mind me
 O then befriend my Jean

 What bursting anguish tears my heart
 From thee my Jeany must I part
 Thou weeping answrestNo
 Alas misfortune stares my face
 And points to ruin and disgrace
 I for thy sake must go
 Thee Hamilton and Aiken dear
 A grateful warm adieu
 I with a muchindebted tear
 Shall still remember you
 All hail then the gale then
 Wafts me from thee dear shore
 It rustles and whistles
 Ill never see thee more




The Calf

To the Rev James Steven on his text Malachi ch iv vers 2 And ye
shall go forth and grow up as Calves of the stall

 Right sir your text Ill prove it true
 Tho heretics may laugh
 For instance theres yourself just now
 God knows an unco calf

 And should some patron be so kind
 As bless you wi a kirk
 I doubt na sir but then well find
 Yere still as great a stirk

 But if the lovers rapturd hour
 Shall ever be your lot
 Forbid it evry heavenly Power
 You eer should be a stot

 Tho when some kind connubial dear
 Your butandben adorns
 The like has been that you may wear
 A noble head of horns

 And in your lug most reverend James
 To hear you roar and rowt
 Few men o sense will doubt your claims
 To rank amang the nowt

 And when yere numberd wi the dead
 Below a grassy hillock
 With justice they may mark your head
 Here lies a famous bullock




Natures LawA Poem

 Humbly inscribed to Gavin Hamilton Esq

 Great Nature spoke observant man obeydPope


 Let other heroes boast their scars
 The marks of sturt and strife
 And other poets sing of wars
 The plagues of human life

 Shame fa the fun wi sword and gun
 To slap mankind like lumber
 I sing his name and nobler fame
 Wha multiplies our number

 Great Nature spoke with air benign
 Go on ye human race
 This lower world I you resign
 Be fruitful and increase
 The liquid fire of strong desire
 Ive pourd it in each bosom
 Here on this had does Mankind stand
 And there is Beautys blossom

 The Hero of these artless strains
 A lowly bard was he
 Who sung his rhymes in Coilas plains
 With meikle mirth anglee
 Kind Natures care had given his share
 Large of the flaming current
 And all devout he never sought
 To stem the sacred torrent

 He felt the powerful high behest
 Thrill vital thro and thro
 And sought a correspondent breast
 To give obedience due
 Propitious Powers screend the young flowrs
 From mildews of abortion
 And low the barda great reward
 Has got a double portion

 Auld cantie Coil may count the day
 As annual it returns
 The third of Libras equal sway
 That gave another Burns
 With future rhymes an other times
 To emulate his sire
 To sing auld Coil in nobler style
 With more poetic fire

 Ye Powers of peace and peaceful song
 Look down with gracious eyes
 And bless auld Coila large and long
 With multiplying joys
 Lang may she stand to prop the land
 The flowr of ancient nations
 And Burnses spring her fame to sing
 To endless generations

Mr Chalmers a gentleman in Ayrshire a particular friend of mine asked
me to write a poetic epistle to a young lady his Dulcinea I had seen her
but was scarcely acquainted with her and wrote as follows

 Wi braw new branks in mickle pride
 And eke a braw new brechan

 And up Parnassus pechin
 Whiles owre a bush wi donwward crush
 The doited beastie stammers
 Then up he gets and off he sets
 For sake o Willie Chalmers

 May cost a pair o blushes

 Nor his warm urged wishes
 Your bonie face sae mild and sweet
 His honest heart enamours
 And faith yell no be lost a whit
 Tho waird on Willie Chalmers

 Auld Truth hersel might swear yere fair
 And Honour safely back her
 And Modesty assume your air
 And neer a ane mistak her
 And sic twa loveinspiring een
 Might fire even holy palmers
 Nae wonder then theyve fatal been
 To honest Willie Chalmers

 I doubt na fortune may you shore
 Some mimmoud poutherd priestie
 Fu lifted up wi Hebrew lore
 And band upon his breastie
 But oh what signifies to you
 His lexicons and grammars
 The feeling hearts the royal blue
 And thats wi Willie Chalmers

 Some gapin glowrin countra laird
 May warsle for your favour
 May claw his lug and straik his beard
 And hoast up some palaver
 My bonie maid before ye wed
 Sic clumsywitted hammers
 Seek Heaven for help and barefit skelp
 Awa wi Willie Chalmers

 Forgive the Bard my fond regard
 For ane that shares my bosom
 Inspires my Muse to gie m his dues
 For deil a hair I roose him
 May powers aboon unite you soon
 And fructify your amours
 And every year come in mair dear
 To you and Willie Chalmers

 Come hither lad and answer fort

The Brigs Of Ayr

 A Poem

 Inscribed to John Ballantine Esq Ayr

 The simple Bard rough at the rustic plough
 Learning his tuneful trade from evry bough
 The chanting linnet or the mellow thrush
 Hailing the setting sun sweet in the green thorn bush
 The soaring lark the perching redbreast shrill
 Or deeptond plovers grey wildwhistling oer the hill
 Shall henurst in the peasants lowly shed
 To hardy independence bravely bred
 By early poverty to hardship steeld
 And traind to arms in stern Misfortunes field
 Shall he be guilty of their hireling crimes
 The servile mercenary Swiss of rhymes
 Or labour hard the panegyric close
 With all the venal soul of dedicating prose
 No though his artless strains he rudely sings
 And throws his hand uncouthly oer the strings
 He glows with all the spirit of the Bard
 Fame honest fame his great his dear reward
 Still if some patrons genrous care he trace
 Skilld in the secret to bestow with grace
 When Ballantine befriends his humble name
 And hands the rustic stranger up to fame
 With heartfelt throes his grateful bosom swells
 The godlike bliss to give alone excels

 Twas when the stacks get on their winter hap
 And thack and rape secure the toilwon crap
 Potatoebings are snugged up frae skaith
 O coming Winters biting frosty breath
 The bees rejoicing oer their summer toils
 Unnumberd buds an flowrs delicious spoils
 Seald up with frugal care in massive waxen piles
 Are doomd by Man that tyrant oer the weak
 The death o devils smoord wi brimstone reek
 The thundering guns are heard on evry side
 The wounded coveys reeling scatter wide
 The featherd fieldmates bound by Natures tie
 Sires mothers children in one carnage lie
 What warm poetic heart but inly bleeds
 And execrates mans savage ruthless deeds
 Nae mair the flowr in field or meadow springs
 Nae mair the grove with airy concert rings
 Except perhaps the Robins whistling glee
 Proud o the height o some bit halflang tree
 The hoary morns precede the sunny days
 Mild calm serene wide spreads the noontide blaze
 While thick the gosamour waves wanton in the rays

 Twas in that season when a simple Bard
 Unknown and poorsimplicitys reward
 Ae night within the ancient brugh of Ayr
 By whim inspird or haply prest wi care
 He left his bed and took his wayward route
 And down by Simpsons1 wheeld the left about
 Whether impelld by alldirecting Fate
 To witness what I after shall narrate
 Or whether rapt in meditation high
 He wanderd out he knew not where or why
 The drowsy Dungeonclock2 had numberd two
 and Wallace Tower2 had sworn the fact was true
 The tideswoln firth with sullensounding roar
 Through the still night dashd hoarse along the shore
 All else was hushd as Natures closed ee
 The silent moon shone high oer tower and tree
 The chilly frost beneath the silver beam
 Crept gentlycrusting oer the glittering stream
 When lo on either hand the listning Bard
 The clanging sugh of whistling wings is heard
 Two dusky forms dart through the midnight air
 Swift as the gos3 drives on the wheeling hare
 Ane on th Auld Brig his airy shape uprears
 The other flutters oer the rising piers
 Our warlock Rhymer instantly dexcried
 The Sprites that owre the Brigs of Ayr preside
 That Bards are secondsighted is nae joke
 And ken the lingo of the spritual folk
 Fays Spunkies Kelpies a they can explain them
 And even the very deils they brawly ken them
 Auld Brig appeard of ancient Pictish race
 The very wrinkles Gothic in his face
 He seemd as he wi Time had warstld lang
 Yet teughly doure he bade an unco bang

 New Brig was buskit in a braw new coat
 That he at Lonon frae ane Adams got
 In s hand five taper staves as smooth s a bead
 Wi virls and whirlygigums at the head
 The Goth was stalking round with anxious search
 Spying the timeworn flaws in every arch
 It chancd his newcome neibor took his ee
 And een a vexed and angry heart had he
 Wi thieveless sneer to see his modish mien
 He down the water gies him this guideen



 Auld Brig

 I doubt na frien yell think yere nae sheepshank
 Ance ye were streekit owre frae bank to bank
 But gin ye be a brig as auld as me
 Tho faith that date I doubt yell never see
 Therell be if that day come Ill wad a boddle
 Some fewer whigmaleeries in your noddle



 New Brig

 Auld Vandal ye but show your little mense
 Just much about it wi your scanty sense
 Will your poor narrow footpath of a street
 Where twa wheelbarrows tremble when they meet
 Your ruind formless bulk o stane and lime
 Compare wi bonie brigs o modern time
 Theres men of taste woud tak the Ducat stream4
 Tho they should cast the very sark and swim
 Eer they would grate their feelings wi the view
 O sic an ugly Gothic hulk as you



 Auld Brig

 Conceited gowk puffd up wi windy pride
 This mony a year Ive stood the flood an tide
 And tho wi crazy eild Im sair forfairn
 Ill be a brig when yere a shapeless cairn
 As yet ye little ken about the matter
 But twathree winters will inform ye better
 When heavy dark continued aday rains

 Footnote 4 A noted ford just above the Auld BrigR B

 Wi deepening deluges oerflow the plains
 When from the hills where springs the brawling Coil
 Or stately Lugars mossy fountains boil
 Or where the Greenock winds his moorland course
 Or haunted Garpal draws his feeble source
 Aroused by blustering winds an spotting thowes
 In mony a torrent down the snawbroo rowes
 While crashing ice borne on the rolling spate
 Sweeps dams an mills an brigs a to the gate
 And from Glenbuck5 down to the Rattonkey6
 Auld Ayr is just one lengthend tumbling sea
 Then down yell hurl deil nor ye never rise
 And dash the gumlie jaups up to the pouring skies
 A lesson sadly teaching to your cost
 That Architectures noble art is lost



 New Brig

 Fine architecture trowth I needs must sayt ot
 The Lord be thankit that weve tint the gate ot
 Gaunt ghastly ghaistalluring edifices
 Hanging with threatning jut like precipices
 Oerarching mouldy gloominspiring coves
 Supporting roofs fantastic stony groves
 Windows and doors in nameless sculptures drest
 With order symmetry or taste unblest
 Forms like some bedlam Statuarys dream
 The crazd creations of misguided whim
 Forms might be worshippd on the bended knee
 And still the second dread command be free
 Their likeness is not found on earth in air or sea
 Mansions that would disgrace the building taste
 Of any mason reptile bird or beast
 Fit only for a doited monkish race
 Or frosty maids forsworn the dear embrace
 Or cuifs of later times wha held the notion
 That sullen gloom was sterling true devotion
 Fancies that our guid Brugh denies protection
 And soon may they expire unblest wi resurrection

 Auld Brig

 O ye my dearrememberd ancient yealings
 Were ye but here to share my wounded feelings
 Ye worthy Proveses an mony a Bailie
 Wha in the paths o righteousness did toil aye
 Ye dainty Deacons and ye douce Conveners
 To whom our moderns are but causeycleaners
 Ye godly Councils wha hae blest this town
 ye godly Brethren o the sacred gown
 Wha meekly gie your hurdies to the smiters
 And what would now be strange ye godly Writers
 A ye douce folk Ive borne aboon the broo
 Were ye but here what would ye say or do
 How would your spirits groan in deep vexation
 To see each melancholy alteration
 And agonising curse the time and place
 When ye begat the base degenrate race
 Nae langer revrend men their countrys glory
 In plain braid Scots hold forth a plain braid story
 Nae langer thrifty citizens an douce
 Meet owre a pint or in the Councilhouse
 But staumrel corkyheaded graceless Gentry
 The herryment and ruin of the country
 Men threeparts made by tailors and by barbers
 Wha waste your weelhaind gear on damnd new brigs and harbours



 New Brig

 Now haud you there for faith yeve said enough
 And muckle mair than ye can mak to through
 As for your Priesthood I shall say but little
 Corbies and Clergy are a shot right kittle
 But under favour o your langer beard
 Abuse o Magistrates might weel be spard
 To liken them to your auldwarld squad
 I must needs say comparisons are odd
 In Ayr wagwits nae mair can hae a handle
 To mouth a Citizen a term o scandal
 Nae mair the Council waddles down the street
 In all the pomp of ignorant conceit
 Men wha grew wise priggin owre hops and raisins
 Or gatherd libral views in Bonds and Seisins
 If haply Knowledge on a random tramp
 Had shord them with a glimmer of his lamp
 And would to Commonsense for once betrayd them
 Plain dull Stupidity stept kindly in to aid them

 What farther clishmaclaver aight been said
 What bloody wars if Sprites had blood to shed
 No man can tell but all before their sight
 A fairy train appeard in order bright
 Adown the glittering stream they featly dancd
 Bright to the moon their various dresses glancd
 They footed oer the watry glass so neat
 The infant ice scarce bent beneath their feet
 While arts of Minstrelsy among them rung
 And soulennobling Bards heroic ditties sung

 O had MLauchlan7 thairminspiring sage
 Been there to hear this heavenly band engage
 When thro his dear strathspeys they bore with Highland rage
 Or when they struck old Scotias melting airs
 The lovers raptured joys or bleeding cares
 How would his Highland lug been nobler fird
 And evn his matchless hand with finer touch inspird
 No guess could tell what instrument appeard
 But all the soul of Musics self was heard
 Harmonious concert rung in every part
 While simple melody pourd moving on the heart
 The Genius of the Stream in front appears
 A venerable Chief advancd in years
 His hoary head with waterlilies crownd
 His manly leg with gartertangle bound
 Next came the loveliest pair in all the ring
 Sweet female Beauty hand in hand with Spring
 Then crownd with flowry hay came Rural Joy
 And Summer with his fervidbeaming eye

 Footnote 7 A wellknown performer of Scottish music on the
 violinR B

 Allcheering Plenty with her flowing horn
 Led yellow Autumn wreathd with nodding corn
 Then Winters timebleachd locks did hoary show
 By Hospitality with cloudless brow
 Next followed Courage with his martial stride
 From where the Feal wildwoody coverts hide8
 Benevolence with mild benignant air
 A female form came from the towrs of Stair9
 Learning and Worth in equal measures trode
 From simple Catrine their longlovd abode10
 Last whiterobd Peace crownd with a hazel wreath
 To rustic Agriculture did bequeath
 The broken iron instruments of death
 At sight of whom our Sprites forgat their kindling wrath




Fragment Of Song

 The night was still and oer the hill
 The moon shone on the castle wa
 The mavis sang while dewdrops hang
 Around her on the castle wa
 Sae merrily they danced the ring
 Frae eenin till the cock did craw
 And aye the oerword o the spring
 Was Irvines bairns are bonie a

PrayerO Thou Dread Power

Lying at a reverend friends house one night the author left the
following verses in the room where he slept

 O Thou dread Power who reignst above
 I know thou wilt me hear
 When for this scene of peace and love
 I make this prayer sincere

 The hoary Sirethe mortal stroke
 Long long be pleasd to spare
 To bless this little filial flock
 And show what good men are

 She who her lovely offspring eyes
 With tender hopes and fears
 O bless her with a mothers joys
 But spare a mothers tears

 Their hope their stay their darling youth
 In manhoods dawning blush
 Bless him Thou God of love and truth
 Up to a parents wish

 The beauteous seraph sisterband
 With earnest tears I pray
 Thou knowst the snares on evry hand
 Guide Thou their steps alway

 When soon or late they reach that coast
 Oer Lifes rough ocean driven
 May they rejoice no wandrer lost
 A family in Heaven




Farewell Song To The Banks Of Ayr

 TuneRoslin Castle

I composed this song as I conveyed my chest so far on my road to
Greenock where I was to embark in a few days for Jamaica I meant it as my
farewell dirge to my native landR B

 The gloomy night is gathring fast
 Loud roars the wild inconstant blast
 Yon murky cloud is foul with rain
 I see it driving oer the plain
 The hunter now has left the moor
 The scattred coveys meet secure
 While here I wander prest with care
 Along the lonely banks of Ayr

 The Autumn mourns her ripning corn
 By early Winters ravage torn
 Across her placid azure sky
 She sees the scowling tempest fly
 Chill runs my blood to hear it rave
 I think upon the stormy wave
 Where many a danger I must dare
 Far from the bonie banks of Ayr

 Tis not the surging billows roar
 Tis not that fatal deadly shore
 Tho death in evry shape appear
 The wretched have no more to fear
 But round my heart the ties are bound
 That heart transpiercd with many a wound
 These bleed afresh those ties I tear
 To leave the bonie banks of Ayr

 Farewell old Coilas hills and dales
 Her healthy moors and winding vales
 The scenes where wretched Fancy roves
 Pursuing past unhappy loves
 Farewell my friends farewell my foes
 My peace with these my love with those
 The bursting tears my heart declare
 Farewell the bonie banks of Ayr




Address To The Toothache

 My curse upon your venomd stang
 That shoots my torturd gums alang
 An thro my lug gies mony a twang
 Wi gnawing vengeance
 Tearing my nerves wi bitter pang
 Like racking engines

 When fevers burn or argues freezes
 Rheumatics gnaw or colics squeezes
 Our neibors sympathy can ease us
 Wi pitying moan
 But theethou hell o a diseases
 Aye mocks our groan

 Adown my beard the slavers trickle
 I throw the wee stools oer the mickle
 While round the fire the giglets keckle
 To see me loup
 While raving mad I wish a heckle
 Were in their doup

 In a the numerous human dools
 Ill hairsts daft bargains cutty stools
 Or worthy friens rakd i the mools
 Sad sight to see
 The tricks o knaves or fash ofools
 Thou bearst the gree

 Whereer that place be priests ca hell
 Where a the tones o misery yell
 An ranked plagues their numbers tell
 In dreadfu raw
 Thou Toothache surely bearst the bell
 Amang them a

 O thou grim mischiefmaking chiel
 That gars the notes o discord squeel
 Till daft mankind aft dance a reel
 In gore a shoethick
 Gie a the faes o Scotlands weal
 A townmonds toothache




Lines On Meeting With Lord Daer1

 A neertobeforgotten day
 Sae far I sprackld up the brae
 I dinnerd wi a Lord

 Ive been at drucken writers feasts
 Nay been bitchfou mang godly priests
 Wi revrence be it spoken
 Ive even joind the honourd jorum
 When mighty Squireships of the quorum
 Their hydra drouth did sloken

 But wi a Lordstand out my shin
 A Lorda Peeran Earls son
 Up higher yet my bonnet
 An sic a Lordlang Scoth ells twa
 Our Peerage he oerlooks them a
 As I look oer my sonnet

 But O for Hogarths magic powr
 To show Sir Bardies willyart glowr
 An how he stard and stammerd
 When goavin as if led wi branks
 An stumpin on his ploughman shanks
 He in the parlour hammerd

 I sidying shelterd in a nook
 An at his Lordship stealt a look
 Like some portentous omen
 Except good sense and social glee
 An what surprisd me modesty
 I marked nought uncommon

 I watchd the symptoms o the Great
 The gentle pride the lordly state
 The arrogant assuming
 The fient a pride nae pride had he
 Nor sauce nor state that I could see
 Mair than an honest ploughman

 Then from his Lordship I shall learn
 Henceforth to meet with unconcern
 One rank as weels another
 Nae honest worthy man need care
 To meet with noble youthful Daer
 For he but meets a brother




Masonic Song

 TuneShawnboy or Over the water to Charlie


 Ye sons of old Killie assembled by Willie
 To follow the noble vocation
 Your thrifty old mother has scarce such another
 To sit in that honoured station
 Ive little to say but only to pray
 As prayings the ton of your fashion
 A prayer from thee Muse you well may excuse
 Tis seldom her favourite passion

 Ye powers who preside oer the wind and the tide
 Who marked each elements border
 Who formed this frame with beneficent aim
 Whose sovereign statute is order
 Within this dear mansion may wayward Contention
 Or withered Envy neer enter
 May secrecy round be the mystical bound
 And brotherly Love be the centre

 An aye the tither shot he thumpit
 Till coward Death behind him jumpit
 Wi deadly feid
 Now he proclaims wi tout o trumpet
 Tam Samsons dead

 When at his heart he felt the dagger
 He reeld his wonted bottleswagger
 But yet he drew the mortal trigger
 Wi weelaimed heed
 Lord five he cryd an owre did stagger
 Tam Samsons dead

 Ilk hoary hunter mournd a brither
 Ilk sportsman youth bemoand a father
 Yon auld gray stane amang the heather
 Marks out his head
 Whare Burns has wrote in rhyming blether
 Tam Samsons dead

 There low he lies in lasting rest
 Perhaps upon his mouldring breast
 Some spitefu muirfowl bigs her nest
 To hatch an breed
 Alas nae mair hell them molest
 Tam Samsons dead

 When August winds the heather wave
 And sportsmen wander by yon grave
 Three volleys let his memory crave
 O pouther an lead
 Till Echo answer frae her cave
 Tam Samsons dead

 Heavn rest his saul whareer he be
 Is th wish o mony mae than me
 He had twa fauts or maybe three
 Yet what remead
 Ae social honest man want we
 Tam Samsons dead




The Epitaph

 Tam Samsons weelworn clay here lies
 Ye canting zealots spare him
 If honest worth in Heaven rise
 Yell mend or ye win near him

 Thro a the streets an neuks o Killie3
 Tell evry social honest billie
 To cease his grievin
 For yet unskaithed by Deaths gleg gullie

 Until you on a crummock driddle

 Heaven send your heartstrings aye in tune
 And screw your temperpins aboon

Fragment On Sensibility

 Rusticitys ungainly form
 May cloud the highest mind
 But when the heart is nobly warm
 The good excuse will find

 Proprietys cold cautious rules
 Warm fervour may oerlook
 But spare poor sensibility
 Th ungentle harsh rebuke




A Winter Night

 Poor naked wretches wheresoeer you are
 That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm
 How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides
 Your loopd and windowd raggedness defend you
 From seasons such as theseShakespeare

 When biting Boreas fell and dour
 Sharp shivers thro the leafless bowr
 When Phoebus gies a shortlivd glowr
 Far south the lift
 Dimdarkning thro the flaky showr
 Or whirling drift

 Ae night the storm the steeples rocked
 Poor Labour sweet in sleep was locked
 While burns wi snawy wreaths upchoked
 Wildeddying swirl
 Or thro the mining outlet bocked
 Down headlong hurl

 Listning the doors an winnocks rattle
 I thought me on the ourie cattle
 Or silly sheep wha bide this brattle
 O winter war
 And thro the drift deeplairing sprattle
 Beneath a scar

 Ilk happing birdwee helpless thing
 That in the merry months o spring
 Delighted me to hear thee sing
 What comes o thee
 Whare wilt thou cowr thy chittering wing
 An close thy ee

 Evn you on murdering errands toild
 Lone from your savage homes exild
 The bloodstaind roost and sheepcote spoild
 My heart forgets
 While pityless the tempest wild
 Sore on you beats

 Now Phoebe in her midnight reign
 Darkmuffd viewd the dreary plain
 Still crowding thoughts a pensive train
 Rose in my soul
 When on my ear this plantive strain
 Slow solemn stole

 Blow blow ye winds with heavier gust
 And freeze thou bitterbiting frost
 Descend ye chilly smothering snows
 Not all your rage as now united shows
 More hard unkindness unrelenting
 Vengeful malice unrepenting
 Than heavenillumind Man on brother Man bestows

 See stern Oppressions iron grip
 Or mad Ambitions gory hand
 Sending like bloodhounds from the slip
 Woe Want and Murder oer a land
 Evn in the peaceful rural vale
 Truth weeping tells the mournful tale
 How pamperd Luxury Flattry by her side
 The parasite empoisoning her ear
 With all the servile wretches in the rear
 Looks oer proud Property extended wide
 And eyes the simple rustic hind
 Whose toil upholds the glittring show
 A creature of another kind
 Some coarser substance unrefind
 Placd for her lordly use thus far thus vile below

 Where where is Loves fond tender throe
 With lordly Honours lofty brow
 The powrs you proudly own
 Is there beneath Loves noble name
 Can harbour dark the selfish aim
 To bless himself alone
 Mark maideninnocence a prey
 To lovepretending snares
 This boasted Honour turns away
 Shunning soft Pitys rising sway
 Regardless of the tears and unavailing prayrs
 Perhaps this hour in Miserys squalid nest
 She strains your infant to her joyless breast
 And with a mothers fears shrinks at the rocking blast

 Oh ye who sunk in beds of down
 Feel not a want but what yourselves create
 Think for a moment on his wretched fate
 Whom friends and fortune quite disown
 Illsatisfyd keen natures clamorous call
 Stretchd on his straw he lays himself to sleep
 While through the ragged roof and chinky wall
 Chill oer his slumbers piles the drifty heap
 Think on the dungeons grim confine
 Where Guilt and poor Misfortune pine
 Guilt erring man relenting view
 But shall thy legal rage pursue
 The wretch already crushed low
 By cruel Fortunes undeserved blow
 Afflictions sons are brothers in distress
 A brother to relieve how exquisite the bliss

 I heard nae mair for Chanticleer
 Shook off the pouthery snaw
 And haild the morning with a cheer
 A cottagerousing craw
 But deep this truth impressd my mind
 Thro all His works abroad
 The heart benevolent and kind
 The most resembles God




SongYon Wild Mossy Mountains

 Yon wild mossy mountains sae lofty and wide
 That nurse in their bosom the youth o the Clyde
 Where the grouse lead their coveys thro the heather to feed
 And the shepherd tends his flock as he pipes on his reed

 Not Gowries rich valley nor Forths sunny shores
 To me hae the charms oyon wild mossy moors
 For there by a lanely sequestered stream
 Besides a sweet lassie my thought and my dream

 Amang thae wild mountains shall still be my path
 Ilk stream foaming down its ain green narrow strath
 For there wi my lassie the day lang I rove
 While oer us unheeded flie the swift hours olove

 She is not the fairest altho she is fair
 O nice education but sma is her share
 Her parentage humble as humble can be
 But I loe the dear lassie because she loes me

 To Beauty what man but maun yield him a prize
 In her armour of glances and blushes and sighs
 And when wit and refinement hae polishd her darts
 They dazzle our een as they flie to our hearts

 But kindness sweet kindness in the fondsparkling ee
 Has lustre outshining the diamond to me
 And the heart beating love as Im claspd in her arms
 O these are my lassies allconquering charms




Address To Edinburgh

 Edina Scotias darling seat
 All hail thy palaces and towrs
 Where once beneath a Monarchs feet
 Sat Legislations sovreign powrs
 From marking wildly scattred flowrs
 As on the banks of Ayr I strayd
 And singing lone the lingering hours
 I shelter in they honourd shade

 Here Wealth still swells the golden tide
 As busy Trade his labours plies
 There Architectures noble pride
 Bids elegance and splendour rise
 Here Justice from her native skies
 High wields her balance and her rod
 There Learning with his eagle eyes
 Seeks Science in her coy abode

 Thy sons Edina social kind
 With open arms the stranger hail
 Their views enlargd their liberal mind
 Above the narrow rural vale
 Attentive still to Sorrows wail
 Or modest Merits silent claim
 And never may their sources fail
 And never Envy blot their name

 Thy daughters bright thy walks adorn
 Gay as the gilded summer sky
 Sweet as the dewy milkwhite thorn
 Dear as the rapturd thrill of joy
 Fair Burnet strikes th adoring eye
 Heavens beauties on my fancy shine
 I see the Sire of Love on high
 And own His work indeed divine

 There watching high the least alarms
 Thy rough rude fortress gleams afar
 Like some bold veteran grey in arms
 And markd with many a seamy scar
 The pondrous wall and massy bar
 Grimrising oer the rugged rock
 Have oft withstood assailing war
 And oft repelld th invaders shock

 With awestruck thought and pitying tears
 I view that noble stately Dome
 Where Scotias kings of other years
 Famd heroes had their royal home
 Alas how changd the times to come
 Their royal name low in the dust
 Their hapless race wildwandring roam
 Tho rigid Law cries out twas just

 Wild beats my heart to trace your steps
 Whose ancestors in days of yore
 Thro hostile ranks and ruind gaps
 Old Scotias bloody lion bore
 Evn I who sing in rustic lore
 Haply my sires have left their shed
 And facd grim Dangers loudest roar
 Boldfollowing where your fathers led

 Edina Scotias darling seat
 All hail thy palaces and towrs
 Where once beneath a Monarchs feet
 Sat Legislations sovereign powrs
 From marking wildlyscattred flowrs
 As on the banks of Ayr I strayd
 And singing lone the lingring hours
 I shelter in thy honourd shade

 Great chieftain o the puddingrace
 Aboon them a yet tak your place
 Painch tripe or thairm

 The groaning trencher there ye fill
 Your hurdies like a distant hill
 Your pin was help to mend a mill
 In time oneed
 While thro your pores the dews distil
 Like amber bead

 An cut you up wi ready sleight
 Trenching your gushing entrails bright
 Like ony ditch
 And then O what a glorious sight

 Then horn for horn they stretch an strive
 Deil tak the hindmost on they drive
 Till a their weelswalld kytes belyve
 Are bent like drums
 Then auld Guidman maist like to rive
 Bethankit hums

 Is there that owre his French ragout
 Or olio that wad staw a sow
 Or fricassee wad make her spew
 Wi perfect sconner
 Looks down wi sneering scornfu view
 On sic a dinner

 Poor devil see him owre his trash
 As feckles as witherd rash
 His spindle shank a guid whiplash
 His nieve a nit
 Thro blody flood or field to dash
 O how unfit

 But mark the Rustic haggisfed
 The trembling earth resounds his tread
 Clap in his walie nieve a blade
 Hell mak it whissle
 An legs an arms an hands will sned
 Like taps o trissle

 Ye Powrs wha mak mankind your care
 And dish them out their bill o fare
 Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware
 That jaups in luggies
 But if ye wish her gratefu prayer
 Gie her a haggis

To Miss Logan With Beatties Poems For A NewYears Gift Jan 1 1787

 Again the silent wheels of time
 Their annual round have driven
 And you tho scarce in maiden prime
 Are so much nearer Heaven

 No gifts have I from Indian coasts
 The infant year to hail
 I send you more than India boasts
 In Edwins simple tale

 Our sex with guile and faithless love
 Is chargd perhaps too true
 But may dear maid each lover prove
 An Edwin still to you

 Shrewd Willie Smellie to Crochallan came
 The old cockd hat the grey surtout the same
 His bristling beard just rising in its might
 Twas four long nights and days to shaving night
 His uncombd grizzly locks wild staring thatchd
 A head for thought profound and clear unmatchd
 Yet tho his caustic wit was bitingrude
 His heart was warm benevolent and good

 An Ill cleed thee in the tartan sae fine

Inscription For The Headstone Of Fergusson The Poet1

 No sculptured marble here nor pompous lay
 No storied urn nor animated bust
 This simple stone directs pale Scotias way
 To pour her sorrows oer the Poets dust


 Additional Stanzas

 She mourns sweet tuneful youth thy hapless fate
 Tho all the powers of song thy fancy fired
 Yet Luxury and Wealth lay by in state
 And thankless starvd what they so much admired

 This tribute with a tear now gives
 A brother Bardhe can no more bestow
 But dear to fame thy Song immortal lives
 A nobler monument than Art can shew


 Inscribed Under Fergussons Portrait

 Curse on ungrateful man that can be pleased
 And yet can starve the author of the pleasure
 O thou my elder brother in misfortune
 By far my elder brother in the Muses
 With tears I pity thy unhappy fate
 Why is the Bard unpitied by the world
 Yet has so keen a relish of its pleasures

Epistle To Mrs Scott

 Gudewife of WauchopeHouse Roxburghshire


 Gudewife

 I Mind it weel in early date
 When I was bardless young and blate
 An first could thresh the barn
 Or haud a yokin at the pleugh
 An tho forfoughten sair eneugh
 Yet unco proud to learn
 When first amang the yellow corn
 A man I reckond was
 An wi the lave ilk merry morn
 Could rank my rig and lass
 Still shearing and clearing
 The tither stooked raw
 Wi claivers an haivers
 Wearing the day awa

 Een then a wish I mind its powr
 A wish that to my latest hour
 Shall strongly heave my breast
 That I for poor auld Scotlands sake
 Some usefu plan or book could make
 Or sing a sang at least
 The rough burrthistle spreading wide
 Amang the bearded bear
 I turnd the weederclips aside
 An spard the symbol dear
 No nation no station
 My envy eer could raise
 A Scot still but blot still
 I knew nae higher praise

 But still the elements o sang
 In formless jumble right an wrang
 Wild floated in my brain
 Till on that harst I said before
 May partner in the merry core
 She rousd the forming strain
 I see her yet the sonsie quean
 That lighted up my jingle
 Her witching smile her pawky een
 That gart my heartstrings tingle
 I fired inspired
 At every kindling keek
 But bashing and dashing
 I feared aye to speak

 Health to the sex ilk guid chiel says
 Wi merry dance in winter days
 An we to share in common
 The gust o joy the balm of woe
 The saul o life the heaven below
 Is rapturegiving woman
 Ye surly sumphs who hate the name
 Be mindfu o your mither
 She honest woman may think shame
 That yere connected with her
 Yere wae men yere nae men
 That slight the lovely dears
 To shame ye disclaim ye
 Ilk honest birkie swears

 For you no bred to barn and byre
 Wha sweetly tune the Scottish lyre
 Thanks to you for your line
 The marled plaid ye kindly spare
 By me should gratefully be ware
 Twad please me to the nine
 Id be mair vauntie o my hap
 Douce hingin owre my curple
 Than ony ermine ever lap
 Or proud imperial purple
 Farewell then lang hale then
 An plenty be your fa
 May losses and crosses
 Neer at your hallan ca

Verses Intended To Be Written Below A Noble Earls Picture1

 Whose is that noble dauntless brow
 And whose that eye of fire
 And whose that generous princely mien
 Een rooted foes admire

 Stranger to justly show that brow
 And mark that eye of fire
 Would take His hand whose vernal tints
 His other works admire

 Bright as a cloudless summer sun
 With stately port he moves
 His guardian Seraph eyes with awe
 The noble Ward he loves

 Among the illustrious Scottish sons
 That chief thou mayst discern
 Mark Scotias fondreturning eye
 It dwells upon Glencairn




Prologue

 Spoken by Mr Woods on his benefitnight Monday 16th April 1787

 When by a generous Publics kind acclaim
 That dearest meed is grantedhonest fame
 Waen here your favour is the actors lot
 Nor even the man in private life forgot
 What breast so dead to heavenly Virtues glow
 But heaves impassiond with the grateful throe

 Poor is the task to please a barbrous throng
 It needs no Siddons powers in Southerns song
 But here an ancient nation famd afar
 For genius learning high as great in war
 Hail Caledonia name for ever dear
 Before whose sons Im honourd to appear

 Footnote 1 The Nobleman is James Fourteenth Earl of Glencairn

 Where every science every nobler art
 That can inform the mind or mend the heart
 Is known as grateful nations oft have found
 Far as the rude barbarian marks the bound
 Philosophy no idle pedant dream
 Here holds her search by heaventaught Reasons beam
 Here History paints with elegance and force
 The tide of Empires fluctuating course
 Here Douglas forms wild Shakespeare into plan
 And Harley rouses all the God in man
 When wellformd taste and sparkling wit unite
 With manly lore or female beauty bright
 Beauty where faultless symmetry and grace
 Can only charm us in the second place
 Witness my heart how oft with panting fear
 As on this night Ive met these judges here
 But still the hope Experience taught to live
 Equal to judgeyoure candid to forgive
 No hundredheaded riot here we meet
 With decency and law beneath his feet
 Nor Insolence assumes fair Freedoms name
 Like Caledonians you applaud or blame

 O Thou dread Power whose empiregiving hand
 Has oft been stretchd to shield the honourd land
 Strong may she glow with all her ancient fire
 May every son be worthy of his sire
 Firm may she rise with generous disdain
 At Tyrannys or direr Pleasures chain
 Still Selfdependent in her native shore
 Bold may she brave grim Dangers loudest roar
 Till Fate the curtain drop on worlds to be no more




The Bonie MoorHen

 The heather was blooming the meadows were mawn
 Our lads gaed ahunting ae day at the dawn
 Oer moors and oer mosses and mony a glen
 At length they discoverd a bonie moorhen

 ChorusI rede you beware at the hunting young men
 I rede you beware at the hunting young men
 Take some on the wing and some as they spring
 But cannily steal on a bonie moorhen

 Sweetbrushing the dew from the brown heather bells
 Her colours betrayd her on yon mossy fells
 Her plumage outlustrd the pride o the spring
 And O as she wantond sae gay on the wing
 I rede you c

 Auld Phoebus himself as he peepd oer the hill
 In spite at her plumage he tried his skill
 He levelld his rays where she baskd on the brae
 His rays were outshone and but markd where she lay
 I rede youc

 They hunted the valley they hunted the hill
 The best of our lads wi the best o their skill
 But still as the fairest she sat in their sight
 Then whirr she was over a mile at a flight
 I rede you c

 But the lassie than a man loes best
 O thats the lass to mak him blest

Address To Wm Tytler Esq Of Woodhouselee

 With an Impression of the Authors Portrait

 Revered defender of beauteous Stuart
 Of Stuart a name once respected
 A name which to love was the mark of a true heart
 But now tis despisd and neglected

 Tho something like moisture conglobes in my eye
 Let no one misdeem me disloyal
 A poor friendless wandrer may well claim a sigh
 Still more if that wandrer were royal

 My fathers that name have reverd on a throne
 My fathers have fallen to right it
 Those fathers would spurn their degenerate son
 That name should he scoffingly slight it

 Still in prayers for King George I most heartily join
 The Queen and the rest of the gentry
 Be they wise be they foolish is nothing of mine
 Their titles avowd by my country

 But why of that epocha make such a fuss
 That gave us th Electoral stem
 If bringing them over was lucky for us
 Im sure twas as lucky for them

 But loyalty truce were on dangerous ground
 Who knows how the fashions may alter
 The doctrine today that is loyalty sound
 Tomorrow may bring us a halter

 I send you a trifle a head of a bard
 A trifle scarce worthy your care
 But accept it good Sir as a mark of regard
 Sincere as a saints dying prayer

 Now lifes chilly evening dim shades on your eye
 And ushers the long dreary night
 But you like the star that athwart gilds the sky
 Your course to the latest is bright




Epigram To Miss Ainslie In Church

 Who was looking up the text during sermon

 Fair maid you need not take the hint
 Nor idle texts pursue

 Nae joy her bonie buskit nest

 Auld Reekie aye he keepit tight

 The stiffest o them a he bowd
 The bauldest o them a he cowd
 They durst nae mair than he allowd
 That was a law
 Weve lost a birkie weel worth gowd

 Now gawkies tawpies gowks and fools
 Frae colleges and boarding schools
 May sprout like simmer puddockstools
 In glen or shaw

 May mourn their loss wi doolfu clamour

 Nae mair we see his levee door
 Philosophers and poets pour
 And toothy critics by the score
 In bloody raw

 Now worthy Gregorys Latin face
 Tytlers and Greenfields modest grace
 Mackenzie Stewart such a brace
 As Rome neer saw
 They a maun meet some ither place

 He cheeps like some bewilderd chicken
 Scard frae its minnie and the cleckin

 And Calvins folk are fit to fell him
 Ilk selfconceited critic skellum

 He wha could brawlie ward their bellum

 Up wimpling stately Tweed Ive sped
 And Eden scenes on crystal Jed
 And Ettrick banks now roaring red
 While tempests blaw
 But every joy and pleasures fled
 Willies awa

 May I be Slanders common speech
 A text for Infamy to preach
 And lastly streekit out to bleach
 In winter snaw
 When I forget thee Willie Creech
 Tho far awa

 May never wicked Fortune touzle him
 May never wicked men bamboozle him
 Until a pow as aulds Methusalem
 He canty claw
 Then to the blessed new Jerusalem
 Fleet wing awa

Elegy On Stella

The following poem is the work of some hapless son of the Muses who
deserved a better fate There is a great deal of The voice of Cona in
his solitary mournful notes and had the sentiments been clothed in
Shenstones language they would have been no discredit even to that
elegant poetRB

 Strait is the spot and green the sod
 From whence my sorrows flow
 And soundly sleeps the ever dear
 Inhabitant below

 Pardon my transport gentle shade
 While oer the turf I bow
 Thy earthy house is circumscribd
 And solitary now

 Not one poor stone to tell thy name
 Or make thy virtues known
 But what avails to meto thee
 The sculpture of a stone

 Ill sit me down upon this turf
 And wipe the rising tear
 The chill blast passes swiftly by
 And flits around thy bier

 Dark is the dwelling of the Dead
 And sad their house of rest
 Low lies the head by Deaths cold arms
 In awful fold embracd

 I saw the grim Avenger stand
 Incessant by thy side
 Unseen by thee his deadly breath
 Thy lingering frame destroyd

 Pale grew the roses on thy cheek
 And witherd was thy bloom
 Till the slow poison brought thy youth
 Untimely to the tomb

 Thus wasted are the ranks of men
 Youth Health and Beauty fall
 The ruthless ruin spreads around
 And overwhelms us all

 Behold where round thy narrow house
 The graves unnumberd lie
 The multitude that sleep below
 Existed but to die

 Some with the tottering steps of Age
 Trod down the darksome way
 And some in youths lamented prime
 Like thee were torn away

 Yet these however hard their fate
 Their native earth receives
 Amid their weeping friends they died
 And fill their fathers graves

 From thy lovd friends when first thy heart
 Was taught by Heavn to glow
 Far far removd the ruthless stroke
 Surprisd and laid thee low

 At the last limits of our isle
 Washd by the western wave
 Touchd by thy face a thoughtful bard
 Sits lonely by thy grave

 Pensive he eyes before him spread
 The deep outstretchd and vast
 His mourning notes are borne away
 Along the rapid blast

 And while amid the silent Dead
 Thy hapless fate he mourns
 His own long sorrows freshly bleed
 And all his grief returns

 Like thee cut off in early youth
 And flower of beautys pride
 His friend his first and only joy
 His much lovd Stella died

 Him too the stern impulse of Fate
 Resistless bears along
 And the same rapid tide shall whelm
 The Poet and the Song

 The tear of pity which he sheds
 He asks not to receive
 Let but his poor remains be laid
 Obscurely in the grave

 His griefworn heart with truest joy
 Shall meet he welcome shock
 His airy harp shall lie unstrung
 And silent on the rock

 O my dear maid my Stella when
 Shall this sick period close
 And lead the solitary bard
 To his belovd repose




The Bard At Inverary

 Whoeer he be that sojourns here
 I pity much his case
 Unless he comes to wait upon
 The Lord their God His Grace

 Theres naething here but Highland pride
 And Highland scab and hunger
 If Providence has sent me here
 Twas surely in his anger




Epigram To Miss Jean Scott

 O had each Scot of ancient times
 Been Jeanie Scott as thou art
 The bravest heart on English ground
 Had yielded like a coward




On The Death Of John MLeod Esq

Brother to a young Lady a particular friend of the Authors

 Sad thy tale thou idle page
 And rueful thy alarms
 Death tears the brother of her love
 From Isabellas arms

 Sweetly deckt with pearly dew
 The morning rose may blow
 But cold successive noontide blasts
 May lay its beauties low

 Fair on Isabellas morn
 The sun propitious smild
 But long ere noon succeeding clouds
 Succeeding hopes beguild

 Fate oft tears the bosom chords
 That Nature finest strung
 So Isabellas heart was formd
 And so that heart was wrung

 Dread Omnipotence alone
 Can heal the wound he gave
 Can point the brimful griefworn eyes
 To scenes beyond the grave

 Virtues blossoms there shall blow
 And fear no withering blast
 There Isabellas spotless worth
 Shall happy be at last




Elegy On The Death Of Sir James Hunter Blair

 The lamp of day withill presaging glare
 Dim cloudy sank beneath the western wave
 Th inconstant blast howld thro the darkning air
 And hollow whistled in the rocky cave

 Lone as I wanderd by each cliff and dell
 Once the lovd haunts of Scotias royal train1
 Or musd where limpid streams once hallowd well2
 Or mouldring ruins mark the sacred fane3

 Th increasing blast roard round the beetling rocks
 The clouds swiftwingd flew oer the starry sky
 The groaning trees untimely shed their locks
 And shooting meteors caught the startled eye

 Footnote 1 The Kings Park at Holyrood HouseR B

 Footnote 2 St Anthonys wellR B

 Footnote 3 St Anthonys ChapelR B

 The paly moon rose in the livid east
 And mong the cliffs disclosd a stately form
 In weeds of woe that frantic beat her breast
 And mixd her wailings with the raving storm

 Wild to my heart the filial pulses glow
 Twas Caledonias trophied shield I viewd
 Her form majestic droopd in pensive woe
 The lightning of her eye in tears imbued

 Reversd that spear redoubtable in war
 Reclined that banner erst in fields unfurld
 That like a deathful meteor gleamd afar
 And bravd the mighty monarchs of the world

 My patriot son fills an untimely grave
 With accents wild and lifted arms she cried
 Low lies the hand oft was stretchd to save
 Low lies the heart that swelld with honest pride

 A weeping country joins a widows tear
 The helpless poor mix with the orphans cry
 The drooping arts surround their patrons bier
 And grateful science heaves the heartfelt sigh

 I saw my sons resume their ancient fire
 I saw fair Freedoms blossoms richly blow
 But ah how hope is born but to expire
 Relentless fate has laid their guardian low

 My patriot falls but shall he lie unsung
 While empty greatness saves a worthless name
 No every muse shall join her tuneful tongue
 And future ages hear his growing fame

 And I will join a mothers tender cares
 Thro future times to make his virtues last
 That distant years may boast of other Blairs
 She said and vanishd with the sweeping blast

 Joves tunefu dochters three times three
 Made Homer deep their debtor
 But gien the body half an ee

 Down Georges Street I stoited
 A creeping cauld prosaic fog

 The mournfu sang I here enclose
 In gratitude I send you
 And pray in rhyme as weel as prose
 A gude things may attend you




Written By Somebody On The Window

Of an Inn at Stirling on seeing the Royal Palace in ruin

 Here Stuarts once in glory reigned
 And laws for Scotlands weal ordained
 But now unroofd their palace stands
 Their sceptres swayd by other hands
 Fallen indeed and to the earth
 Whence groveling reptiles take their birth
 The injured Stuart line is gone
 A race outlandish fills their throne
 An idiot race to honour lost
 Who know them best despise them most




The Poets Reply To The Threat Of A Censorious Critic

My imprudent lines were answered very petulantly by somebody I

The Libellers SelfReproof1

 Rash mortal and slanderous poet thy name
 Shall no longer appear in the records of Fame

Verses Written With A Pencil

Over the Chimneypiece in the Parlour of the Inn at Kenmore Taymouth


 Admiring Nature in her wildest grace
 These northern scenes with weary feet I trace
 Oer many a winding dale and painful steep
 Th abodes of coveyd grouse and timid sheep

 Footnote 1 These are rhymes of dubious authenticityLang

 My savage journey curious I pursue
 Till famd Breadalbane opens to my view
 The meeting cliffs each deepsunk glen divides
 The woods wild scatterd clothe their ample sides
 Th outstretching lake imbosomed mong the hills
 The eye with wonder and amazement fills
 The Tay meandring sweet in infant pride
 The palace rising on his verdant side
 The lawns woodfringd in Natures native taste
 The hillocks dropt in Natures careless haste
 The arches striding oer the newborn stream
 The village glittering in the noontide beam

 Poetic ardours in my bosom swell
 Lone wandring by the hermits mossy cell
 The sweeping theatre of hanging woods
 Th incessant roar of headlong tumbling floods

 Here Poesy might wake her heavntaught lyre
 And look through Nature with creative fire
 Here to the wrongs of Fate half reconcild
 Misfortunes lightend steps might wander wild
 And Disappointment in these lonely bounds
 Find balm to soothe her bitter rankling wounds
 Here heartstruck Grief might heavnward stretch her scan
 And injurd Worth forget and pardon man

 TuneThe Birks of Abergeldie


 ChorusBonie lassie will ye go
 Will ye go will ye go
 Bonie lassie will ye go
 To the birks of Aberfeldy

 Now Simmer blinks on flowery braes
 And oer the crystal streamlets plays
 Come let us spend the lightsome days
 In the birks of Aberfeldy
 Bonie lassie c

 While oer their heads the hazels hing
 The little birdies blythely sing
 Or lightly flit on wanton wing
 In the birks of Aberfeldy

 The braes ascend like lofty was
 The foaming stream deeproaring fas
 Oerhung wi fragrant spreading shaws
 The birks of Aberfeldy

 The hoary cliffs are crownd wi flowers
 White oer the linns the burnie pours
 And rising weets wi misty showers
 The birks of Aberfeldy
 Bonie lassie c

 Let Fortunes gifts at randoe flee
 They neer shall draw a wish frae me
 Supremely blest wi love and thee
 In the birks of Aberfeldy

The Humble Petition Of Bruar Water

 To the noble Duke of Athole

 My lord I know your noble ear
 Woe neer assails in vain
 Emboldend thus I beg youll hear
 Your humble slave complain
 How saucy Phoebus scorching beams
 In flaming summerpride
 Drywithering waste my foamy streams
 And drink my crystal tide1

 The lightlyjumping glowrin trouts
 That thro my waters play
 If in their random wanton spouts
 They near the margin stray

 Footnote 1 Bruar Falls in Athole are exceedingly picturesque
 and beautiful but their effect is much impaired by the want of
 trees and shrubsRB

 If hapless chance they linger lang
 Im scorching up so shallow
 Theyre left the whitening stanes amang
 In gasping death to wallow

 Last day I grat wi spite and teen
 As poet Burns came by
 That to a bard I should be seen
 Wi half my channel dry
 A panegyric rhyme I ween
 Evn as I was he shord me
 But had I in my glory been
 He kneeling wad adord me

 Here foaming down the skelvy rocks
 In twisting strength I rin
 There high my boiling torrent smokes
 Wildroaring oer a linn
 Enjoying each large spring and well
 As Nature gave them me
 I am altho I sayt mysel
 Worth gaun a mile to see

 Would then my noble master please
 To grant my highest wishes
 Hell shade my banks wi towring trees
 And bonie spreading bushes
 Delighted doubly then my lord
 Youll wander on my banks
 And listen mony a grateful bird
 Return you tuneful thanks

 The sober lavrock warbling wild
 Shall to the skies aspire
 The gowdspink Musics gayest child
 Shall sweetly join the choir
 The blackbird strong the lintwhite clear
 The mavis mild and mellow
 The robin pensive Autumn cheer
 In all her locks of yellow

 This too a covert shall ensure
 To shield them from the storm
 And coward maukin sleep secure
 Low in her grassy form
 Here shall the shepherd make his seat
 To weave his crown of flowrs
 Or find a sheltring safe retreat
 From pronedescending showrs

 And here by sweet endearing stealth
 Shall meet the loving pair
 Despising worlds with all their wealth
 As empty idle care
 The flowrs shall vie in all their charms
 The hour of heavn to grace
 And birks extend their fragrant arms
 To screen the dear embrace

 Here haply too at vernal dawn
 Some musing bard may stray
 And eye the smoking dewy lawn
 And misty mountain grey
 Or by the reapers nightly beam
 Mildchequering thro the trees
 Rave to my darkly dashing stream
 Hoarseswelling on the breeze

 Let lofty firs and ashes cool
 My lowly banks oerspread
 And view deepbending in the pool
 Their shadows watry bed
 Let fragrant birks in woodbines drest
 My craggy cliffs adorn
 And for the little songsters nest
 The close embowring thorn

 So may old Scotias darling hope
 Your little angel band
 Spring like their fathers up to prop
 Their honourd native land
 So may thro Albions farthest ken
 To socialflowing glasses
 The grace beAtholes honest men
 And Atholes bonie lasses




Lines On The Fall Of Fyers Near LochNess

 Written with a Pencil on the Spot


 Among the heathy hills and ragged woods
 The roaring Fyers pours his mossy floods
 Till full he dashes on the rocky mounds
 Where thro a shapeless breach his stream resounds
 As high in air the bursting torrents flow
 As deep recoiling surges foam below
 Prone down the rock the whitening sheet descends
 And viewles Echos ear astonished rends
 Dimseen through rising mists and ceaseless showrs
 The hoary cavern wide surrounding lours
 Still thro the gap the struggling river toils
 And still below the horrid cauldron boils




Epigram On Parting With A Kind Host In The Highlands

 When Deaths dark stream I ferry oer
 A time that surely shall come
 In Heavn itself Ill ask no more
 Than just a Highland welcome




Strathallans Lament1

 Thickest night oerhang my dwelling
 Howling tempests oer me rave
 Turbid torrents wintry swelling
 Roaring by my lonely cave

 Footnote 1 Burns confesses that his Jacobtism was merely
 sentimental except when my passions were heated by some
 accidental cause and a tour through the country where Montrose
 Claverhouse and Prince Charles had fought was cause enough
 Strathallan fell gloriously at CullodenLang

 Crystal streamlets gently flowing
 Busy haunts of base mankind
 Western breezes softly blowing
 Suit not my distracted mind

 In the cause of Right engaged
 Wrongs injurious to redress
 Honours war we strongly waged
 But the Heavens denied success
 Ruins wheel has driven oer us
 Not a hope that dare attend
 The wide world is all before us
 But a world without a friend




Castle Gordon

 Streams that glide in orient plains
 Never bound by Winters chains
 Glowing here on golden sands
 There immixd with foulest stains
 From Tyrannys empurpled hands
 These their richly gleaming waves
 I leave to tyrants and their slaves
 Give me the stream that sweetly laves
 The banks by Castle Gordon

 Spicy forests ever gray
 Shading from the burning ray
 Hapless wretches sold to toil
 Or the ruthless natives way
 Bent on slaughter blood and spoil
 Woods that ever verdant wave
 I leave the tyrant and the slave
 Give me the groves that lofty brave
 The storms by Castle Gordon

 Wildly here without control
 Nature reigns and rules the whole
 In that sober pensive mood
 Dearest to the feeling soul
 She plants the forest pours the flood
 Lifes poor day Ill musing rave
 And find at night a sheltering cave
 Where waters flow and wild woods wave

The Bonie Lass Of Albany1

 TuneMarys Dream


 My heart is wae and unco wae
 To think upon the raging sea
 That roars between her gardens green
 An the bonie Lass of Albany

 This lovely maids of royal blood
 That ruled Albions kingdoms three
 But oh alas for her bonie face
 Theyve wrangd the Lass of Albany

 In the rolling tide of spreading Clyde
 There sits an isle of high degree
 And a town of fame whose princely name
 Should grace the Lass of Albany

 But theres a youth a witless youth
 That fills the place where she should be
 Well send him oer to his native shore
 And bring our ain sweet Albany

 Alas the day and woe the day
 A false usurper wan the gree
 Who now commands the towers and lands
 The royal right of Albany

 Well daily pray well nightly pray
 On bended knees most fervently
 The time may come with pipe an drum
 Well welcome hame fair Albany

On Scaring Some WaterFowl In LochTurit

 A wild scene among the Hills of Oughtertyre

This was the production of a solitary forenoons walk from Oughtertyre
House I lived there the guest of Sir William Murray for two or three
weeks and was much flattered by my hospitable reception What a pity that
the mere emotions of gratitude are so impotent in this world Tis lucky
that as we are told they will be of some avail in the world to come
RB Glenriddell MSS


 Why ye tenants of the lake
 For me your watry haunt forsake
 Tell me fellowcreatures why
 At my presence thus you fly
 Why disturb your social joys
 Parent filial kindred ties
 Common friend to you and me
 yatures gifts to all are free
 Peaceful keep your dimpling wave
 Busy feed or wanton lave
 Or beneath the sheltering rock
 Bide the surging billows shock

 Conscious blushing for our race
 Soon too soon your fears I trace
 Man your proud usurping foe
 Would be lord of all below
 Plumes himself in freedoms pride
 Tyrant stern to all beside

 The eagle from the cliffy brow
 Marking you his prey below
 In his breast no pity dwells
 Strong necessity compels
 But Man to whom alone is givn
 A ray direct from pitying Heavn
 Glories in his heart humane
 And creatures for his pleasure slain

 In these savage liquid plains
 Only known to wandring swains
 Where the mossy rivlet strays
 Far from human haunts and ways
 All on Nature you depend
 And lifes poor season peaceful spend

 Or if mans superior might
 Dare invade your native right
 On the lofty ether borne
 Man with all his powrs you scorn
 Swiftly seek on clanging wings
 Other lakes and other springs
 And the foe you cannot brave
 Scorn at least to be his slave




Blythe Was She1

 TuneAndro and his Cutty Gun


 ChorusBlythe blythe and merry was she
 Blythe was she but and ben
 Blythe by the banks of Earn
 And blythe in Glenturit glen

 By Oughtertyre grows the aik
 On Yarrow banks the birken shaw
 But Phemie was a bonier lass
 Than braes o Yarrow ever saw
 Blythe blythe c

 Her looks were like a flowr in May
 Her smile was like a simmer morn
 She tripped by the banks o Earn
 As lights a bird upon a thorn
 Blythe blythe c

 Her bonie face it was as meek
 As ony lamb upon a lea
 The evening sun was neer sae sweet
 As was the blink o Phemies ee
 Blythe blythe c

 And oer the Lawlands I hae been

A RoseBud By My Early Walk

 A Rosebud by my early walk
 Adown a cornenclosed bawk
 Sae gently bent its thorny stalk
 All on a dewy morning
 Ere twice the shades o dawn are fled
 In a its crimson glory spread
 And drooping rich the dewy head
 It scents the early morning

 Within the bush her covert nest
 A little linnet fondly prest
 The dew sat chilly on her breast
 Sae early in the morning
 She soon shall see her tender brood
 The pride the pleasure o the wood
 Amang the fresh green leaves bedewd
 Awake the early morning

 So thou dear bird young Jeany fair
 On trembling string or vocal air
 Shall sweetly pay the tender care
 That tents thy early morning
 So thou sweet Rosebud young and gay
 Shalt beauteous blaze upon the day
 And bless the parents evening ray
 That watchd thy early morning

SongThe Banks Of The Devon

 TuneBhanarach dhonn a chruidh


 How pleasant the banks of the clear winding Devon
 With green spreading bushes and flowrs blooming fair
 But the boniest flowr on the banks of the Devon
 Was once a sweet bud on the braes of the Ayr
 Mild be the sun on this sweet blushing flower
 In the gay rosy morn as it bathes in the dew
 And gentle the fall of the soft vernal shower
 That steals on the evening each leaf to renew

 O spare the dear blossom ye orient breezes
 With chill hoary wing as ye usher the dawn
 And far be thou distant thou reptile that seizes
 The verdure and pride of the garden or lawn
 Let Bourbon exult in his gay gilded lilies
 And England triumphant display her proud rose
 A fairer than either adorns the green valleys
 Where Devon sweet Devon meandering flows




Braving Angry Winters Storms

 TuneNeil Gows Lament for Abercairny


 Where braving angry winters storms
 The lofty Ochils rise
 Far in their shade my Peggys charms
 First blest my wondering eyes
 As one who by some savage stream
 A lonely gem surveys
 Astonishd doubly marks it beam
 With arts most polishd blaze

 Footnote 1 Of the Edinburgh High School

 Blest be the wild sequesterd shade
 And blest the day and hour
 Where Peggys charms I first surveyd
 When first I felt their powr
 The tyrant Death with grim control
 May seize my fleeting breath
 But tearing Peggy from my soul
 Must be a stronger death




SongMy Peggys Charms

 TuneTha a chailleach ir mo dheigh


 My Peggys face my Peggys form
 The frost of hermit Age might warm
 My Peggys worth my Peggys mind
 Might charm the first of human kind

 I love my Peggys angel air
 Her face so truly heavenly fair
 Her native grace so void of art
 But I adore my Peggys heart

 The lilys hue the roses dye
 The kindling lustre of an eye
 Who but owns their magic sway
 Who but knows they all decay

 The tender thrill the pitying tear
 The generous purpose nobly dear
 The gentle look that rage disarms
 These are all Immortal charms

 The snaws the mountains cover
 Like winter on me seizes
 Since my young Highland rover
 Far wanders nations over

 The trees now naked groaning
 Shall soon wi leaves be hinging
 The birdies dowie moaning
 Shall a be blythely singing
 And every flower be springing
 Sae Ill rejoice the leelang day
 When by his mighty Warden
 My youths returnd to fair Strathspey

Birthday Ode For 31st December 17871

 Afar the illustrious Exile roams
 Whom kingdoms on this day should hail
 An inmate in the casual shed
 On transient pitys bounty fed
 Haunted by busy memorys bitter tale
 Beasts of the forest have their savage homes
 But He who should imperial purple wear
 Owns not the lap of earth where rests his royal head
 His wretched refuge dark despair
 While ravening wrongs and woes pursue
 And distant far the faithful few
 Who would his sorrows share

 False flatterer Hope away
 Nor think to lure us as in days of yore
 We solemnize this sorrowing natal day
 To prove our loyal truthwe can no more
 And owning Heavens mysterious sway
 Submissive low adore

 Ye honored mighty Dead
 Who nobly perished in the glorious cause
 Your King your Country and her laws

 Footnote 1 The last birthday of Prince Charles Edward

 From great Dundee who smiling Victory led
 And fell a Martyr in her arms
 What breast of northern ice but warms
 To bold Balmerinos undying name
 Whose soul of fire lighted at Heavens high flame
 Deserves the proudest wreath departed heroes claim
 Nor unrevenged your fate shall lie
 It only lags the fatal hour
 Your blood shall with incessant cry
 Awake at last th unsparing Power
 As from the cliff with thundering course
 The snowy ruin smokes along
 With doubling speed and gathering force
 Till deep it crushing whelms the cottage in the vale
 So Vengeance arm ensanguind strong
 Shall with resistless might assail
 Usurping Brunswicks pride shall lay
 And Stewarts wrongs and yours with tenfold weight repay

 Perdition baleful child of night
 Rise and revenge the injured right
 Of Stewarts royal race
 Lead on the unmuzzled hounds of hell
 Till all the frighted echoes tell
 The bloodnotes of the chase
 Full on the quarry point their view
 Full on the base usurping crew
 The tools of faction and the nations curse
 Hark how the cry grows on the wind
 They leave the lagging gale behind
 Their savage fury pitiless they pour
 With murdering eyes already they devour
 See Brunswick spent a wretched prey
 His life one poor despairing day
 Where each avenging hour still ushers in a worse
 Such havock howling all abroad
 Their utter ruin bring
 The base apostates to their God
 Or rebels to their King




On The Death Of Robert Dundas Esq Of Arniston

 Late Lord President of the Court of Session


 Lone on the bleaky hills the straying flocks
 Shun the fierce storms among the sheltering rocks
 Down from the rivulets red with dashing rains
 The gathering floods burst oer the distant plains
 Beneath the blast the leafless forests groan
 The hollow caves return a hollow moan
 Ye hills ye plains ye forests and ye caves
 Ye howling winds and wintry swelling waves
 Unheard unseen by human ear or eye
 Sad to your sympathetic glooms I fly
 Where to the whistling blast and waters roar
 Pale Scotias recent wound I may deplore

 O heavy loss thy country ill could bear
 A loss these evil days can neer repair
 Justice the high vicegerent of her God
 Her doubtful balance eyed and swayd her rod
 Hearing the tidings of the fatal blow
 She sank abandond to the wildest woe

 Wrongs injuries from many a darksome den
 Now gay in hope explore the paths of men
 See from his cavern grim Oppression rise
 And throw on Poverty his cruel eyes
 Keen on the helpless victim see him fly
 And stifle dark the feeblybursting cry
 Mark Ruffian Violence distained with crimes
 Rousing elate in these degenerate times
 View unsuspecting Innocence a prey
 As guileful Fraud points out the erring way
 While subtle Litigations pliant tongue
 The lifeblood equal sucks of Right and Wrong
 Hark injurd Want recounts th unlistend tale
 And muchwrongd Misry pours the unpitied wail

 Ye dark waste hills ye brown unsightly plains
 Congenial scenes ye soothe my mournful strains
 Ye tempests rage ye turbid torrents roll
 Ye suit the joyless tenor of my soul
 Lifes social haunts and pleasures I resign
 Be nameless wilds and lonely wanderings mine
 To mourn the woes my country must endure
 That would degenerate ages cannot cure




Sylvander To Clarinda1

Extempore Reply to Verses addressed to the Author by a Lady under the
signature of Clarinda and entitled On Burns saying he had nothing else
to do

 When dear Clarinda matchless fair
 First struck Sylvanders rapturd view
 He gazd he listened to despair
 Alas twas all he dared to do

 Love from Clarindas heavenly eyes
 Transfixed his bosom thro and thro
 But still in Friendships guarded guise
 For more the demon feard to do

 That heart already more than lost
 The imp beleaguerd all perdue
 For frowning Honour kept his post
 To meet that frown he shrunk to do

 His pangs the Bard refused to own
 Tho half he wishd Clarinda knew
 But Anguish wrung the unweeting groan
 Who blames what frantic Pain must do

 That heart where motley follies blend
 Was sternly still to Honour true
 To prove Clarindas fondest friend
 Was what a lover sure might do

 Footnote 1 A grasswidow Mrs MLehose

 The Muse his ready quill employed
 No nearer bliss he could pursue
 That bliss Clarinda cold denyd
 Send word by Charles how you do

 The chill behest disarmd his muse
 Till passion all impatient grew
 He wrote and hinted for excuse
 Twas cause hed nothing else to do

 But by those hopes I have above
 And by those faults I dearly rue
 The deed the boldest mark of love
 For thee that deed I dare uo do

 O could the Fates but name the price
 Would bless me with your charms and you
 With frantic joy Id pay it thrice
 If human art and power could do

 Then take Clarinda friendships hand
 Friendship at least I may avow
 And lay no more your chill command
 Ill write whatever Ive to do

Love In The Guise Of Friendship

 Your friendship much can make me blest
 O why that bliss destroy
 Why urge the only one request
 You know I will deny

 Your thought if Love must harbour there
 Conceal it in that thought
 Nor cause me from my bosom tear
 The very friend I sought




Go On Sweet Bird And Sooth My Care

 For thee is laughing Nature gay
 For thee she pours the vernal day
 For me in vain is Nature drest
 While Joys a stranger to my breast




Clarinda Mistress Of My Soul

 Clarinda mistres of my soul
 The measurd time is run
 The wretch beneath the dreary pole
 So marks his latest sun

 To what dark cave of frozen night
 Shall poor Sylvander hie
 Deprivd of thee his life and light
 The sun of all his joy

 We partbut by these precious drops
 That fill thy lovely eyes
 No other light shall guide my steps
 Till thy bright beams arise

 She the fair sun of all her sex
 Has blest my glorious day
 And shall a glimmering planet fix
 My worship to its ray

 To the weavers c

 I sat beside my warpinwheel
 And aye I cad it roun
 But every shot and evey knock
 My heart it gae a stoun
 To the weavers c

 The moon was sinking in the west
 Wi visage pale and wan
 As my bonie westlin weaver lad
 Convoyd me thro the glen
 To the weavers c

 But what was said or what was done
 Shame fa me gin I tell
 But Oh I fear the kintra soon
 Will ken as weels myself

MPhersons Farewell

 TuneMPhersons Rant


 Farewell ye dungeons dark and strong
 The wretchs destinie
 MPhersons time will not be long
 On yonder gallowstree

 ChorusSae rantingly sae wantonly
 Sae dauntingly gaed he
 He playd a spring and dancd it round
 Below the gallowstree

 O what is death but parting breath
 On many a bloody plain
 Ive dared his face and in this place
 I scorn him yet again
 Sae rantingly c

 Untie these bands from off my hands
 And bring me to my sword
 And theres no a man in all Scotland
 But Ill brave him at a word
 Sae rantingly c

 Ive livd a life of sturt and strife
 I die by treacherie
 It burns my heart I must depart
 And not avenged be
 Sae rantingly c

 Now farewell light thou sunshine bright
 And all beneath the sky
 May coward shame distain his name
 The wretch that dares not die
 Sae rantingly c




Stay My Charmer

 TuneAn gille dubh ciardhubh


 Stay my charmer can you leave me
 Cruel cruel to deceive me
 Well you know how much you grieve me
 Cruel charmer can you go
 Cruel charmer can you go

 By my love so illrequited
 By the faith you fondly plighted
 By the pangs of lovers slighted
 Do not do not liave me so
 Do not do not leave me so

 The tod replyd upon the hill
 I trembled for my Hoggie
 When day did daw and cocks did craw
 The morning it was foggie
 An unco tyke lap oer the dyke
 And maist has killd my Hoggie




Raving Winds Around Her Blowing

 TuneMGrigor of Roros Lament

I composed these verses on Miss Isabella MLeod of Raza alluding to her
feelings on the death of her sister and the still more melancholy death
of her sisters husband the late Earl of Loudoun who shot himself out
of sheer heartbreak at some mortifications he suffered owing to the
deranged state of his financesRB 1971


 Raving winds around her blowing
 Yellow leaves the woodlands strowing
 By a river hoarsely roaring
 Isabella strayd deploring

 Farewell hours that late did measure
 Sunshine days of joy and pleasure
 Hail thou gloomy night of sorrow
 Cheerless night that knows no morrow

 Oer the past too fondly wandering
 On the hopeless future pondering
 Chilly grief my lifeblood freezes
 Fell despair my fancy seizes

 Life thou soul of every blessing
 Load to misery most distressing
 Gladly how would I resign thee
 And to dark oblivion join thee




Up In The Morning Early

 Cauld blaws the wind frae east to west
 The drift is driving sairly
 Sae loud and shills I hear the blast
 Im sure its winter fairly

 ChorusUp in the mornings no for me
 Up in the morning early
 When a the hills are covered wi snaw
 Im sure its winter fairly

 The birds sit chittering in the thorn
 A day they fare but sparely
 And langs the night frae een to morn
 Im sure its winter fairly
 Up in the mornings c

 How Long And Dreary Is The Night

 How long and dreary is the night
 When I am frae my dearie
 I sleepless lie frae een to morn
 Tho I were neer so weary
 I sleepless lie frae een to morn
 Tho I were neer sae weary

 When I think on the happy days
 I spent wi you my dearie
 And now what lands between us lie
 How can I be but eerie
 And now what lands between us lie
 How can I be but eerie

 How slow ye move ye heavy hours
 As ye were wae and weary
 It wasna sae ye glinted by
 When I was wi my dearie
 It wasna sae ye glinted by
 When I was wi my dearie




Hey The Dusty Miller

 Hey the dusty Miller
 And his dusty coat
 He will win a shilling
 Or he spend a groat
 Dusty was the coat
 Dusty was the colour
 Dusty was the kiss
 That I gat frae the Miller

 Hey the dusty Miller
 And his dusty sack
 Leeze me on the calling
 Fills the dusty peck
 Fills the dusty peck
 Brings the dusty siller
 I wad gie my coatie
 For the dusty Miller




Duncan Davison

 There was a lass they cad her Meg
 And she held oer the moors to spin
 There was a lad that followd her
 They cad him Duncan Davison
 The moor was dreigh and Meg was skeigh
 Her favour Duncan could na win
 For wi the rock she wad him knock
 And aye she shook the temperpin

 As oer the moor they lightly foor
 A burn was clear a glen was green
 Upon the banks they easd their shanks
 And aye she set the wheel between
 But Duncan swoor a haly aith
 That Meg should be a bride the morn
 Then Meg took up her spinninggraith
 And flang them a out oer the burn

 We will big a wee wee house
 And we will live like king and queen
 Sae blythe and merrys we will be
 When ye set by the wheel at een
 A man may drink and no be drunk
 A man may fight and no be slain
 A man may kiss a bonie lass
 And aye be welcome back again

 Wearying heavn in warm devotion

 Hope and Fears alternate billow
 Yielding late to Natures law
 Whispering spirits round my pillow

 Downy sleep the curtain draw
 Spirits kind again attend me

 The bludered rose at Yule may blaw
 The simmer lilies bloom in snaw
 The frost may freeze the deepest sea
 But an auld man shall never daunton me

The Winter It Is Past

 The winter it is past and the summer comes at last
 And the small birds they sing on evry tree
 Now evry thing is glad while I am very sad
 Since my true love is parted from me

 The rose upon the breer by the waters running clear
 May have charms for the linnet or the bee
 Their little loves are blest and their little hearts at rest
 But my true love is parted from me




The Bonie Lad Thats Far Awa

 O how can I be blythe and glad
 Or how can I gang brisk and braw
 When the bonie lad that I loe best
 Is oer the hills and far awa

 Its no the frosty winter wind
 Its no the driving drift and snaw
 But aye the tear comes in my ee
 To think on him thats far awa

 My father pat me frae his door
 My friends they hae disownd me a
 But I hae ane will tak my part
 The bonie lad thats far awa

 A pair o glooves he bought to me
 And silken snoods he gae me twa
 And I will wear them for his sake
 The bonie lad thats far awa

 O weary Winter soon will pass
 And Spring will cleed the birken shaw
 And my young babie will be born
 And hell be hame thats far awa




Verses To Clarinda

 Sent with a Pair of WineGlasses


 Fair Empress of the Poets soul
 And Queen of Poetesses
 Clarinda take this little boon
 This humble pair of glasses

 And fill them up with generous juice
 As generous as your mind
 And pledge them to the generous toast
 The whole of human kind

 To those who love us second fill
 But not to those whom we love
 Lest we love those who love not us
 A thirdTo thee and me Love




The Chevaliers Lament

 AirCaptain OKean

 The small birds rejoice in the green leaves returning
 The murmuring streamlet winds clear thro the vale
 The primroses blow in the dews of the morning
 And wild scatterd cowslips bedeck the green dale
 But what can give pleasure or what can seem fair
 When the lingering moments are numbered by care
 No birds sweetly singing nor flowrs gaily springing
 Can soothe the sad bosom of joyless despair

 The deed that I dared could it merit their malice
 A king and a father to place on his throne
 His right are these hills and his right are these valleys
 Where the wild beasts find shelter tho I can find none
 But tis not my suffrings thus wretched forlorn
 My brave gallant friends tis your ruin I mourn
 Your faith proved so loyal in hot bloody trial
 Alas I can make it no better return




Epistle To Hugh Parker

 In this strange land this uncouth clime
 A land unknown to prose or rhyme
 Where words neer crosst the Muses heckles
 Nor limpit in poetic shackles
 A land that Prose did never view it
 Except when drunk he stachert thro it
 Here ambushd by the chimla cheek
 Hid in an atmosphere of reek
 I hear a wheel thrum i the neuk
 I hear itfor in vain I leuk
 The red peat gleams a fiery kernel
 Enhusked by a fog infernal
 Here for my wonted rhyming raptures
 I sit and count my sins by chapters
 For life and spunk like ither Christians
 Im dwindled down to mere existence
 Wi nae converse but Gallowa bodies
 Wi nae kennd face but Jenny Geddes
 Jenny my Pegasean pride
 Dowie she saunters down Nithside
 And aye a westlin leuk she throws
 While tears hap oer her auld brown nose
 Was it for this wi cannie care
 Thou bure the Bard through many a shire
 At howes or hillocks never stumbled
 And late or early never grumbled
 O had I power like inclination
 Id heeze thee up a constellation
 To canter with the Sagitarre
 Or loup the ecliptic like a bar
 Or turn the pole like any arrow
 Or when auld Phoebus bids goodmorrow
 Down the zodiac urge the race
 And cast dirt on his godships face
 For I could lay my bread and kail
 Hed neer cast saut upo thy tail
 Wi a this care and a this grief
 And sma sma prospect of relief
 And nought but peat reek i my head
 How can I write what ye can read
 Tarbolton twentyfourth o June
 Yell find me in a better tune
 But till we meet and weet our whistle
 Tak this excuse for nae epistle

 Glenriddel Hermitage June 28th 1788

 Thou whom chance may hither lead
 Be thou clad in russet weed
 Be thou deckt in silken stole
 Grave these maxims on thy soul

 Life is but a day at most
 Sprung from night in darkness lost
 Hope not sunshine every hour
 Fear not clouds will always lour

 Happiness is but a name
 Make content and ease thy aim
 Ambition is a meteorgleam
 Fame an idle restless dream

 Peace the tendrest flowr of spring
 Pleasures insects on the wing
 Those that sip the dew alone
 Make the butterflies thy own
 Those that would the bloom devour
 Crush the locusts save the flower

 For the future be prepard
 Guard wherever thou canst guard
 But thy utmost duly done
 Welcome what thou canst not shun
 Follies past give thou to air
 Make their consequence thy care
 Keep the name of Man in mind
 And dishonour not thy kind
 Reverence with lowly heart
 Him whose wondrous work thou art
 Keep His Goodness still in view
 Thy trust and thy example too

 Stranger go Heaven be thy guide

To Alex Cunningham ESQ Writer

 Ellisland Nithsdale July 27th 1788

 My godlike friendnay do not stare
 You think the phrase is oddlike
 But God is love the saints declare
 Then surely thou art godlike

 And is thy ardour still the same
 And kindled still at Anna
 Others may boast a partial flame
 But thou art a volcano

 Evn Wedlock asks not love beyond
 Deaths tiedissolving portal
 But thou omnipotently fond
 Mayst promise love immortal

 Thy wounds such healing powers defy
 Such symptoms dire attend them
 That last great antihectic try
 Marriage perhaps may mend them

 Sweet Anna has an aira grace
 Divine magnetic touching
 She talks she charmsbut who can trace
 The process of bewitching




SongAnna Thy Charms

 Anna thy charms my bosom fire
 And waste my soul with care
 But ah how bootless to admire
 When fated to despair

 Yet in thy presence lovely Fair
 To hope may be forgiven
 For sure twere impious to despair
 So much in sight of heaven

Epistle To Robert Graham Esq Of Fintry

 Requesting a Favour

 When Nature her great masterpiece designd
 And framd her last best work the human mind
 Her eye intent on all the mazy plan
 She formd of various parts the various Man

 Then first she calls the useful many forth
 Plain plodding Industry and sober Worth
 Thence peasants farmers native sons of earth
 And merchandise whole genus take their birth
 Each prudent cit a warm existence finds
 And all mechanics manyaprond kinds
 Some other rarer sorts are wanted yet
 The lead and buoy are needful to the net
 The caput mortuum of grnss desires
 Makes a material for mere knights and squires
 The martial phosphorus is taught to flow
 She kneads the lumpish philosophic dough
 Then marks th unyielding mass with grave designs
 Law physic politics and deep divines
 Last she sublimes th Aurora of the poles
 The flashing elements of female souls

 The orderd system fair before her stood
 Nature well pleasd pronouncd it very good
 But ere she gave creating labour oer
 Halfjest she tried one curious labour more
 Some spumy fiery ignis fatuus matter
 Such as the slightest breath of air might scatter
 With archalacrity and conscious glee
 Nature may have her whim as well as we
 Her Hogarthart perhaps she meant to show it
 She forms the thing and christens ita Poet
 Creature tho oft the prey of care and sorrow
 When blest today unmindful of tomorrow
 A being formd t amuse his graver friends
 Admird and praisdand there the homage ends
 A mortal quite unfit for Fortunes strife
 Yet oft the sport of all the ills of life
 Prone to enjoy each pleasure riches give
 Yet haply wanting wherewithal to live
 Longing to wipe each tear to heal each groan
 Yet frequent all unheeded in his own

 But honest Nature is not quite a Turk
 She laughd at first then felt for her poor work
 Pitying the propless climber of mankind
 She cast about a standard tree to find
 And to support his helpless woodbine state
 Attachd him to the generous truly great
 A title and the only one I claim
 To lay strong hold for help on bounteous Graham

 Pity the tuneful Muses hapless train
 Weak timid landsmen on lifes stormy main
 Their hearts no selfish stern absorbent stuff
 That never givestho humbly takes enough
 The little fate allows they share as soon
 Unlike sage proverbd Wisdoms hardwrung boon
 The world were blest did bliss on them depend
 Ah that the friendly eer should want a friend
 Let Prudence number oer each sturdy son
 Who life and wisdom at one race begun
 Who feel by reason and who give by rule
 Instincts a brute and sentiment a fool
 Who make poor will do wait upon I should
 We own theyre prudent but who feels theyre good
 Ye wise ones hence ye hurt the social eye
 Gods image rudely etchd on base alloy
 But come ye who the godlike pleasure know
 Heavens attribute distinguishedto bestow
 Whose arms of love would grasp the human race
 Come thou who givst with all a courtiers grace
 Friend of my life true patron of my rhymes
 Prop of my dearest hopes for future times
 Why shrinks my soul half blushing half afraid
 Backward abashd to ask thy friendly aid
 I know my need I know thy giving hand
 I crave thy friendship at thy kind command
 But there are such who court the tuneful Nine
 Heavens should the branded character be mine
 Whose verse in manhoods pride sublimely flows
 Yet vilest reptiles in their begging prose
 Mark how their lofty independent spirit
 Soars on the spurning wing of injured merit
 Seek not the proofs in private life to find
 Pity the best of words should be but wind
 So to heavens gates the larks shrill song ascends
 But grovelling on the earth the carol ends
 In all the clamrous cry of starving want
 They dun Benevolence with shameless front
 Oblige them patronise their tinsel lays
 They persecute you all your future days
 Ere my poor soul such deep damnation stain
 My horny fist assume the plough again
 The piebald jacket let me patch once more
 On eighteenpence a week Ive livd before
 Tho thanks to Heaven I dare even that last shift
 I trust meantime my boon is in thy gift
 That placd by thee upon the wishdfor height
 Where man and nature fairer in her sight
 My Muse may imp her wing for some sublimer flight




SongThe Day Returns

 TuneSeventh of November


 The day returns my bosom burns
 The blissful day we twa did meet
 Tho winter wild in tempest toild
 Neer summersun was half sae sweet
 Than a the pride that loads the tide
 And crosses oer the sultry line
 Than kingly robes than crowns and globes
 Heavn gave me moreit made thee mine

 While day and night can bring delight
 Or Nature aught of pleasure give
 While joys above my mind can move
 For thee and thee alone I live
 When that grim foe of life below
 Comes in between to make us part
 The iron hand that breaks our band
 It breaks my blissit breaks my heart




SongO Were I On Parnassus Hill

 TuneMy love is lost to me


 O were I on Parnassus hill
 Or had o Helicon my fill
 That I might catch poetic skill
 To sing how dear I love thee
 But Nith maun be my Muses well
 My Muse maun be thy bonie sel
 On Corsincon Ill glowr and spell
 And write how dear I love thee

 Then come sweet Muse inspire my lay
 For a the leelang simmers day
 I couldna sing I couldna say
 How much how dear I love thee
 I see thee dancing oer the green
 Thy waist sae jimp thy limbs sae clean
 Thy tempting lips thy roguish een
 By Heaven and Earth I love thee

 By night by day afield at hame
 The thoughts o thee my breast inflame
 And aye I muse and sing thy name
 I only live to love thee
 Tho I were doomd to wander on
 Beyond the sea beyond the sun
 Till my last weary sand was run
 Till thenand then I love thee




A Mothers Lament

 For the Death of Her Son

 Fate gave the word the arrow sped
 And piercd my darlings heart
 And with him all the joys are fled
 Life can to me impart

 By cruel hands the sapling drops
 In dust dishonourd laid
 So fell the pride of all my hopes
 My ages future shade

 The motherlinnet in the brake
 Bewails her ravishd young
 So I for my lost darlings sake
 Lament the liveday long

 Death oft Ive feared thy fatal blow
 Now fond I bare my breast
 O do thou kindly lay me low
 With him I love at rest




The Fall Of The Leaf

 The lazy mist hangs from the brow of the hill
 Concealing the course of the darkwinding rill
 How languid the scenes late so sprightly appear
 As Autumn to Winter resigns the pale year

 The forests are leafless the meadows are brown
 And all the gay foppery of summer is flown
 Apart let me wander apart let me muse
 How quick Time is flying how keen Fate pursues

 How long I have livdbut how much livd in vain
 How little of lifes scanty span may remain
 What aspects old Time in his progress has worn
 What ties cruel Fate in my bosom has torn

 How foolish or worse till our summit is gaind
 And downward how weakend how darkend how paind
 Life is not worth having with all it can give
 For something beyond it poor man sure must live

 And in her breast enthrone me

 It Is Na Jean Thy Bonie Face

 It is na Jean thy bonie face
 Nor shape that I admire
 Altho thy beauty and thy grace
 Might weel awauk desire

 Something in ilka part o thee
 To praise to love I find
 But dear as is thy form to me
 Still dearer is thy mind

 Nae mair ungenerous wish I hae
 Nor stronger in my breast
 Than if I canna make thee sae
 At least to see thee blest

 Content am I if heaven shall give
 But happiness to thee
 And as wi thee Id wish to live
 For thee Id bear to die

My Bonie Mary

 Go fetch to me a pint o wine
 And fill it in a silver tassie
 That I may drink before I go
 A service to my bonie lassie
 The boat rocks at the pier o Leith
 Fu loud the wind blaws frae the Ferry
 The ship rides by the Berwicklaw
 And I maun leave my bonie Mary

 The trumpets sound the banners fly
 The glittering spears are ranked ready
 The shouts o war are heard afar
 The battle closes deep and bloody
 Its not the roar o sea or shore
 Wad mak me langer wish to tarry
 Nor shouts o war thats heard afar
 Its leaving thee my bonie Mary




The Parting Kiss

 Humid seal of soft affections
 Tenderest pledge of future bliss
 Dearest tie of young connections
 Loves first snowdrop virgin kiss

 Speaking silence dumb confession
 Passions birth and infants play
 Dovelike fondness chaste concession
 Glowing dawn of future day

 Sorrowing joy Adieus last action
 Lingering lips must now disjoin
 What words can ever speak affection
 So thrilling and sincere as thine

 Thou whom chance may hither lead
 Be thou clad in russet weed

 Sprung from nightin darkness lost
 Hope not sunshine evry hour
 Fear not clouds will always lour

 Beneath thy morning star advance
 Pleasure with her siren air
 May delude the thoughtless pair
 Let Prudence bless Enjoyments cup

 Lifes proud summits wouldst thou scale
 Check thy climbing step elate

 Soar around each cliffy hold
 While cheerful Peace with linnet song
 Chants the lowly dells among

 As the shades of evning close
 Beckning thee to long repose
 As life itself becomes disease
 Seek the chimneynook of ease
 There ruminate with sober thought
 On all thoust seen and heard and wrought
 And teach the sportive younkers round

 Say mans true genuine estimate
 The grand criterion of his fate

 That foolish selfish faithless ways

 Sleep whence thou shalt neer awake
 Night where dawn shall never break
 Till future life future no more
 To light and joy the good restore

The Poets Progress

 A Poem In Embryo

 Thou Nature partial Nature I arraign
 Of thy caprice maternal I complain

 The peopled fold thy kindly care have found
 The horned bull tremendous spurns the ground
 The lordly lion has enough and more
 The forest trembles at his very roar
 Thou givst the ass his hide the snail his shell
 The puny wasp victorious guards his cell
 Thy minions kings defend controul devour
 In all th omnipotence of rule and power
 Foxes and statesmen subtle wiles ensure
 The cit and polecat stink and are secure
 Toads with their poison doctors with their drug
 The priest and hedgehog in their robes are snug
 Een silly women have defensive arts
 Their eyes their tonguesand nameless other parts

 But O thou cruel stepmother and hard
 To thy poor fenceless naked child the Bard
 A thing unteachable in worldly skill
 And half an idiot too more helpless still
 No heels to bear him from the opning dun
 No claws to dig his hated sight to shun
 No horns but those by luckless Hymen worn
 And those alas not Amaltheas horn
 No nerves olfactry true to Mammons foot
 Or grunting grub sagacious evils root
 The silly sheep that wanders wild astray
 Is not more friendless is not more a prey
 Vampyrebooksellers drain him to the heart
 And vipercritics cureless venom dart

 Critics applld I venture on the name
 Those cutthroat bandits in the paths of fame
 Bloody dissectors worse than ten Monroes
 He hacks to teach they mangle to expose
 By blockheads daring into madness stung
 His heart by wanton causeless malice wrung
 His wellwon waysthan life itself more dear
 By miscreants torn who neer one sprig must wear
 Foild bleeding torturd in th unequal strife
 The hapless Poet flounces on through life
 Till fled each hope that once his bosom fired
 And fled each Muse that glorious once inspird
 Lowsunk in squalid unprotected age
 Dead even resentment for his injurd page
 He heeds no more the ruthless critics rage

 So by some hedge the generous steed deceasd
 For halfstarvd snarling curs a dainty feast
 By toil and famine worn to skin and bone
 Lies senseless of each tugging bitchs son

 A little upright pert tart tripping wight
 And still his precious self his dear delight
 Who loves his own smart shadow in the streets
 Better than eer the fairest she he meets
 Much specious lore but little understood
 Veneering oft outshines the solid wood
 His solid sense by inches you must tell
 But mete his cunning by the Scottish ell
 A man of fashion too he made his tour
 Learnd vive la bagatelle et vive lamour
 So travelld monkeys their grimace improve
 Polish their grinnay sigh for ladies love
 His meddling vanity a busy fiend
 Still making work his selfish craft must mend

    Crochallan came
 The old cockd hat the brown surtoutthe same
 His grisly beard just bristling in its might
 Twas four long nights and days from shavingnight
 His uncombd hoary locks wildstaring thatchd
 A head for thought profound and clear unmatchd
 Yet tho his caustic wit was bitingrude
 His heart was warm benevolent and good

 O Dulness portion of the truly blest
 Calm shelterd haven of eternal rest
 Thy sons neer madden in the fierce extremes
 Of Fortunes polar frost or torrid beams
 If mantling high she fills the golden cup
 With sober selfish ease they sip it up
 Conscious the bounteous meed they well deserve
 They only wonder some folks do not starve
 The grave sage hern thus easy picks his frog
 And thinks the mallard a sad worthless dog
 When disappointment snaps the thread of Hope
 When thro disastrous night they darkling grope
 With deaf endurance sluggishly they bear
 And just conclude that fools are Fortunes care
 So heavy passive to the tempests shocks
 Strong on the signpost stands the stupid ox

 Not so the idle Muses madcap train
 Not such the workings of their moonstruck brain
 In equanimity they never dwell
 By turns in soaring heaven or vaulted hell




Elegy On The Year 1788

 For lords or kings I dinna mourn
 Een let them diefor that theyre born
 But oh prodigious to reflec
 A Towmont sirs is gane to wreck
 O Eightyeight in thy sma space
 What dire events hae taken place
 Of what enjoyments thou hast reft us
 In what a pickle thou has left us

 The Spanish empires tint a head
 And my auld teethless Bawties dead
 The tulyies teugh tween Pitt and Fox
 And tween our Maggies twa wee cocks
 The tane is game a bluidy devil
 But to the henbirds unco civil
 The tithers something dour o treadin
 But better stuff neer clawd a middin

 Ye ministers come mount the poupit
 An cry till ye be hearse an roupit
 For Eightyeight he wished you weel
 An gied ye a baith gear an meal
 Een monc a plack and mony a peck
 Ye ken yoursels for little feck

 Ye bonie lasses dight your een
 For some o you hae tint a frien
 In Eightyeight ye ken was taen
 What yell neer hae to gie again

 Observe the very nowt an sheep
 How dowff an daviely they creep
 Nay even the yirth itsel does cry
 For Enburgh wells are grutten dry

 O Eightynine thous but a bairn
 An no owre auld I hope to learn
 Thou beardless boy I pray tak care
 Thou now hast got thy Daddys chair
 Nae handcuffd mizld hapshackld Regent
 But like himsel a full free agent
 Be sure ye follow out the plan
 Nae waur than he did honest man
 As muckle better as you can

The Henpecked Husband

 Cursd be the man the poorest wretch in life
 The crouching vassal to a tyrant wife
 Who has no will but by her high permission
 Who has not sixpence but in her possession
 Who must to he his dear friends secrets tell
 Who dreads a curtain lecture worse than hell
 Were such the wife had fallen to my part
 Id break her spirit or Id break her heart
 Id charm her with the magic of a switch
 Id kiss her maids and kick the perverse bitch




Versicles On SignPosts

 His face with smile eternal drest
 Just like the Landlords to his Guests
 High as they hang with creaking din
 To index out the Country Inn
 He looked just as your signpost Lions do
 With aspect fierce and quite as harmless too

 A head pure sinless quite of brain and soul
 The very image of a barbers Poll
 It shews a human face and wears a wig
 And looks when well preservd amazing big

Ode Sacred To The Memory Of Mrs Oswald Of Auchencruive

 Dweller in yon dungeon dark
 Hangman of creation mark
 Who in widowweeds appears
 Laden with unhonourd years
 Noosing with care a bursting purse
 Baited with many a deadly curse



 Strophe

 View the witherd Beldams face
 Can thy keen inspection trace
 Aught of Humanitys sweet melting grace
 Note that eye tis rheum oerflows
 Pitys flood there never rose
 See these hands neer stretched to save
 Hands that took but never gave
 Keeper of Mammons iron chest
 Lo there she goes unpitied and unblest
 She goes but not to realms of everlasting rest



 Antistrophe

 Plunderer of Armies lift thine eyes
 A while forbear ye torturing fiends
 Seest thou whose step unwilling hither bends
 No fallen angel hurld from upper skies
 Tis thy trusty quondam Mate
 Doomd to share thy fiery fate
 She tardy hellward plies



 Epode

 And are they of no more avail
 Ten thousand glittering pounds ayear
 In other worlds can Mammon fail
 Omnipotent as he is here

 O bitter mockery of the pompous bier
 While down the wretched Vital Part is driven
 The cavelodged Beggarwith a conscience clear
 Expires in rags unknown and goes to Heaven




Pegasus At Wanlockhead

 With Pegasus upon a day
 Apollo weary flying
 Through frosty hills the journey lay
 On foot the way was plying

 Poor slipshod giddy Pegasus
 Was but a sorry walker
 To Vulcan then Apollo goes
 To get a frosty caulker

 Obliging Vulcan fell to work
 Threw by his coat and bonnet
 And did Sols business in a crack
 Sol paid him with a sonnet

 Ye Vulcans sons of Wanlockhead
 Pity my sad disaster
 My Pegasus is poorly shod
 Ill pay you like my master




Sappho RedivivusA Fragment

 By all I lovd neglected and forgot
 No friendly face eer lights my squalid cot
 Shunnd hated wrongd unpitied unredrest
 The mockd quotation of the scorners jest
 Evn the poor support of my wretched life
 Snatched by the violence of legal strife
 Oft grateful for my very daily bread
 To those my familys once large bounty fed
 A welcome inmate at their homely fare
 My griefs my woes my sighs my tears they share
 Their vulgar souls unlike the souls refind
 The fashioned marble of the polished mind

 In vain would Prudence with decorous sneer
 Point out a censuring world and bid me fear
 Above the world on wings of Love I rise
 I know its worst and can that worst despise
 Let Prudence direst bodements on me fall
 Montgomery rich reward oerpays them all

 Mild zephyrs waft thee to lifes farthest shore
 Nor think of me and my distress more
 Falsehood accurst No still I beg a place
 Still near thy heart some little little trace
 For that dear trace the world I would resign
 O let me live and die and think it mine

 I burn I burn as when thro ripend corn
 By driving winds the crackling flames are borne
 Now ravingwild I curse that fatal night
 Then bless the hour that charmd my guilty sight
 In vain the laws their feeble force oppose
 Chaind at Loves feet they groan his vanquishd foes
 In vain Religion meets my shrinking eye
 I dare not combat but I turn and fly
 Conscience in vain upbraids th unhallowd fire
 Love grasps her scorpionsstifled they expire
 Reason drops headlong from his sacred throne

 Your dear idea reigns and reigns alone
 Each thought intoxicated homage yields
 And riots wanton in forbidden fields
 By all on high adoring mortals know
 By all the conscious villain fears below
 By your dear selfthe last great oath I swear
 Not life nor soul were ever half so dear




SongShes Fair And Fause

 Shes fair and fause that causes my smart
 I loed her meikle and lang
 Shes broken her vow shes broken my heart
 And I may een gae hang
 A coof cam in wi routh o gear
 And I hae tint my dearest dear
 But Woman is but warlds gear
 Sae let the bonie lass gang

 Whaeer ye be that woman love
 To this be never blind
 Nae ferlie tis tho fickle she prove
 A woman hast by kind
 O Woman lovely Woman fair
 An angel forms faun to thy share
 Twad been oer meikle to gien thee mair
 I mean an angel mind




Impromptu Lines To Captain Riddell

 On Returning a Newspaper

 Your News and Review sir
 Ive read through and through sir
 With little admiring or blaming
 The Papers are barren
 Of homenews or foreign
 No murders or rapes worth the naming

 Our friends the Reviewers
 Those chippers and hewers
 Are judges of mortar and stone sir
 But of meet or unmeet
 In a fabric complete
 Ill boldly pronounce they are none sir

 My goosequill too rude is
 To tell all your goodness
 Bestowd on your servant the Poet
 Would to God I had one
 Like a beam of the sun
 And then all the world sir should know it




Lines To John MMurdo Esq Of Drumlanrig

 Sent with some of the Authors Poems

 O could I give thee Indias wealth
 As I this trifle send
 Because thy joy in both would be
 To share them with a friend

 But golden sands did never grace
 The Heliconian stream
 Then take what gold could never buy
 An honest bards esteem




Rhyming Reply To A Note From Captain Riddell

 Dear Sir at ony time or tide
 Id rather sit wi you than ride
 Though twere wi royal Geordie
 And trowth your kindness soon and late
 Aft gars me to mysel look blate

CaledoniaA Ballad

 TuneCaledonian Hunts Delight of Mr Gow


 There was once a day but old Time wasythen young
 That brave Caledonia the chief of her line
 From some of your northern deities sprung
 Who knows not that brave Caledonias divine
 From Tweed to the Orcades was her domain
 To hunt or to pasture or do what she would
 Her heavnly relations there fixed her reign
 And pledgd her their godheads to warrant it good

 A lambkin in peace but a lion in war
 The pride of her kindred the heroine grew
 Her grandsire old Odin triumphantly swore
 Whoeer shall provoke thee th encounter shall rue
 With tillage or pasture at times she would sport
 To feed her fair flocks by her green rustling corn
 But chiefly the woods were her favrite resort
 Her darling amusement the hounds and the horn

 Long quiet she reigned till thitherward steers
 A flight of bold eagles from Adrias strand
 Repeated successive for many long years
 They darkend the air and they plunderd the land
 Their pounces were murder and terror their cry
 Theyd conquerd and ruind a world beside
 She took to her hills and her arrows let fly
 The daring invaders they fled or they died

 The CameleonSavage disturbd her repose
 With tumult disquiet rebellion and strife
 Provokd beyond bearing at last she arose
 And robbd him at once of his hopes and his life
 The Anglian lion the terror of France
 Oft prowling ensanguind the Tweeds silver flood
 But taught by the bright Caledonian lance
 He learned to fear in his own native wood

 The fell Harpyraven took wing from the north
 The scourge of the seas and the dread of the shore
 The wild Scandinavian boar issued forth
 To wanton in carnage and wallow in gore
 Oer countries and kingdoms their fury prevaild
 No arts could appease them no arms could repel
 But brave Caledonia in vain they assaild
 As Largs well can witness and Loncartie tell

 Thus bold independent unconquerd and free
 Her bright course of glory for ever shall run
 For brave Caledonia immortal must be
 Ill prove it from Euclid as clear as the sun
 Rectangletriangle the figure well chuse
 The upright is Chance and old Time is the base
 But brave Caledonias the hypothenuse
 Then ergo shell match them and match them always




To Miss Cruickshank

 A very Young Lady

Written on the Blank Leaf of a Book presented to her by the Author

 Beauteous Rosebud young and gay
 Blooming in thy early May
 Never mayst thou lovely flower
 Chilly shrink in sleety shower
 Never Boreas hoary path
 Never Eurus poisnous breath
 Never baleful stellar lights
 Taint thee with untimely blights
 Never never reptile thief
 Riot on thy virgin leaf
 Nor even Sol too fiercely view
 Thy bosom blushing still with dew

 Mayst thou long sweet crimson gem
 Richly deck thy native stem
 Till some evning sober calm
 Dropping dews and breathing balm
 While all around the woodland rings
 And evry bird thy requiem sings
 Thou amid the dirgeful sound
 Shed thy dying honours round
 And resign to parent Earth
 The loveliest form she eer gave birth




Beware O Bonie Ann

 Ye gallants bright I rede you right
 Beware o bonie Ann
 Her comely face sae fu o grace
 Your heart she will trepan
 Her een sae bright like stars by night
 Her skin sae like the swan
 Sae jimply lacd her genty waist
 That sweetly ye might span

 Youth Grace and Love attendant move
 And pleasure leads the van
 In a their charms and conquering arms
 They wait on bonie Ann
 The captive bands may chain the hands
 But love enslaves the man
 Ye gallants braw I rede you a
 Beware o bonie Ann




Ode On The Departed Regency Bill

 March 1789

 Daughter of Chaos doting years
 Nurse of ten thousand hopes and fears
 Whether thy airy insubstantial shade
 The rights of sepulture now duly paid
 Spread abroad its hideous form
 On the roaring civil storm
 Deafening din and warring rage
 Factions wild with factions wage
 Or underground deepsunk profound
 Among the demons of the earth
 With groans that make the mountains shake
 Thou mourn thy illstarrd blighted birth
 Or in the uncreated Void
 Where seeds of future being fight
 With lessend step thou wander wide
 To greet thy MotherAncient Night
 And as each jarring monstermass is past
 Fond recollect what once thou wast
 In manner due beneath this sacred oak
 Hear Spirit hear thy presence I invoke
 By a Monarchs heavenstruck fate
 By a disunited State
 By a generous Princes wrongs
 By a Senates strife of tongues
 By a Premiers sullen pride
 Louring on the changing tide
 By dread Thurlows powers to awe
 Rhetoric blasphemy and law
 By the turbulent ocean
 A Nations commotion
 By the harlotcaresses
 Of borough addresses
 By days few and evil
 Thy portion poor devil
 By Power Wealth and Show
 The Gods by men adored
 By nameless Poverty
 Their hell abhorred
 By all they hope by all they fear
 Hear and appear

 Stare not on me thou ghastly Power
 Nor grim with chained defiance lour
 No Babelstructure would I build
 Where order exild from his native sway
 Confusion may the regentsceptre wield
 While all would rule and none obey
 Go to the world of man relate
 The story of thy sad eventful fate
 And call presumptuous Hope to hear
 And bid him check his blind career
 And tell the soreprest sons of Care
 Never never to despair
 Paint Charles speed on wings of fire
 The object of his fond desire
 Beyond his boldest hopes at hand
 Paint all the triumph of the Portland Band
 Hark how they lift the joyelated voice
 And who are these that equally rejoice
 Jews Gentiles what a motley crew
 The iron tears their flinty cheeks bedew
 See how unfurled the parchment ensigns fly
 And Principal and Interest all the cry
 And how their numrous creditors rejoice
 But just as hopes to warm enjoyment rise
 Cry Convalescence and the vision flies
 Then next pourtray a darkning twilight gloom
 Eclipsing sad a gay rejoicing morn
 While proud Ambition to th untimely tomb
 By gnashing grim despairing fiends is borne
 Paint ruin in the shape of high Dundas
 Gaping with giddy terror oer the brow
 In vain he struggles the fates behind him press
 And clamrous hell yawns for her prey below
 How fallen That whose pride late scaled the skies
 And This like Lucifer no more to rise
 Again pronounce the powerful word
 See Day triumphant from the night restored

 Then know this truth ye Sons of Men
 Thus ends thy moral tale
 Your darkest terrors may be vain
 Your brightest hopes may fail




Epistle To James Tennant Of Glenconner

 Auld comrade dear and brither sinner
 Hows a the folk about Glenconner
 How do you this blae eastlin wind
 Thats like to blaw a body blind
 For me my faculties are frozen
 My dearest member nearly dozend
 Ive sent you here by Johnie Simson
 Twa sage philosophers to glimpse on
 Smith wi his sympathetic feeling
 An Reid to common sense appealing
 Philosophers have fought and wrangled
 An meikle Greek an Latin mangled
 Till wi their logicjargon tird
 And in the depth of science mird
 To common sense they now appeal
 What wives and wabsters see and feel
 But hark ye friend I charge you strictly
 Peruse them an return them quickly
 For now Im grown sae cursed douce
 I pray and ponder butt the house
 My shins my lane I there sit roastin
 Perusing Bunyan Brown an Boston
 Till by an by if I haud on
 Ill grunt a real gospelgroan
 Already I begin to try it
 To cast my een up like a pyet
 When by the gun she tumbles oer
 Fluttring an gasping in her gore
 Sae shortly you shall see me bright
 A burning an a shining light

 My heartwarm love to guid auld Glen
 The ace an wale of honest men
 When bending down wi auld grey hairs
 Beneath the load of years and cares
 May He who made him still support him
 An views beyond the grave comfort him
 His worthy famly far and near
 God bless them a wi grace and gear

 My auld schoolfellow Preacher Willie
 The manly tar my masonbillie
 And Auchenbay I wish him joy
 If hes a parent lass or boy
 May he be dad and Meg the mither
 Just fiveandforty years thegither
 And no forgetting wabster Charlie
 Im tauld he offers very fairly
 An Lord remember singing Sannock
 Wi hale breeks saxpence an a bannock
 And next my auld acquaintance Nancy
 Since she is fitted to her fancy
 An her kind stars hae airted till her
 gA guid chiel wi a pickle siller
 My kindest best respects I sen it
 To cousin Kate an sister Janet
 Tell them frae me wi chiels be cautious
 For faith theyll aiblins fin them fashious
 To grant a heart is fairly civil
 But to grant a maidenheads the devil
 An lastly Jamie for yoursel
 May guardian angels tak a spell
 An steer you seven miles south o hell
 But first before you see heavens glory
 May ye get mony a merry story
 Mony a laugh and mony a drink
 And aye eneugh o needfu clink

 Now fare ye weel an joy be wi you
 For my sake this I beg it o you
 Assist poor Simson a ye can
 Yell fin him just an honest man
 Sae I conclude and quat my chanter

A New Psalm For The Chapel Of Kilmarnock

On the ThanksgivingDay for His Majestys Recovery

 O sing a new song to the Lord
 Make all and every one
 A joyful noise even for the King
 His restoration

 The sons of Belial in the land
 Did set their heads together
 Come let us sweep them off said they
 Like an oerflowing river

 They set their heads together I say
 They set their heads together
 On right on left on every hand
 We saw none to deliver

 Thou madest strong two chosen ones
 To quell the Wickeds pride
 That Young Man great in Issachar
 The burdenbearing tribe

 And him among the Princes chief
 In our Jerusalem
 The judge thats mighty in thy law
 The man that fears thy name

 Yet they even they with all their strength
 Began to faint and fail
 Even as two howling ravenous wolves
 To dogs do turn their tail

 Th ungodly oer the just prevaild
 For so thou hadst appointed
 That thou mightst greater glory give
 Unto thine own anointed

 And now thou hast restored our State
 Pity our Kirk also
 For she by tribulations
 Is now brought very low

 Consume that highplace Patronage
 From off thy holy hill
 And in thy fury burn the book
 Even of that man MGill1

 Now hear our prayer accept our song
 And fight thy chosens battle
 We seek but little Lord from thee
 Thou kens we get as little

 Footnote 1 Dr William MGill of Ayr whose Practical
 Essay on the Death of Jesus Christ led to a charge of
 heresy against him Burns took up his cause in The Kirk of
 Scotlands Alarm p 351Lang




Sketch In Verse

 Inscribed to the Right Hon C J Fox

 How wisdom and Folly meet mix and unite
 How Virtue and Vice blend their black and their white
 How Genius th illustrious father of fiction
 Confounds rule and law reconciles contradiction
 I sing If these mortals the critics should bustle
 I care not not Ilet the Critics go whistle

 But now for a Patron whose name and whose glory
 At once may illustrate and honour my story

 Thou first of our orators first of our wits
 Yet whose parts and acquirements seem just lucky hits
 With knowledge so vast and with judgment so strong
 No man with the half of em eer could go wrong
 With passions so potent and fancies so bright
 No man with the half of em eer could go right
 A sorry poor misbegot son of the Muses
 For using thy name offers fifty excuses
 Good Lord what is Man for as simple he looks
 Do but try to develop his hooks and his crooks
 With his depths and his shallows his good and his evil
 All in all hes a problem must puzzle the devil

 On his one ruling passion Sir Pope hugely labours
 That like th old Hebrew walkingswitch eats up its neighbours
 Mankind are his showboxa friend would you know him
 Pull the string Ruling Passion the picture will show him
 What pity in rearing so beauteous a system
 One trifling particular Truth should have missd him
 For spite of his fine theoretic positions
 Mankind is a science defies definitions

 Some sort all our qualities each to its tribe
 And think human nature they truly describe
 Have you found this or tother Theres more in the wind
 As by one drunken fellow his comrades youll find
 But such is the flaw or the depth of the plan
 In the make of that wonderful creature called Man
 No two virtues whatever relation they claim
 Nor even two different shades of the same
 Though like as was ever twin brother to brother
 Possessing the one shall imply youve the other

 But truce with abstraction and truce with a Muse
 Whose rhymes youll perhaps Sir neer deign to peruse
 Will you leave your justings your jars and your quarrels
 Contending with Billy for proudnodding laurels
 My muchhonourd Patron believe your poor poet
 Your courage much more than your prudence you show it
 In vain with Squire Billy for laurels you struggle
 Hell have them by fair trade if not he will smuggle
 Not cabinets even of kings would conceal em
 Hed up the back stairs and by God he would steal em
 Then feats like Squire Billys you neer can achieve em
 It is not outdo himthe task is outthieve him




The Wounded Hare

 Inhuman man curse on thy barbrous art
 And blasted be thy murderaiming eye
 May never pity soothe thee with a sigh
 Nor ever pleasure glad thy cruel heart

 Go live poor wandrer of the wood and field
 The bitter little that of life remains
 No more the thickening brakes and verdant plains
 To thee a home or food or pastime yield

 Seek mangled wretch some place of wonted rest
 No more of rest but now thy dying bed
 The sheltering rushes whistling oer thy head
 The cold earth with thy bloody bosom prest

 Perhaps a mothers anguish adds its woe
 The playful pair crowd fondly by thy side
 Ah helpless nurslings who will now provide
 That life a mother only can bestow

 Oft as by winding Nith I musing wait
 The sober eve or hail the cheerful dawn
 Ill miss thee sporting oer the dewy lawn
 And curse the ruffians aim and mourn thy hapless fate

 Ellisland near Dumfries 18th May 1789


 Fair the face of orient day
 Fair the tints of opning rose
 But fairer still my Delia dawns
 More lovely far her beauty shows

 Sweet the larks wild warbled lay
 Sweet the tinkling rill to hear
 But Delia more delightful still
 Steal thine accents on mine ear

 The flowerenamourd busy bee
 The rosy banquet loves to sip
 Sweet the streamlets limpid lapse
 To the sunbrownd Arabs lip

 But Delia on thy balmy lips
 Let me no vagrant insect rove
 O let me steal one liquid kiss
 For Oh my soul is parchd with love




The Gardner Wi His Paidle

 TuneThe Gardeners March


 When rosy May comes in wi flowers
 To deck her gay greenspreading bowers
 Then busy busy are his hours
 The Gardner wi his paidle

 The crystal waters gently fa
 The merry bards are lovers a
 The scented breezes round him blaw
 The Gardner wi his paidle

 When purple morning starts the hare
 To steal upon her early fare
 Then thro the dews he maun repair
 The Gardner wi his paidle

 When day expiring in the west
 The curtain draws o Natures rest
 He flies to her arms he loes the best

On A Bank Of Flowers

 On a bank of flowers in a summer day
 For summer lightly drest
 The youthful blooming Nelly lay
 With love and sleep opprest
 When Willie wandring thro the wood
 Who for her favour oft had sued
 He gazd he wishd
 He feard he blushd
 And trembled where he stood

 Her closed eyes like weapons sheathd
 Were seald in soft repose
 Her lip still as she fragrant breathd
 It richer dyed the rose
 The springing lilies sweetly prest
 Wildwanton kissed her rival breast
 He gazd he wishd
 He meard he blushd
 His bosom ill at rest

 Her robes lightwaving in the breeze
 Her tender limbs embrace
 Her lovely form her native ease
 All harmony and grace
 Tumultuous tides his pulses roll
 A faltering ardent kiss he stole
 He gazd he wishd
 He feard he blushd
 And sighd his very soul

 As flies the partridge from the brake
 On fearinspired wings
 So Nelly starting halfawake
 Away affrighted springs
 But Willie followdas he should
 He overtook her in the wood
 He vowd he prayd
 He found the maid
 Forgiving all and good

 Thro wind and weet thro frost and snaw
 And oer the lea I leuk fu fain
 When Jockies owsen hameward ca

 An aye the night comes round again
 When in his arms he taks me a
 An aye he vows hell be my ain
 As langs he has a breath to draw




The Banks Of Nith

 The Thames flows proudly to the sea
 Where royal cities stately stand
 But sweeter flows the Nith to me
 Where Comyns ance had high command
 When shall I see that honourd land
 That winding stream I love so dear
 Must wayward Fortunes adverse hand
 For ever ever keep me here

 How lovely Nith thy fruitful vales
 Where bounding hawthorns gaily bloom
 And sweetly spread thy sloping dales
 Where lambkins wanton through the broom
 Tho wandering now must be my doom
 Far from thy bonie banks and braes
 May there my latest hours consume
 Amang the friends of early days

On The Late Captain Groses Peregrinations Thro Scotland

 Collecting The Antiquities Of That Kingdom


 Hear Land o Cakes and brither Scots
 Frae Maidenkirk to Johnie Groats
 If theres a hole in a your coats
 I rede you tent it
 A chields amang you takin notes
 And faith hell prent it

 If in your bounds ye chance to light
 Upon a fine fat fodgel wight
 O stature short but genius bright
 Thats he mark weel
 And wow he has an unco sleight
 O cauk and keel

 By some auld houlethaunted biggin
 Or kirk deserted by its riggin
 Its ten to ane yell find him snug in
 Some eldritch part
 Wi deils they say Lord saves colleaguin
 At some black art

 Ilk ghaist that haunts auld ha or chaumer
 Ye gipsygang that deal in glamour
 And you deepread in hells black grammar
 Warlocks and witches
 Yell quake at his conjuring hammer
 Ye midnight bitches

 Its tauld he was a sodger bred
 And ane wad rather fan than fled
 But now hes quat the spurtleblade
 And dogskin wallet
 And taen theAntiquarian trade
 I think they call it

 He has a fouth o auld nicknackets
 Rusty airn caps and jinglin jackets
 Wad haud the Lothians three in tackets
 A towmont gude
 And parritchpats and auld sautbackets
 Before the Flood

 Of Eves first fire he has a cinder
 Auld Tubalcains fireshool and fender
 That which distinguished the gender
 O Balaams ass
 A broomstick o the witch of Endor
 Weel shod wi brass

 Forbye hell shape you aff fu gleg
 The cut of Adams philibeg
 The knife that nickit Abels craig
 Hell prove you fully
 It was a faulding jocteleg
 Or langkail gullie

 But wad ye see him in his glee
 For meikle glee and fun has he
 Then set him down and twa or three
 Gude fellows wi him
 And port O port shine thou a wee
 And Then yell see him

 Now by the Powrs o verse and prose
 Thou art a dainty chield O Grose
 Whaeer o thee shall ill suppose
 They sair misca thee
 Id take the rascal by the nose
 Wad say Shame fa thee




Epigram On Francis Grose The Antiquary

 The Devil got notice that Grose was adying
 So whip at the summons old Satan came flying
 But when he approached where poor Francis lay moaning
 And saw each bedpost with its burthen agroaning
 Astonishd confounded cries SatanBy God
 Ill want him ere I take such a damnable load

Sonnet On Receiving A Favour

 10 Aug 1979

 Addressed to Robert Graham Esq of Fintry

 I call no Goddess to inspire my strains
 A fabled Muse may suit a bard that feigns
 Friend of my life my ardent spirit burns
 And all the tribute of my heart returns
 For boons accorded goodness ever new
 The gifts still dearer as the giver you
 Thou orb of day thou other paler light
 And all ye many sparkling stars of night
 If aught that giver from my mind efface
 If I that givers bounty eer disgrace
 Then roll to me along your wandrig spheres
 Only to number out a villains years
 I lay my hand upon my swelling breast
 And grateful would but cannot speak the rest

The Battle Of Sherramuir

 TuneThe Cameronian Rant


 O cam ye here the fight to shun
 Or herd the sheep wi me man
 Or were ye at the Sherramoor
 Or did the battle see man
 I saw the battle sair and teugh
 And reekinred ran mony a sheugh
 My heart for fear gaed sough for sough
 To hear the thuds and see the cluds
 O clans frae woods in tartan duds
 Wha glaumd at kingdoms three man
 La la la la c

 The redcoat lads wi black cockauds
 To meet them were na slaw man
 They rushd and pushd and blude outgushd
 And mony a bouk did fa man
 The great Argyle led on his files
 I wat they glanced twenty miles
 They houghd the clans like ninepin kyles
 They hackd and hashd while braidswords clashd
 And thro they dashd and hewd and smashd
 Till fey men died awa man
 La la la la c

 But had ye seen the philibegs
 And skyrin tartan trews man
 When in the teeth they dard our Whigs
 And covenant Trueblues man
 In lines extended lang and large
 When baiginets oerpowerd the targe
 And thousands hastend to the charge
 Wi Highland wrath they frae the sheath
 Drew blades o death till out o breath
 They fled like frighted dows man
 La la la la c

 O how deil Tam can that be true
 The chase gaed frae the north man
 I saw mysel they did pursue
 The horsemen back to Forth man
 And at Dunblane in my ain sight
 They took the brig wi a their might
 And straught to Stirling wingd their flight
 But cursed lot the gates were shut
 And mony a huntit poor redcoat
 For fear amaist did swarf man
 La la la la c

 My sister Kate cam up the gate
 Wi crowdie unto me man
 She swoor she saw some rebels run
 To Perth unto Dundee man
 Their lefthand general had nae skill
 The Angus lads had nae gude will
 That day their neibors blude to spill
 For fear for foes that they should lose
 Their cogs o brose they scard at blows
 And hameward fast did flee man
 La la la la c

 Theyve lost some gallant gentlemen
 Amang the Highland clans man
 I fear my Lord Panmure is slain
 Or fallen in Whiggish hands man
 Now wad ye sing this double fight
 Some fell for wrang and some for right
 But mony bade the world gudenight
 Then ye may tell how pell and mell
 By red claymores and muskets knell
 Wi dying yell the Tories fell
 And Whigs to hell did flee man

The Captive Ribband

 TuneRobaidh dona gorach


 Dear Myra the captive ribbands mine
 Twas all my faithful love could gain
 And would you ask me to resign
 The sole reward that crowns my pain

 Go bid the hero who has run
 Thro fields of death to gather fame
 Go bid him lay his laurels down
 And all his wellearnd praise disclaim

 The ribband shall its freedom lose
 Lose all the bliss it had with you
 And share the fate I would impose
 On thee wert thou my captive too

 It shall upon my bosom live
 Or clasp me in a close embrace
 And at its fortune if you grieve
 Retrieve its doom and take its place

 TuneFailte na Miosg


 Farewell to the Highlands farewell to the North
 The birthplace of Valour the country of Worth
 Wherever I wander wherever I rove
 The hills of the Highlands for ever I love

 ChorusMy hearts in the Highlands my heart is not here
 My hearts in the Highlands achasing the deer
 Chasing the wilddeer and following the roe
 My hearts in the Highlands wherever I go

 Farewell to the mountains highcoverd with snow
 Farewell to the straths and green vallies below
 Farewell to the forests and wildhanging woods
 Farewell to the torrents and loudpouring floods
 My hearts in the Highlands c




The WhistleA Ballad

 I sing of a Whistle a Whistle of worth
 I sing of a Whistle the pride of the North
 Was brought to the court of our good Scottish King
 And long with this Whistle all Scotland shall ring

 Old Loda still rueing the arm of Fingal
 The god of the bottle sends down from his hall
 The Whistles your challenge to Scotland get oer
 And drink them to hell Sir or neer see me more

 Old poets have sung and old chronicles tell
 What champions venturd what champions fell
 The son of great Loda was conqueror still
 And blew on the Whistle their requiem shrill

 Till Robert the lord of the Cairn and the Scaur
 Unmatchd at the bottle unconquerd in war
 He drank his poor godship as deep as the sea
 No tide of the Baltic eer drunker than he

 Thus Robert victorious the trophy has gaind
 Which now in his house has for ages remaind
 Till three noble chieftains and all of his blood
 The jovial contest again have renewd

 Three joyous good fellows with hearts clear of flaw
 Craigdarroch so famous for with worth and law
 And trusty Glenriddel so skilld in old coins
 And gallant Sir Robert deepread in old wines

 Craigdarroch began with a tongue smooth as oil
 Desiring Downrightly to yield up the spoil
 Or else he would muster the heads of the clan
 And once more in claret try which was the man

 By the gods of the ancients Downrightly replies
 Before I surrender so glorious a prize
 Ill conjure the ghost of the great Rorie More
 And bumper his horn with him twenty times oer

 Sir Robert a soldier no speech would pretend
 But he neer turnd his back on his foe or his friend
 Said Toss down the Whistle the prize of the field
 And kneedeep in claret hed die ere hed yield

 To the board of Glenriddel our heroes repair
 So noted for drowning of sorrow and care
 But for wine and for welcome not more known to fame
 Than the sense wit and taste of a sweet lovely dame

 A bard was selected to witness the fray
 And tell future ages the feats of the day
 A Bard who detested all sadness and spleen
 And wishd that Parnassus a vineyard had been

 The dinner being over the claret they ply
 And evry new cork is a new spring of joy
 In the bands of old friendship and kindred so set
 And the bands grew the tighter the more they were wet

 Gay Pleasure ran riot as bumpers ran oer
 Bright Phoebus neer witnessd so joyous a core
 And vowd that to leave them he was quite forlorn
 Till Cynthia hinted hed see them next morn

 Six bottles apiece had well wore out the night
 When gallant Sir Robert to finish the fight
 Turnd oer in one bumper a bottle of red
 And swore twas the way that their ancestor did

 Then worthy Glenriddel so cautious and sage
 No longer the warfare ungodly would wage
 A high Ruling Elder to wallow in wine
 He left the foul business to folks less divine

 The gallant Sir Robert fought hard to the end
 But who can with Fate and quart bumpers contend
 Though Fate said a hero should perish in light
 So uprose bright Phoebusand down fell the knight

 Next uprose our Bard like a prophet in drink
 Craigdarroch thoult soar when creation shall sink
 But if thou would flourish immortal in rhyme
 Comeone bottle moreand have at the sublime

 Thy line that have struggled for freedom with Bruce
 Shall heroes and patriots ever produce
 So thine be the laurel and mine be the bay
 The field thou hast won by yon bright god of day




To Mary In Heaven

 Thou lingring star with lessening ray
 That lovst to greet the early morn
 Again thou usherst in the day
 My Mary from my soul was torn
 O Mary dear departed shade
 Where is thy place of blissful rest
 Seest thou thy lover lowly laid
 Hearst thou the groans that rend his breast

 That sacred hour can I forget
 Can I forget the hallowd grove
 Where by the winding Ayr we met
 To live one day of parting love
 Eternity will not efface
 Those records dear of transports past
 Thy image at our last embrace
 Ah little thought we twas our last

 Ayr gurgling kissd his pebbled shore
 Oerhung with wildwoods thickening green
 The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar
 Twind amorous round the rapturd scene
 The flowers sprang wanton to be prest
 The birds sang love on every spray
 Till too too soon the glowing west
 Proclaimd the speed of winged day

 Still oer these scenes my memry wakes
 And fondly broods with misercare
 Time but th impression stronger makes
 As streams their channels deeper wear
 My Mary dear departed shade
 Where is thy blissful place of rest
 Seest thou thy lover lowly laid
 Hearst thou the groans that rend his breast




Epistle To Dr Blacklock

 Ellisland 21st Oct 1789

 Wow but your letter made me vauntie
 And are ye hale and weel and cantie
 I kend it still your wee bit jauntie
 Wad bring ye to
 Lord send you aye as weels I want ye
 And then yell do

 The illthief blaw the Heron south
 And never drink be near his drouth
 He tauld myself by word o mouth
 Hed tak my letter
 I lippend to the chiel in trouth
 And bade nae better

 But aiblins honest Master Heron
 Had at the time some dainty fair one
 To ware this theologic care on
 And holy study
 And tired o sauls to waste his lear on
 Een tried the body

 But what dye think my trusty fere
 Im turned a gaugerPeace be here
 Parnassian queans I fear I fear
 Yell now disdain me
 And then my fifty pounds a year
 Will little gain me

 Ye glaikit gleesome dainty damies
 Wha by Castalias wimplin streamies
 Lowp sing and lave your pretty limbies
 Ye ken ye ken
 That strang necessity supreme is
 Mang sons o men

 I hae a wife and twa wee laddies
 They maun hae brose and brats o duddies
 Ye ken yoursels my heart right proud is
 I need na vaunt
 But Ill sned besoms thraw saugh woodies
 Before they want

 Lord help me thro this warld o care
 Im weary sick ot late and air
 Not but I hae a richer share
 Than mony ithers
 But why should ae man better fare
 And a men brithers

 Come Firm Resolve take thou the van
 Thou stalk o carlhemp in man
 And let us mind faint heart neer wan
 A lady fair
 Wha does the utmost that he can
 Will whiles do mair

 But to conclude my silly rhyme
 Im scant o verse and scant o time
 To make a happy fireside clime
 To weans and wife
 Thats the true pathos and sublime
 Of human life

 My compliments to sister Beckie
 And eke the same to honest Lucky
 I wat she is a daintie chuckie
 As eer tread clay
 And gratefully my gude auld cockie
 Im yours for aye

The Five Carlins

 An Election Ballad

 TuneChevy Chase


 There was five Carlins in the South
 They fell upon a scheme
 To send a lad to London town
 To bring them tidings hame

 Nor only bring them tidings hame
 But do their errands there
 And aiblins gowd and honor baith
 Might be that laddies share

 There was Maggy by the banks o Nith
 A dame wi pride eneugh
 And Marjory o the mony Lochs
 A Carlin auld and teugh

 And blinkin Bess of Annandale
 That dwelt near Solwayside
 And whisky Jean that took her gill
 In Galloway sae wide

 And auld black Joan frae Crichton Peel1
 O gipsy kith an kin
 Five wighter Carlins were na found
 The South countrie within

 To send a lad to London town
 They met upon a day
 And mony a knight and mony a laird
 This errand fain wad gae

 O mony a knight and mony a laird
 This errand fain wad gae
 But nae ane could their fancy please
 O neer a ane but twae

 The first ane was a belted Knight
 Bred of a Border band2
 And he wad gae to London town
 Might nae man him withstand

 And he wad do their errands weel
 And meikle he wad say
 And ilka ane about the court
 Wad bid to him gudeday

 Footnote 1 Sanquhar

 Footnote 2 Sir James Johnston of Westerhall

 The neist cam in a Soger youth3
 Who spak wi modest grace
 And he wad gae to London town
 If sae their pleasure was

 He wad na hecht them courtly gifts
 Nor meikle speech pretend
 But he wad hecht an honest heart
 Wad neer desert his friend

 Now wham to chuse and wham refuse
 At strife thir Carlins fell
 For some had Gentlefolks to please
 And some wad please themsel

 Then out spak mimmoud Meg o Nith
 And she spak up wi pride
 And she wad send the Soger youth
 Whatever might betide

 For the auld Gudeman o London court4
 She didna care a pin
 But she wad send the Soger youth
 To greet his eldest son5

 Then up sprang Bess o Annandale
 And a deadly aith shes taen
 That she wad vote the Border Knight
 Though she should vote her lane

 For faroff fowls hae feathers fair
 And fools o change are fain
 But I hae tried the Border Knight
 And Ill try him yet again

 Says black Joan frae Crichton Peel
 A Carlin stoor and grim
 The auld Gudeman or young Gudeman
 For me may sink or swim

 But the Sogers friends hae blawn the best
 So he shall bear the horn

 Then whisky Jean spak owre her drink
 Ye weel ken kimmers a
 The auld gudeman o London court
 His backs been at the wa

 And mony a friend that kissd his caup
 Is now a fremit wight
 But its neer be said o whisky Jean
 Well send the Border Knight

 Then slow raise Marjory o the Lochs
 And wrinkled was her brow
 Her ancient weed was russet gray
 Her auld Scots bluid was true

 Theres some great folk set light by me
 I set as light by them
 But I will send to London town
 Wham I like best at hame

 Sae how this mighty plea may end
 Nae mortal wight can tell
 God grant the King and ilka man
 May look weel to himsel

Prologue Spoken At The Theatre Of Dumfries

 On New Years Day Evening 1790

 No song nor dance I bring from yon great city
 That queens it oer our tastethe mores the pity
 Tho by the bye abroad why will you roam
 Good sense and taste are natives here at home
 But not for panegyric I appear
 I come to wish you all a good New Year
 Old Father Time deputes me here before ye
 Not for to preach but tell his simple story
 The sage grave Ancient coughd and bade me say
 Youre one year older this important day
 If wiser toohe hinted some suggestion
 But twould be rude you know to ask the question
 And with a wouldbe roguish leer and wink
 SaidSutherland in one word bid them Think

 Ye sprightly youths quite flush with hope and spirit
 Who think to storm the world by dint of merit
 To you the dotard has a deal to say
 In his sly dry sententious proverb way
 He bids you mind amid your thoughtless rattle
 That the first blow is ever half the battle
 That tho some by the skirt may try to snatch him
 Yet by the foreclock is the hold to catch him
 That whether doing suffering or forbearing
 You may do miracles by persevering

 Last tho not least in love ye youthful fair
 Angelic forms high Heavens peculiar care
 To you old Baldpate smoothes his wrinkled brow
 And humbly begs youll mind the importantNow
 To crown your happiness he asks your leave
 And offers bliss to give and to receive

 For our sincere tho haply weak endeavours
 With grateful pride we own your many favours
 And howsoeer our tongues may ill reveal it
 Believe our glowing bosoms truly feel it

SketchNew Years Day 1790

 To Mrs Dunlop


 This day Time winds th exhausted chain
 To run the twelvemonths length again
 I see the old baldpated fellow
 With ardent eyes complexion sallow
 Adjust the unimpaird machine
 To wheel the equal dull routine

 The absent lover minor heir
 In vain assail him with their prayer
 Deaf as my friend he sees them press
 Nor makes the hour one moment less
 Will you the Majors with the hounds
 The happy tenants share his rounds
 Coilas fair Rachels care today
 And blooming Keiths engaged with Gray
 From housewife cares a minute borrow
 That grandchilds cap will do tomorrow
 And join with me amoralizing
 This days propitious to be wise in

 First what did yesternight deliver
 Another year has gone for ever
 And what is this days strong suggestion
 The passing moments all we rest on
 Rest onfor what what do we here
 Or why regard the passing year
 Will Time amusd with proverbd lore
 Add to our date one minute more
 A few days maya few years must
 Repose us in the silent dust
 Then is it wise to damp our bliss
 Yesall such reasonings are amiss
 The voice of Nature loudly cries
 And many a message from the skies
 That something in us never dies
 That on his frail uncertain state
 Hang matters of eternal weight
 That future life in worlds unknown
 Must take its hue from this alone
 Whether as heavenly glory bright
 Or dark as Miserys woeful night

 Since then my honourd first of friends
 On this poor being all depends
 Let us th important now employ
 And live as those who never die
 Tho you with days and honours crownd
 Witness that filial circle round
 A sight lifes sorrows to repulse
 A sight pale Envy to convulse
 Others now claim your chief regard
 Yourself you wait your bright reward




Scots Prologue For Mr Sutherland

 On his BenefitNight at the Theatre Dumfries


 What needs this din about the town o Lonon
 How this new play an that new sang is comin
 Why is outlandish stuff sae meikle courted
 Does nonsense mend like brandy when imported
 Is there nae poet burning keen for fame
 Will try to gie us sangs and plays at hame
 For Comedy abroad he need to toil
 A fool and knave are plants of every soil
 Nor need he hunt as far as Rome or Greece
 To gather matter for a serious piece
 Theres themes enow in Caledonian story
 Would shew the Tragic Muse in a her glory

 Is there no daring Bard will rise and tell
 How glorious Wallace stood how hapless fell
 Where are the Muses fled that could produce
 A drama worthy o the name o Bruce
 How here even here he first unsheathd the sword
 Gainst mighty England and her guilty Lord
 And after mony a bloody deathless doing
 Wrenchd his dear country from the jaws of Ruin
 O for a Shakespeare or an Otway scene
 To draw the lovely hapless Scottish Queen
 Vain all th omnipotence of female charms
 Gainst headlong ruthless mad Rebellions arms
 She fell but fell with spirit truly Roman
 To glut that direst foea vengeful woman
 A woman tho the phrase may seem uncivil
 As able and as wicked as the Devil
 One Douglas lives in Homes immortal page
 But Douglasses were heroes every age
 And tho your fathers prodigal of life
 A Douglas followed to the martial strife
 Perhaps if bowls row right and Right succeeds
 Ye yet may follow where a Douglas leads

 As ye hae generous done if a the land
 Would take the Muses servants by the hand
 Not only hear but patronize befriend them
 And where he justly can commend commend them
 And aiblins when they winna stand the test
 Wink hard and say The folks hae done their best
 Would a the land do this then Ill be caition
 Yell soon hae Poets o the Scottish nation
 Will gar Fame blaw until her trumpet crack
 And warsle Time an lay him on his back

 For us and for our Stage should ony spier
 Whase aught thae chiels maks a this bustle here
 My best leg foremost Ill set up my brow
 We have the honour to belong to you
 Were your ain bairns een guide us as ye like
 But like good mithers shore before ye strike
 And gratefu still I trust yell ever find us
 For genrous patronage and meikle kindness
 Weve got frae a professions sets and ranks
 God help us were but pooryese get but thanks




Lines To A Gentleman

 Who had sent the Poet a Newspaper and offered
 to continue it free of Expense

 Kind Sir Ive read your paper through
 And faith to me twas really new
 How guessed ye Sir what maist I wanted
 This mony a day Ive graind and gaunted
 To ken what French mischief was brewin
 Or what the drumlie Dutch were doin
 That vile doupskelper Emperor Joseph
 If Venus yet had got his nose off
 Or how the collieshangie works
 Atween the Russians and the Turks
 Or if the Swede before he halt
 Would play anither Charles the twalt
 If Denmark any body spak ot
 Or Poland wha had now the tack ot
 How cutthroat Prussian blades were hingin
 How libbet Italy was singin

 If Spaniard Portuguese or Swiss
 Were sayin or takin aught amiss
 Or how our merry lads at hame
 In Britains court kept up the game
 How royal George the Lord leuk oer him
 Was managing St Stephens quorum
 If sleekit Chatham Will was livin
 Or glaikit Charlie got his nieve in
 How daddie Burke the plea was cookin
 If Warren Hastings neck was yeukin
 How cesses stents and fees were raxd
 Or if bare arses yet were taxd
 The news o princes dukes and earls
 Pimps sharpers bawds and operagirls
 If that daft buckie Geordie Wales
 Was threshing still at hizzies tails
 Or if he was grown oughtlins douser
 And no a perfect kintra cooser
 A this and mair I never heard of
 And but for you I might despaird of
 So gratefu back your news I send you
 And pray a gude things may attend you

Elegy On Willie Nicols Mare

 Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare
 As ever trod on airn
 But now shes floating down the Nith
 And past the mouth o Cairn

 Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare
 An rode thro thick and thin
 But now shes floating down the Nith
 And wanting even the skin

 Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare
 And ance she bore a priest
 But now shes floating down the Nith
 For Solway fish a feast

 Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare
 An the priest he rode her sair
 And much oppressd and bruisd she was
 As priestrid cattle arec c




The Gowden Locks Of Anna

 Yestreen I had a pint o wine
 A place where body saw na
 Yestreen lay on this breast o mine
 The gowden locks of Anna

 The hungry Jew in wilderness
 Rejoicing oer his manna
 Was naething to my hinny bliss
 Upon the lips of Anna

 Ye monarchs take the East and West
 Frae Indus to Savannah
 Gie me within my straining grasp
 The melting form of Anna

 There Ill despise Imperial charms
 An Empress or Sultana
 While dying raptures in her arms
 I give and take wi Anna

 Awa thou flaunting God of Day
 Awa thou pale Diana
 Ilk Star gae hide thy twinkling ray
 When Im to meet my Anna

 Come in thy raven plumage Night
 Sun Moon and Stars withdrawn a
 And bring an angelpen to write
 My transports with my Anna




Postscript

 The Kirk an State may join an tell
 To do sic things I maunna
 The Kirk an State may gae to hell
 And Ill gae to my Anna

 She is the sunshine o my ee
 To live but her I canna
 Had I on earth but wishes three
 The first should be my Anna




SongI Murder Hate

 I murder hate by flood or field
 Tho glorys name may screen us
 In wars at home Ill spend my blood
 Lifegiving wars of Venus
 The deities that I adore
 Are social Peace and Plenty
 Im better pleasd to make one more
 Than be the death of twenty

 I would not die like Socrates
 For all the fuss of Plato
 Nor would I with Leonidas
 Nor yet would I with Cato
 The zealots of the Church and State
 Shall neer my mortal foes be
 But let me have bold Zimris fate
 Within the arms of Cozbi




Gudewife Count The Lawin

 Gane is the day and mirks the night
 But well neer stray for faut o light
 Gude ale and bratdys stars and moon

 And bring a coggie mair

 Theres wealth and ease for gentlemen
 And simple folk maun fecht and fen
 But here were a in ae accord
 For ilka man thats drunks a lord

 My coggie is a haly pool
 That heals the wounds o care and dool
 And Pleasure is a wanton trout
 An ye drink it a yell find him out

Election Ballad

At the close of the contest for representing the Dumfries Burghs 1790

 Addressed to R Graham Esq of Fintry

 Fintry my stay in wordly strife
 Friend o my muse friend o my life
 Are ye as idles I am
 Come then wi uncouth kintra fleg
 Oer Pegasus Ill fling my leg
 And ye shall see me try him

 But where shall I go rin a ride
 That I may splatter nane beside
 I wad na be uncivil
 In manhoods various paths and ways
 Theres aye some doytin body strays
 And I ride like the devil

 Thus I break aff wi a my birr
 And down yon dark deep alley spur
 Where Theologics daunder
 Alas curst wi eternal fogs
 And damnd in everlasting bogs
 As sures the creed Ill blunder

 Ill stain a band or jaup a gown
 Or rin my reckless guilty crown
 Against the haly door
 Sair do I rue my luckless fate
 When as the Muse an Deil wad haet
 I rade that road before

 Suppose I take a spurt and mix
 Amang the wilds o Politics
 Electors and elected
 Where dogs at Court sad sons of bitches
 Septennially a madness touches
 Till all the lands infected

 All hail Drumlanrigs haughty Grace
 Discarded remnant of a race
 Once godlikegreat in story
 Thy forbears virtues all contrasted
 The very name of Douglas blasted
 Thine that inverted glory

 Hate envy oft the Douglas bore
 But thou hast superadded more
 And sunk them in contempt
 Follies and crimes have staind the name
 But Queensberry thine the virgin claim
 From aught thats good exempt

 Ill sing the zeal Drumlanrig bears
 Who left the allimportant cares
 Of princes and their darlings
 And bent on winning borough touns
 Came shaking hands wi wabsterloons
 And kissing barefit carlins

 Combustion thro our boroughs rode
 Whistling his roaring pack abroad
 Of mad unmuzzled lions
 As Queensberry blue and buff unfurld
 And Westerha and Hopetoun hurled
 To every Whig defiance

 But cautious Queensberry left the war
 Th unmannerd dust might soil his star
 Besides he hated bleeding
 But left behind him heroes bright
 Heroes in Caesarean fight
 Or Ciceronian pleading

 O for a throat like huge MonsMeg
 To muster oer each ardent Whig
 Beneath Drumlanrigs banners
 Heroes and heroines commix
 All in the field of politics
 To win immortal honours

 MMurdo and his lovely spouse
 Th enamourd laurels kiss her brows
 Led on the Loves and Graces
 She won each gaping burgess heart
 While he sub rosa played his part
 Amang their wives and lasses

 Craigdarroch led a lightarmd core
 Tropes metaphors and figures pour
 Like Hecla streaming thunder
 Glenriddel skilld in rusty coins
 Blew up each Torys dark designs
 And bared the treason under

 In either wing two champions fought
 Redoubted Staig who set at nought
 The wildest savage Tory
 And Welsh who neer yet flinchd his ground
 Highwavd his magnumbonum round
 With Cyclopeian fury

 Miller brought up th artillery ranks
 The manypounders of the Banks
 Resistless desolation
 While Maxwelton that baron bold
 Mid Lawsons port entrenchd his hold
 And threatend worse damnation

 To these what Tory hosts opposd
 With these what Tory warriors closd
 Surpasses my descriving
 Squadrons extended long and large
 With furious speed rush to the charge
 Like furious devils driving

 What verse can sing what prose narrate
 The butcher deeds of bloody Fate
 Amid this mighty tulyie
 Grim Horror girnd pale Terror roard
 As Murder at his thrapple shord
 And Hell mixd in the brulyie

 As Highland craigs by thunder cleft
 When lightnings fire the stormy lift
 Hurl down with crashing rattle
 As flames among a hundred woods
 As headlong foam from a hundred floods
 Such is the rage of Battle

 The stubborn Tories dare to die
 As soon the rooted oaks would fly
 Before th approaching fellers
 The Whigs come on like Oceans roar
 When all his wintry billows pour
 Against the Buchan Bullers

 Lo from the shades of Deaths deep night
 Departed Whigs enjoy the fight
 And think on former daring
 The muffled murtherer of Charles
 The Magna Charter flag unfurls
 All deadly gules its bearing

 Nor wanting ghosts of Tory fame
 Bold Scrimgeour follows gallant Graham
 Auld Covenanters shiver
 Forgive forgive muchwrongd Montrose
 Now Death and Hell engulph thy foes
 Thou livst on high for ever

 Still oer the field the combat burns
 The Tories Whigs give way by turns
 But Fate the word has spoken
 For womans wit and strength oman
 Alas can do but what they can
 The Tory ranks are broken

 O that my een were flowing burns
 My voice a lioness that mourns
 Her darling cubs undoing
 That I might greet that I might cry
 While Tories fall while Tories fly
 And furious Whigs pursuing

 What Whig but melts for good Sir James
 Dear to his country by the names
 Friend Patron Benefactor
 Not Pulteneys wealth can Pulteney save
 And Hopetoun falls the generous brave
 And Stewart bold as Hector

 Thou Pitt shalt rue this overthrow
 And Thurlow growl a curse of woe
 And Melville melt in wailing
 Now Fox and Sheridan rejoice
 And Burke shall sing O Prince arise
 Thy power is allprevailing

 For your poor friend the Bard afar
 He only hears and sees the war
 A cool spectator purely
 So when the storm the forest rends
 The robin in the hedge descends
 And sober chirps securely

 Now for my friends and brethrens sakes
 And for my dearlovd Land o Cakes
 I pray with holy fire
 Lord send a roughshod troop o Hell
 Oer a wad Scotland buy or sell
 To grind them in the mire




Elegy On Captain Matthew Henderson

A Gentleman who held the Patent for his Honours immediately from
Almighty God

 Should the poor be flatteredShakespeare


 O Death thou tyrant fell and bloody
 The meikle devil wi a woodie
 Haurl thee hame to his black smiddie
 Oer hurcheon hides
 And like stockfish come oer his studdie
 Wi thy auld sides

 Hes gane hes gane hes frae us torn
 The ae best fellow eer was born
 Thee Matthew Natures sel shall mourn
 By wood and wild
 Where haply Pity strays forlorn
 Frae man exild

 Ye hills near neighbours o the starns
 That proudly cock your cresting cairns
 Ye cliffs the haunts of sailing earns
 Where Echo slumbers
 Come join ye Natures sturdiest bairns
 My wailing numbers

 Mourn ilka grove the cushat kens
 Ye hazly shaws and briery dens
 Ye burnies wimplin down your glens
 Wi toddlin din
 Or foaming strang wi hasty stens
 Frae lin to lin

 Mourn little harebells oer the lea
 Ye stately foxgloves fair to see
 Ye woodbines hanging bonilie
 In scented bowrs
 Ye roses on your thorny tree
 The first o flowrs

 At dawn when evry grassy blade
 Droops with a diamond at his head
 At evn when beans their fragrance shed
 I th rustling gale
 Ye maukins whiddin thro the glade
 Come join my wail

 Mourn ye wee songsters o the wood
 Ye grouse that crap the heather bud
 Ye curlews calling thro a clud
 Ye whistling plover
 And mourn we whirring paitrick brood
 Hes gane for ever

 Mourn sooty coots and speckled teals
 Ye fisher herons watching eels
 Ye duck and drake wi airy wheels
 Circling the lake
 Ye bitterns till the quagmire reels
 Rair for his sake

 Mourn clamring craiks at close o day
 Mang fields o flowring clover gay
 And when ye wing your annual way
 Frae our claud shore
 Tell thae far warlds wha lies in clay
 Wham we deplore

 Ye houlets frae your ivy bowr
 In some auld tree or eldritch towr
 What time the moon wi silent glowr
 Sets up her horn
 Wail thro the dreary midnight hour
 Till waukrife morn

 O rivers forests hills and plains
 Oft have ye heard my canty strains
 But now what else for me remains
 But tales of woe
 And frae my een the drapping rains
 Maun ever flow

 Mourn Spring thou darling of the year
 Ilk cowslip cup shall kep a tear
 Thou Simmer while each corny spear
 Shoots up its head
 Thy gay green flowry tresses shear
 For him thats dead

 Thou Autumn wi thy yellow hair
 In grief thy sallow mantle tear
 Thou Winter hurling thro the air
 The roaring blast
 Wide oer the naked world declare
 The worth weve lost

 Mourn him thou Sun great source of light
 Mourn Empress of the silent night
 And you ye twinkling starnies bright
 My Matthew mourn
 For through your orbs hes taen his flight
 Neer to return

 O Henderson the man the brother
 And art thou gone and gone for ever
 And hast thou crost that unknown river
 Lifes dreary bound
 Like thee where shall I find another
 The world around

 Go to your sculpturd tombs ye Great
 In a the tinsel trash o state
 But by thy honest turf Ill wait
 Thou man of worth
 And weep the ae best fellows fate
 Eer lay in earth




The Epitaph

 Stop passenger my storys brief
 And truth I shall relate man
 I tell nae common tale o grief
 For Matthew was a great man

 If thou uncommon merit hast
 Yet spurnd at Fortunes door man
 A look of pity hither cast
 For Matthew was a poor man

 If thou a noble sodger art
 That passest by this grave man
 There moulders here a gallant heart
 For Matthew was a brave man

 If thou on men their works and ways
 Canst throw uncommon light man
 Here lies wha weel had won thy praise
 For Matthew was a bright man

 If thou at Friendships sacred ca
 Wad life itself resign man
 Thy sympathetic tear maun fa
 For Matthew was a kind man

 If thou art staunch without a stain
 Like the unchanging blue man
 This was a kinsman o thy ain
 For Matthew was a true man

 If thou hast wit and fun and fire
 And neer guid wine did fear man
 This was thy billie dam and sire
 For Matthew was a queer man

 If ony whiggish whingin sot
 To blame poor Matthew dare man
 May dool and sorrow be his lot
 For Matthew was a rare man

 But now his radiant course is run
 For Matthews was a bright one
 His soul was like the glorious sun
 A matchless Heavenly light man

Tam O Shanter

 A Tale

 Of Brownyis and of Bogillis full is this Buke

 Gawin Douglas


 When chapman billies leave the street
 And drouthy neibors neibors meet
 As market days are wearing late
 And folk begin to tak the gate
 While we sit bousing at the nappy
 An getting fou and unco happy
 We think na on the lang Scots miles
 The mosses waters slaps and stiles
 That lie between us and our hame
 Where sits our sulky sullen dame
 Gathering her brows like gathering storm
 Nursing her wrath to keep it warm

 This truth fand honest Tam o Shanter
 As he frae Ayr ae night did canter
 Auld Ayr wham neer a town surpasses
 For honest men and bonie lasses

 O Tam hadst thou but been sae wise
 As taen thy ain wife Kates advice
 She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum
 A blethering blustering drunken blellum
 That frae November till October
 Ae marketday thou was na sober
 That ilka melder wi the Miller
 Thou sat as lang as thou had siller
 That evry naig was cad a shoe on
 The Smith and thee gat roarin fou on
 That at the Lords house evn on Sunday
 Thou drank wi Kirkton Jean till Monday
 She prophesied that late or soon
 Thou wad be found deep drownd in Doon
 Or catchd wi warlocks in the mirk
 By Alloways auld haunted kirk

 Ah gentle dames it gars me greet
 To think how mony counsels sweet
 How mony lengthend sage advices
 The husband frae the wife despises

 But to our tale Ae market night
 Tam had got planted unco right
 Fast by an ingle bleezing finely
 Wi reaming saats that drank divinely
 And at his elbow Souter Johnie
 His ancient trusty drougthy crony
 Tam loed him like a very brither
 They had been fou for weeks thegither
 The night drave on wi sangs an clatter
 And aye the ale was growing better
 The Landlady and Tam grew gracious
 Wi favours secret sweet and precious
 The Souter tauld his queerest stories
 The Landlords laugh was ready chorus
 The storm without might rair and rustle
 Tam did na mind the storm a whistle

 Care mad to see a man sae happy
 Een drownd himsel amang the nappy
 As bees flee hame wi lades o treasure
 The minutes wingd their way wi pleasure
 Kings may be blest but Tam was glorious
 Oer a the ills o life victorious

 But pleasures are like poppies spread
 You seize the flowr its bloom is shed
 Or like the snow falls in the river
 A moment whitethen melts for ever
 Or like the Borealis race
 That flit ere you can point their place
 Or like the Rainbows lovely form
 Evanishing amid the storm
 Nae man can tether Time nor Tide
 The hour approaches Tam maun ride
 That hour o nights black arch the keystane
 That dreary hour he mounts his beast in
 And sic a night he taks the road in
 As neer poor sinner was abroad in

 The wind blew as twad blawn its last
 The rattling showers rose on the blast
 The speedy gleams the darkness swallowd
 Loud deep and lang the thunder bellowd
 That night a child might understand
 The deil had business on his hand

 Weelmounted on his grey mare Meg
 A better never lifted leg
 Tam skelpit on thro dub and mire
 Despising wind and rain and fire
 Whiles holding fast his gude blue bonnet
 Whiles crooning oer some auld Scots sonnet
 Whiles glowrin round wi prudent cares
 Lest bogles catch him unawares
 KirkAlloway was drawing nigh
 Where ghaists and houlets nightly cry

 By this time he was cross the ford
 Where in the snaw the chapman smoord
 And past the birks and meikle stane
 Where drunken Charlie braks neckbane
 And thro the whins and by the cairn
 Where hunters fand the murderd bairn
 And near the thorn aboon the well
 Where Mungos mither hangd hersel
 Before him Doon pours all his floods
 The doubling storm roars thro the woods
 The lightnings flash from pole to pole
 Near and more near the thunders roll
 When glimmering thro the groaning trees
 KirkAlloway seemd in a bleeze
 Thro ilka bore the beams were glancing
 And loud resounded mirth and dancing

 Inspiring bold John Barleycorn
 What dangers thou canst make us scorn
 Wi tippenny we fear nae evil
 Wi usquabae well face the devil
 The swats sae reamd in Tammies noddle
 Fair play he card na deils a boddle
 But Maggie stood right sair astonishd
 Till by the heel and hand admonishd
 She venturd forward on the light
 And wow Tam saw an unco sight

 Warlocks and witches in a dance
 Nae cotillon brent new frae France
 But hornpipes jigs strathspeys and reels
 Put life and mettle in their heels
 A winnockbunker in the east
 There sat auld Nick in shape o beast
 A towzie tyke black grim and large
 To gie them music was his charge
 He screwd the pipes and gart them skirl
 Till roof and rafters a did dirl
 Coffins stood round like open presses
 That shawd the Dead in their last dresses
 And by some devilish cantraip sleight
 Each in its cauld hand held a light
 By which heroic Tam was able
 To note upon the haly table
 A murderers banes in gibbetairns
 Twa spanlang wee unchristened bairns
 A thief newcutted frae a rape
 Wi his last gasp his gabudid gape
 Five tomahawks wi blude redrusted
 Five scimitars wi murder crusted
 A garter which a babe had strangled
 A knife a fathers throat had mangled
 Whom his ain son of life bereft
 The greyhairs yet stack to the heft
 Wi mair of horrible and awfu
 Which even to name wad be unlawfu

 As Tammie glowrd amazd and curious
 The mirth and fun grew fast and furious
 The Piper loud and louder blew
 The dancers quick and quicker flew
 The reeld they set they crossd they cleekit
 Till ilka carlin swat and reekit
 And coost her duddies to the wark
 And linkit at it in her sark

 Now Tam O Tam had they been queans
 A plump and strapping in their teens
 Their sarks instead o creeshie flainen
 Been snawwhite seventeen hunder linen
 Thir breeks o mine my only pair
 That ance were plush o guid blue hair
 I wad hae gien them off my hurdies
 For ae blink o the bonie burdies
 But witherd beldams auld and droll
 Rigwoodie hags wad spean a foal
 Louping an flinging on a crummock
 I wonder did na turn thy stomach

 But Tam kent what was what fu brawlie
 There was ae winsome wench and waulie
 That night enlisted in the core
 Lang after kend on Carrick shore
 For mony a beast to dead she shot
 And perishd mony a bonie boat
 And shook baith meikle corn and bear
 And kept the countryside in fear
 Her cutty sark o Paisley harn
 That while a lassie she had worn
 In longitude tho sorely scanty
 It was her best and she was vauntie
 Ah little kend thy reverend grannie
 That sark she coft for her wee Nannie
 Wi twa pund Scots twas a her riches
 Wad ever gracd a dance of witches

 But here my Muse her wing maun cour
 Sic flights are far beyond her power
 To sing how Nannie lap and flang
 A souple jade she was and strang
 And how Tam stood like ane bewithcd
 And thought his very een enrichd
 Even Satan glowrd and fidgd fu fain
 And hotchd and blew wi might and main
 Till first ae caper syne anither
 Tam tint his reason a thegither
 And roars out Weel done Cuttysark
 And in an instant all was dark
 And scarcely had he Maggie rallied
 When out the hellish legion sallied

 As bees bizz out wi angry fyke
 When plundering herds assail their byke
 As open pussies mortal foes
 When pop she starts before their nose
 As eager runs the marketcrowd
 When Catch the thief resounds aloud
 So Maggie runs the witches follow
 Wi mony an eldritch skreich and hollow

 Ah Tam Ah Tam thoull get thy fairin
 In hell theyll roast thee like a herrin
 In vain thy Kate awaits thy comin
 Kate soon will be a woefu woman
 Now do thy speedyutmost Meg
 And win the keystone o the brig1
 There at them thou thy tail may toss
 A running stream they dare na cross
 But ere the keystane she could make
 The fient a tail she had to shake
 For Nannie far before the rest
 Hard upon noble Maggie prest
 And flew at Tam wi furious ettle
 But little wist she Maggies mettle
 Ae spring brought off her master hale
 But left behind her ain grey tail
 The carlin claught her by the rump
 And left poor Maggie scarce a stump

 Now wha this tale o truth shall read
 Ilk man and mothers son take heed
 Wheneer to Drink you are inclind
 Or Cuttysarks rin in your mind
 Think ye may buy the joys oer dear
 Remember Tam o Shanters mare




On The Birth Of A Posthumous Child

 Born in peculiar circumstances of family distress


 Sweet flowret pledge o meikle love
 And ward o mony a prayer
 What heart o stane wad thou na move
 Sae helpless sweet and fair

 November hirples oer the lea
 Chil on thy lovely form
 And gane alas the sheltring tree
 Should shield thee frae the storm

 Footnote 1 It is a wellknown fact that witches or any evil
 spirits have no power to follow a poor wight any further than
 the middle of the next running stream It may be proper likewise
 to mention to the benighted traveller that when he falls in with
 bogles whatever danger may be in his going forward there is
 much more hazard in turning backRB

 May He who gives the rain to pour
 And wings the blast to blaw
 Protect thee frae the driving showr
 The bitter frost and snaw

 May He the friend o Woe and Want
 Who heals lifes various stounds
 Protect and guard the mother plant
 And heal her cruel wounds

 But late she flourishd rooted fast
 Fair in the summer morn
 Now feebly bends she in the blast
 Unshelterd and forlorn

 Blest be thy bloom thou lovely gem
 Unscathd by ruffian hand
 And from thee many a parent stem
 Arise to deck our land




Elegy On The Late Miss Burnet Of Monboddo

 Life neer exulted in so rich a prize
 As Burnet lovely from her native skies
 Nor envious death so triumphd in a blow
 As that which laid th accomplishd Burnet low

 Thy form and mind sweet maid can I forget
 In richest ore the brightest jewel set
 In thee high Heaven above was truest shown
 As by His noblest work the Godhead best is known

 In vain ye flaunt in summers pride ye groves
 Thou crystal streamlet with thy flowery shore
 Ye woodland choir that chaunt your idle loves
 Ye cease to charm Eliza is no more

 Ye healthy wastes immixd with reedy fens
 Ye mossy streams with sedge and rushes stord
 Ye rugged cliffs oerhanging dreary glens
 To you I flyye with my soul accord

 Princes whose cumbrous pride was all their worth
 Shall venal lays their pompous exit hail
 And thou sweet Excellence forsake our earth
 And not a Muse with honest grief bewail

 We saw thee shine in youth and beautys pride
 And Virtues light that beams beyond the spheres
 But like the sun eclipsd at morning tide
 Thou left us darkling in a world of tears

 The parents heart that nestled fond in thee
 That heart how sunk a prey to grief and care
 So deckt the woodbine sweet yon aged tree
 So from it ravishd leaves it bleak and bare

Lament Of Mary Queen Of Scots On The Approach Of Spring

 Now Nature hangs her mantle green
 On every blooming tree
 And spreads her sheets o daisies white
 Out oer the grassy lea
 Now Phoebus cheers the crystal streams
 And glads the azure skies
 But nought can glad the weary wight
 That fast in durance lies

 Now laverocks wake the merry morn
 Aloft on dewy wing
 The merle in his noontide bowr
 Makes woodland echoes ring
 The mavis wild wi mony a note
 Sings drowsy day to rest
 In love and freedom they rejoice
 Wi care nor thrall opprest

 Now blooms the lily by the bank
 The primrose down the brae
 The hawthorns budding in the glen
 And milkwhite is the slae
 The meanest hind in fair Scotland
 May rove their sweets amang
 But I the Queen of a Scotland
 Maun lie in prison strang

 I was the Queen o bonie France
 Where happy I hae been
 Fu lightly raise I in the morn
 As blythe lay down at een
 And Im the sovreign of Scotland
 And mony a traitor there
 Yet here I lie in foreign bands
 And neverending care

 But as for thee thou false woman
 My sister and my fae
 Grim Vengeance yet shall whet a sword
 That thro thy soul shall gae
 The weeping blood in womans breast
 Was never known to thee
 Nor th balm that draps on wounds of woe
 Frae womans pitying ee

 My son my son may kinder stars
 Upon thy fortune shine
 And may those pleasures gild thy reign
 That neer wad blink on mine
 God keep thee frae thy mothers faes
 Or turn their hearts to thee
 And where thou meetst thy mothers friend
 Remember him for me

 O soon to me may Summer suns
 Nae mair light up the morn
 Nae mair to me the Autumn winds
 Wave oer the yellow corn
 And in the narrow house of death
 Let Winter round me rave
 And the next flowrs that deck the Spring
 Bloom on my peaceful grave




Therell Never Be Peace Till Jamie Comes Hame

 By yon Castle wa at the close of the day
 I heard a man sing tho his head it was grey
 And as he was singing the tears doon came
 Therell never be peace till Jamie comes hame

 The Church is in ruins the State is in jars
 Delusions oppressions and murderous wars
 We dare na weel sayt but we ken whas to blame
 Therell never be peace till Jamie comes hame

 My seven braw sons for Jamie drew sword
 But now I greet round their green beds in the yerd
 It brak the sweet heart o my faithful and dame
 Therell never be peace till Jamie comes hame

 Now life is a burden that bows me down
 Sin I tint my bairns and he tint his crown
 But till my last moments my words are the same
 Therell never be peace till Jamie comes hame




SongOut Over The Forth

 Out over the Forth I look to the North
 But what is the north and its Highlands to me
 The south nor the east gie ease to my breast
 The far foreign land or the wide rolling sea

 But I look to the west when I gae to rest
 That happy my dreams and my slumbers may be
 For far in the west lives he I loe best
 The man that is dear to my babie and me




The Banks O DoonFirst Version

 Sweet are the banksthe banks o Doon
 The spreading flowers are fair
 And everything is blythe and glad
 But I am fu o care
 Thoull break my heart thou bonie bird
 That sings upon the bough
 Thou minds me o the happy days
 When my fause Luve was true
 Thoull break my heart thou bonie bird
 That sings beside thy mate
 For sae I sat and sae I sang
 And wist na o my fate

 Aft hae I rovd by bonie Doon
 To see the woodbine twine
 And ilka birds sang o its Luve
 And sae did I o mine
 Wi lightsome heart I pud a rose
 Upon its thorny tree
 But my fause Luver staw my rose
 And left the thorn wi me
 Wi lightsome heart I pud a rose
 Upon a morn in June
 And sae I flourished on the morn
 And sae was pud or noon




The Banks O DoonSecond Version

 Ye flowery banks o bonie Doon
 How can ye blume sae fair
 How can ye chant ye little birds
 And I sae fu o care
 Thoull break my heart thou bonie bird
 That sings upon the bough
 Thou minds me o the happy days
 When my fause Luve was true
 Thoull break my heart thou bonie bird
 That sings beside thy mate
 For sae I sat and sae I sang
 And wist na o my fate

 Aft hae I rovd by bonie Doon
 To see the woodbine twine
 And ilka bird sang o its Luve
 And sae did I o mine
 Wi lightsome heart I pud a rose
 Upon its thorny tree
 But my fause Luver staw my rose
 And left the thorn wi me
 Wi lightsome heart I pud a rose
 Upon a morn in June
 And sae I flourished on the morn
 And sae was pud or noon




The Banks O DoonThird Version

 Ye banks and braes o bonie Doon
 How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair
 How can ye chant ye little birds
 And I sae weary fu o care
 Thoull break my heart thou warbling bird
 That wantons thro the flowering thorn
 Thou minds me o departed joys
 Departed never to return

 Aft hae I rovd by Bonie Doon
 To see the rose and woodbine twine
 And ilka bird sang o its Luve
 And fondly sae did I o mine
 Wi lightsome heart I pud a rose
 Fu sweet upon its thorny tree
 And may fause Luver staw my rose
 But ah he left the thorn wi me




Lament For James Earl Of Glencairn

 The wind blew hollow frae the hills
 By fits the suns departing beam
 Lookd on the fading yellow woods
 That wavd oer Lugars winding stream
 Beneath a craigy steep a Bard
 Laden with years and meikle pain
 In loud lament bewaild his lord
 Whom Death had all untimely taen

 He leand him to an ancient aik
 Whose trunk was mouldring down with years
 His locks were bleached white with time
 His hoary cheek was wet wi tears
 And as he touchd his trembling harp
 And as he tund his doleful sang
 The winds lamenting thro their caves
 To Echo bore the notes alang

 Ye scatterd birds that faintly sing
 The reliques o the vernal queir
 Ye woods that shed on a the winds
 The honours of the aged year
 A few short months and glad and gay
 Again yell charm the ear and ee
 But nocht in allrevolving time
 Can gladness bring again to me

 I am a bending aged tree
 That long has stood the wind and rain
 But now has come a cruel blast
 And my last hald of earth is gane
 Nae leaf o mine shall greet the spring
 Nae simmer sun exalt my bloom
 But I maun lie before the storm
 And ithers plant them in my room

 Ive seen sae mony changefu years
 On earth I am a stranger grown
 I wander in the ways of men
 Alike unknowing and unknown
 Unheard unpitied unrelievd
 I bear alane my lade o care
 For silent low on beds of dust
 Lie a
 hat would my sorrows share

 And last the sum of a my griefs
 My noble master lies in clay
 The flowr amang our barons bold
 His countrys pride his countrys stay
 In weary being now I pine
 For a the life of life is dead
 And hope has left may aged ken
 On forward wing for ever fled

 Awake thy last sad voice my harp
 The voice of woe and wild despair
 Awake resound thy latest lay
 Then sleep in silence evermair
 And thou my last best only friend
 That fillest an untimely tomb
 Accept this tribute from the Bard
 Thou brought from Fortunes mirkest gloom

 In Povertys low barren vale
 Thick mists obscure involvd me round
 Though oft I turnd the wistful eye
 Nae ray of fame was to be found
 Thou foundst me like the morning sun
 That melts the fogs in limpid air
 The friendless bard and rustic song
 Became alike thy fostering care

 O why has worth so short a date
 While villains ripen grey with time
 Must thou the noble genrous great
 Fall in bold manhoods hardy prim
 Why did I live to see that day
 A day to me so full of woe
 O had I met the mortal shaft
 That laid my benefactor low

 The bridegroom may forget the bride
 Was made his wedded wife yestreen
 The monarch may forget the crown
 That on his head an hour has been
 The mother may forget the child
 That smiles sae sweetly on her knee
 But Ill remember thee Glencairn
 And a that thou hast done for me




Lines Sent To Sir John Whiteford Bart

 With The Lament On The Death Of the Earl Of Glencairn


 Thou who thy honour as thy God reverst
 Who save thy minds reproach nought earthly fearst
 To thee this votive offering I impart
 The tearful tribute of a broken heart
 The Friend thou valuedst I the Patron lovd
 His worth his honour all the world approved
 Well mourn till we too go as he has gone
 And tread the shadowy path to that dark world unknown




Craigieburn Wood

 Sweet closes the evning on Craigieburn Wood
 And blythely awaukens the morrow
 But the pride o the spring in the Craigieburn Wood
 Can yield to me nothing but sorrow

 ChorusBeyond thee dearie beyond thee dearie
 And O to be lying beyond thee
 O sweetly soundly weel may he sleep
 Thats laid in the bed beyond thee

 I see the spreading leaves and flowers
 I hear the wild birds singing
 But pleasure they hae nane for me
 While care my heart is wringing
 Beyond thee c

 I can na tell I maun na tell
 I daur na for your anger
 But secret love will break my heart
 If I conceal it langer

 If thou refuse thy Johnie
 Beyond thee c

 To see thee in anothers arms
 In love to lie and languish

 My heart wad burst wi anguish
 Beyond thee c

 But Jeanie say thou wilt be mine
 Say thou loes nane before me
 And a may days o life to come
 Il gratefully adore thee

 The Bonie Wee Thing

 ChorusBonie wee thing cannie wee thing
 Lovely wee thing wert thou mine
 I wad wear thee in my bosom
 Lest my jewel it should tine

 Wishfully I look and languish
 In that bonie face o thine
 And my heart it stounds wi anguish
 Lest my wee thing be na mine
 Bonie wee thing c

 Wit and Grace and Love and Beauty
 In ae constellation shine
 To adore thee is my duty
 Goddess o this soul o mine
 Bonie wee thing c




Epigram On Miss Davies

On being asked why she had been formed so little and Mrs Aso big


 Ask why God made the gem so small
 And why so huge the granite
 Because God meant mankind should set
 That higher value on it




The Charms Of Lovely Davies

 TuneMiss Muir


 O how shall I unskilfu try
 The poets occupation
 The tunefu powers in happy hours
 That whisper inspiration
 Even they maun dare an effort mair
 Than aught they ever gave us
 Ere they rehearse in equal verse
 The charms o lovely Davies

 Each eye it cheers when she appears
 Like Phoebus in the morning
 When past the shower and every flower
 The garden is adorning
 As the wretch looks oer Siberias shore
 When winterbound the wave is
 Sae droops our heart when we maun part
 Frae charming lovely Davies

 Her smiles a gift frae boon the lift
 That maks us mair than princes
 A sceptred hand a kings command
 Is in her darting glances
 The man in arms gainst female charms
 Even he her willing slave is
 He hugs his chain and owns the reign
 Of conquering lovely Davies

 My Muse to dream of such a theme
 Her feeble powers surrender
 The eagles gaze alone surveys
 The suns meridian splendour
 I wad in vain essay the strain
 The deed too daring brave is
 Ill drap the lyre and mute admire
 The charms o lovely Davies

The Posie

 O luve will venture in where it daur na weel be seen
 O luve will venture in where wisdom ance has been
 But I will doun yon river rove amang the wood sae green
 And a to pu a Posie to my ain dear May

 The primrose I will pu the firstling o the year
 And I will pu the pink the emblem o my dear
 For shes the pink o womankind and blooms without a peer
 And a to be a Posie to my ain dear May

 Ill pu the budding rose when Phoebus peeps in view
 For its like a baumy kiss o her sweet bonie mou
 The hyacinths for constancy wi its unchanging blue
 And a to be a Posie to my ain dear May

 The lily it is pure and the lily it is fair
 And in her lovely bosom Ill place the lily there
 The daisys for simplicity and unaffected air
 And a to be a Posie to my ain dear May

 The hawthorn I will pu wi its locks o siller gray
 Where like an aged man it stands at break o day
 But the songsters nest within the bush I winna tak away
 And a to be a Posie to my ain dear May

 The woodbine I will pu when the eening star is near
 And the diamond draps o dew shall be her een sae clear
 The violets for modesty which weel she fas to wear
 And a to be a Posie to my ain dear May

 Ill tie the Posie round wi the silken band o luve
 And Ill place it in her breast and Ill swear by a above
 That to my latest draught o life the band shall neer remove
 And this will be a Posie to my ain dear May




On Glenriddells Fox Breaking His Chain

 A Fragment 1791


 Thou Liberty thou art my theme
 Not such as idle poets dream
 Who trick thee up a heathen goddess
 That a fantastic cap and rod has
 Such stale conceits are poor and silly
 I paint thee out a Highland filly
 A sturdy stubborn handsome dapple
 As sleeks a mouse as rounds an apple
 That when thou pleasest canst do wonders
 But when thy luckless rider blunders
 Or if thy fancy should demur there
 Wilt break thy neck ere thou go further

 These things premised I sing a Fox
 Was caught among his native rocks
 And to a dirty kennel chained
 How he his liberty regained

 Glenriddell Whig without a stain
 A Whig in principle and grain
 Couldst thou enslave a freeborn creature
 A native denizen of Nature
 How couldst thou with a heart so good
 A better neer was sluiced with blood
 Nail a poor devil to a tree
 That neer did harm to thine or thee

 The staunchest Whig Glenriddell was
 Quite frantic in his countrys cause
 And oft was Reynards prison passing
 And with his brotherWhigs canvassing
 The Rights of Men the Powers of Women
 With all the dignity of Freemen

 Sir Reynard daily heard debates
 Of Princes Kings and Nations fates
 With many rueful bloody stories
 Of Tyrants Jacobites and Tories
 From liberty how angels fell
 That now are galleyslaves in hell
 How Nimrod first the trade began
 Of binding Slaverys chains on Man
 How fell SemiramisGod damn her
 Did first with sacrilegious hammer
 All ills till then were trivial matters
 For Man dethrond forge henpeck fetters

 How Xerxes that abandoned Tory
 Thought cutting throats was reaping glory
 Until the stubborn Whigs of Sparta
 Taught him great Natures Magna Charta
 How mighty Rome her fiat hurld
 Resistless oer a bowing world
 And kinder than they did desire
 Polishd mankind with sword and fire
 With much too tedious to relate
 Of ancient and of modern date
 But ending still how Billy Pitt
 Unlucky boy with wicked wit
 Has gaggd old Britain draind her coffer
 As butchers bind and bleed a heifer

 Thus wily Reynard by degrees
 In kennel listening at his ease
 Suckd in a mighty stock of knowledge
 As much as some folks at a College
 Knew Britains rights and constitution
 Her aggrandisement diminution
 How fortune wrought us good from evil
 Let no man then despise the Devil
 As who should say I never can need him
 Since we to scoundrels owe our freedom




Poem On Pastoral Poetry

 Hail Poesie thou Nymph reservd
 In chase o thee what crowds hae swervd
 Frae common sense or sunk enervd
 Mang heaps o clavers
 And och oer aft thy joes hae starvd
 Mid a thy favours

 Say Lassie why thy train amang
 While loud the trumps heroic clang
 And sock or buskin skelp alang
 To death or marriage
 Scarce ane has tried the shepherdsang
 But wi miscarriage

 In Homers craft Jock Milton thrives
 Eschylus pen Will Shakespeare drives
 Wee Pope the knurlin till him rives
 Horatian fame
 In thy sweet sang Barbauld survives
 Even Sapphos flame

 But thee Theocritus wha matches
 Theyre no herds ballats Maros catches
 Squire Pope but busks his skinklin patches
 O heathen tatters
 I pass by hunders nameless wretches
 That ape their betters

 In this braw age o wit and lear
 Will nane the Shepherds whistle mair
 Blaw sweetly in its native air
 And rural grace
 And wi the farfamd Grecian share
 A rival place

 Yes there is anea Scottish callan
 Theres ane come forrit honest Allan
 Thou need na jouk behint the hallan
 A chiel sae clever
 The teeth o time may gnaw Tantallan
 But thous for ever

 Thou paints auld Nature to the nines
 In thy sweet Caledonian lines
 Nae gowden stream thro myrtle twines
 Where Philomel
 While nightly breezes sweep the vines
 Her griefs will tell

 In gowany glens thy burnie strays
 Where bonie lasses bleach their claes
 Or trots by hazelly shaws and braes
 Wi hawthorns gray
 Where blackbirds join the shepherds lays
 At close o day

 Thy rural loves are Natures sel
 Nae bombast spates o nonsense swell
 Nae snap conceits but that sweet spell
 O witchin love
 That charm that can the strongest quell
 The sternest move




Verses On The Destruction Of The Woods Near Drumlanrig

 As on the banks o wandering Nith
 Ae smiling simmer morn I strayd
 And traced its bonie howes and haughs
 Where linties sang and lammies playd
 I sat me down upon a craig
 And drank my fill o fancys dream
 When from the eddying deep below
 Up rose the genius of the stream

 Dark like the frowning rock his brow
 And troubled like his wintry wave
 And deep as sughs the boding wind
 Amang his caves the sigh he gave
 And come ye here my son he cried
 To wander in my birken shade
 To muse some favourite Scottish theme
 Or sing some favourite Scottish maid

 There was a time its nae lang syne
 Ye might hae seen me in my pride
 When a my banks sae bravely saw
 Their woody pictures in my tide
 When hanging beech and spreading elm
 Shaded my stream sae clear and cool
 And stately oaks their twisted arms
 Threw broad and dark across the pool

 When glinting thro the trees appeard
 The wee white cot aboon the mill
 And peacefu rose its ingle reek
 That slowly curling clamb the hill
 But now the cot is bare and cauld
 Its leafy bield for ever gane
 And scarce a stinted birk is left
 To shiver in the blast its lane

 Alas quoth I what ruefu chance
 Has twind ye o your stately trees
 Has laid your rocky bosom bare
 Has stripped the cleeding o your braes
 Was it the bitter eastern blast
 That scatters blight in early spring
 Or wast the wilfire scorchd their boughs
 Or cankerworm wi secret sting

 Nae eastlin blast the sprite replied
 It blaws na here sae fierce and fell
 And on my dry and halesome banks
 Nae cankerworms get leave to dwell
 Man cruel man the genius sighed
 As through the cliffs he sank him down
 The worm that gnawd my bonie trees
 That reptile wears a ducal crown1




The Gallant Weaver

 Where Cart rins rowin to the sea
 By mony a flower and spreading tree
 There lives a lad the lad for me
 He is a gallant Weaver
 O I had wooers aught or nine
 They gied me rings and ribbons fine
 And I was feard my heart wad tine
 And I gied it to the Weaver

 My daddie signd my tocherband
 To gie the lad that has the land
 But to my heart Ill add my hand
 And give it to the Weaver
 While birds rejoice in leafy bowers
 While bees delight in opening flowers
 While corn grows green in summer showers
 I love my gallant Weaver

 While Damons heart beat time Sir

My Tochers The Jewel

 O Meikle thinks my luve o my beauty
 And meikle thinks my luve o my kin

 Yell slip frae me like a knotless thread
 And yell crack your credit wi mae nor me

Thou Fair Eliza

 Turn again thou fair Eliza
 Ae kind blink before we part
 Rue on thy despairing lover
 Canst thou break his faithfu heart
 Turn again thou fair Eliza
 If to love thy heart denies
 Oh in pity hide the sentence
 Under friendships kind disguise

 Thee sweet maid hae I offended
 My offence is loving thee
 Canst thou wreck his peace for ever
 Wha for thine would gladly die
 While the life beats in my bosom
 Thou shalt mix in ilka throe
 Turn again thou lovely maiden
 Ae sweet smile on me bestow

 Not the bee upon the blossom
 In the pride o sinny noon
 Not the little sporting fairy
 All beneath the simmer moon
 Not the Minstrel in the moment
 Fancy lightens in his ee
 Kens the pleasure feels the rapture
 That thy presence gies to me




My Bonie Bell

 The smiling Spring comes in rejoicing
 And surly Winter grimly flies
 Now crystal clear are the falling waters
 And bonie blue are the sunny skies
 Fresh oer the mountains breaks forth the morning
 The evning gilds the oceans swell
 All creatures joy in the suns returning
 And I rejoice in my bonie Bell

 The flowery Spring leads sunny Summer
 The yellow Autumn presses near
 Then in his turn comes gloomy Winter
 Till smiling Spring again appear
 Thus seasons dancing life advancing
 Old Time and Nature their changes tell
 But never ranging still unchanging
 I adore my bonie Bell




Sweet Afton

 Flow gently sweet Afton amang thy green braes
 Flow gently Ill sing thee a song in thy praise
 My Marys asleep by thy murmuring stream
 Flow gently sweet Afton disturb not her dream

 Thou stockdove whose echo resounds thro the glen
 Ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den
 Thou greencrested lapwing thy screaming forbear
 I charge you disturb not my slumbering Fair

 How lofty sweet Afton thy neighbouring hills
 Far markd with the courses of clear winding rills
 There daily I wander as noon rises high
 My flocks and my Marys sweet cot in my eye

 How pleasant thy banks and green valleys below
 Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow
 There oft as mild Evning weeps over the lea
 The sweetscented birk shades my Mary and me

 Thy crystal stream Afton how lovely it glides
 And winds by the cot where my Mary resides
 How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave
 As gathering sweet flowerets she stems thy clear wave

 Flow gently sweet Afton amang thy green braes
 Flow gently sweet river the theme of my lays
 My Marys asleep by thy murmuring stream
 Flow gently sweet Afton disturb not her dream




Address To The Shade Of Thomson

On Crowning His Bust at Ednam Roxburghshire with a Wreath of Bays


 While virgin Spring by Edens flood
 Unfolds her tender mantle green
 Or pranks the sod in frolic mood
 Or tunes Eolian strains between

 While Summer with a matron grace
 Retreats to Dryburghs cooling shade
 Yet oft delighted stops to trace
 The progress of the spiky blade

 While Autumn benefactor kind
 By Tweed erects his aged head
 And sees with selfapproving mind
 Each creature on his bounty fed

 While maniac Winter rages oer
 The hills whence classic Yarrow flows
 Rousing the turbid torrents roar
 Or sweeping wild a waste of snows

 So long sweet Poet of the year
 Shall bloom that wreath thou well hast won
 While Scotia with exulting tear
 Proclaims that Thomson was her son




Nithsdales Welcome Hame

 The noble Maxwells and their powers
 Are coming oer the border
 And theyll gae big Terreagles towers
 And set them a in order
 And they declare Terreagles fair
 For their abode they choose it
 Theres no a heart in a the land
 Buts lighter at the news ot

 Tho stars in skies may disappear
 And angry tempests gather
 The happy hour may soon be near
 That brings us pleasant weather
 The weary night o care and grief
 May hae a joyfu morrow
 so dawning day has brought relief
 Fareweel our night o sorrow

 Frae the friends and land I love
 Drivn by Fortunes felly spite
 Frae my best belovd I rove
 Never mair to taste delight
 Never mair maun hope to find
 Ease frae toil relief frae care
 When Remembrance wracks the mind
 Pleasures but unveil despair

 Brightest climes shall mirk appear
 Desert ilka blooming shore
 Till the Fates nae mair severe
 Friendship love and peace restore
 Till Revenge wi laureld head
 Bring our banished hame again
 And ilk loyal bonie lad
 Cross the seas and win his ain




Such A Parcel Of Rogues In A Nation

 Fareweel to a our Scottish fame
 Fareweel our ancient glory
 Fareweel evn to the Scottish name
 Sae famd in martial story
 Now Sark rins over Solway sands
 An Tweed rins to the ocean
 To mark where Englands province stands
 Such a parcel of rogues in a nation

 What force or guile could not subdue
 Thro many warlike ages
 Is wrought now by a coward few
 For hireling traitors wages
 The English stell we could disdain
 Secure in valours station
 But English gold has been our bane
 Such a parcel of rogues in a nation

 O would or I had seen the day
 That Treason thus could sell us
 My auld grey head had lien in clay
 Wi Bruce and loyal Wallace
 But pith and power till my last hour
 Ill mak this declaration
 Were bought and sold for English gold
 Such a parcel of rogues in a nation




Ye Jacobites By Name

 Ye Jacobites by name give an ear give an ear
 Ye Jacobites by name give an ear
 Ye Jacobites by name
 Your fautes I will proclaim
 Your doctrines I maun blame you shall hear

 What is Right and What is Wrang by the law by the law
 What is Right and what is Wrang by the law
 What is Right and what is Wrang
 A short sword and a lang
 A weak arm and a strang for to draw

 What makes heroic strife famed afar famed afar
 What makes heroic strife famed afar
 What makes heroic strife
 To whet th assassins knife
 Or hunt a Parents life wi bluidy war

 Then let your schemes alone in the state in the state
 Then let your schemes alone in the state
 Then let your schemes alone
 Adore the rising sun
 And leave a man undone to his fate

 And loud the laugh gied round a hell

Epistle To John Maxwell ESQ Of Terraughty

 On His Birthday


 Health to the Maxwells veteran Chief
 Health aye unsourd by care or grief
 Inspird I turnd Fates sibyl leaf
 This natal morn
 I see thy life is stuff o prief
 Scarce quite halfworn

 This day thou metes threescore eleven
 And I can tell that bounteous Heaven
 The secondsight ye ken is given
 To ilka Poet
 On thee a tack o seven times seven
 Will yet bestow it

 If envious buckies view wi sorrow
 Thy lengthend days on this blest morrow
 May Desolations langteethd harrow
 Nine miles an hour
 Rake them like Sodom and Gomorrah
 In brunstane stour

 But for thy friends and they are mony
 Baith honest men and lassies bonie
 May couthie Fortune kind and cannie
 In social glee
 Wi mornings blythe and eenings funny
 Bless them and thee

 Fareweel auld birkie Lord be near ye
 And then the deil he daurna steer ye
 Your friends aye love your faes aye fear ye
 For me shame fa me
 If neist my heart I dinna wear ye
 While Burns they ca me




Second Epistle To Robert Graham ESQ Of Fintry

 5th October 1791


 Late crippld of an arm and now a leg
 About to beg a pass for leave to beg
 Dull listless teasd dejected and deprest
 Nature is adverse to a cripples rest
 Will generous Graham list to his Poets wail
 It soothes poor Misery hearkening to her tale
 And hear him curse the light he first surveyd
 And doubly curse the luckless rhyming trade

 Thou Nature partial Nature I arraign
 Of thy caprice maternal I complain
 The lion and the bull thy care have found
 One shakes the forests and one spurns the ground
 Thou givst the ass his hide the snail his shell
 Th envenomd wasp victorious guards his cell
 Thy minions kings defend control devour
 In all th omnipotence of rule and power
 Foxes and statesmen subtile wiles ensure
 The cit and polecat stink and are secure
 Toads with their poison doctors with their drug
 The priest and hedgehog in their robes are snug
 Evn silly woman has her warlike arts
 Her tongue and eyesher dreaded spear and darts

 But Oh thou bitter stepmother and hard
 To thy poor fenceless naked childthe Bard
 A thing unteachable in worlds skill
 And half an idiot too more helpless still
 No heels to bear him from the opning dun
 No claws to dig his hated sight to shun
 No horns but those by luckless Hymen worn
 And those alas not Amaltheas horn
 No nerves olfactry Mammons trusty cur
 Clad in rich Dulness comfortable fur
 In naked feeling and in aching pride
 He bears th unbroken blast from evry side
 Vampyre booksellers drain him to the heart
 And scorpion critics cureless venom dart

 Criticsappalld I venture on the name
 Those cutthroat bandits in the paths of fame
 Bloody dissectors worse than ten Monroes
 He hacks to teach they mangle to expose

 His heart by causeless wanton malice wrung
 By blockheads daring into madness stung
 His wellwon bays than life itself more dear
 By miscreants torn who neer one sprig must wear
 Foild bleeding torturd in th unequal strife
 The hapless Poet flounders on thro life
 Till fled each hope that once his bosom fird
 And fled each muse that glorious once inspird
 Low sunk in squalid unprotected age
 Dead even resentment for his injurd page
 He heeds or feels no more the ruthless critics rage

 So by some hedge the genrous steed deceasd
 For halfstarvd snarling curs a dainty feast
 By toil and famine wore to skin and bone
 Lies senseless of each tugging bitchs son

 O Dulness portion of the truly blest
 Calm shelterd haven of eternal rest
 Thy sons neer madden in the fierce extremes
 Of Fortunes polar frost or torrid beams
 If mantling high she fills the golden cup
 With sober selfish ease they sip it up
 Conscious the bounteous meed they well deserve
 They only wonder some folks do not starve
 The grave sage hern thus easy picks his frog
 And thinks the mallard a sad worthless dog
 When disappointments snaps the clue of hope
 And thro disastrous night they darkling grope
 With deaf endurance sluggishly they bear
 And just conclude that fools are fortunes care
 So heavy passive to the tempests shocks
 Strong on the signpost stands the stupid ox

 Not so the idle Muses madcap train
 Not such the workings of their moonstruck brain
 In equanimity they never dwell
 By turns in soaring heavn or vaulted hell

 I dread thee Fate relentless and severe
 With all a poets husbands fathers fear
 Already one strong hold of hope is lost
 Glencairn the truly noble lies in dust
 Fled like the sun eclipsd as noon appears
 And left us darkling in a world of tears
 O hear my ardent grateful selfish prayr
 Fintry my other stay long bless and spare
 Thro a long life his hopes and wishes crown
 And bright in cloudless skies his sun go down
 May bliss domestic smooth his private path
 Give energy to life and soothe his latest breath
 With many a filial tear circling the bed of death




The Song Of Death

 TuneOran an aoig

 SceneA Field of Battle Time of the dayevening The wounded
 and dying of the victorious army are supposed to join in the
 following song


 Farewell thou fair day thou green earth and ye skies
 Now gay with the broad setting sun
 Farewell loves and friendships ye dear tender ties
 Our race of existence is run
 Thou grim King of Terrors thou Lifes gloomy foe
 Go frighten the coward and slave
 Go teach them to tremble fell tyrant but know
 No terrors hast thou to the brave

 Thou strikst the dull peasanthe sinks in the dark
 Nor saves een the wreck of a name
 Thou strikst the young heroa glorious mark
 He falls in the blaze of his fame
 In the field of proud honourour swords in our hands
 Our King and our country to save
 While victory shines on Lifes last ebbing sands
 O who would not die with the brave




Poem On Sensibility

 Sensibility how charming
 Dearest Nancy thou canst tell
 But distress with horrors arming
 Thou alas hast known too well

 Fairest flower behold the lily
 Blooming in the sunny ray
 Let the blast sweep oer the valley
 See it prostrate in the clay

 Hear the wood lark charm the forest
 Telling oer his little joys
 But alas a prey the surest
 To each pirate of the skies

 Dearly bought the hidden treasure
 Finer feelings can bestow
 Chords that vibrate sweetest pleasure
 Thrill the deepest notes of woe




The Toadeater

 Of Lordly acquaintance you boast
 And the Dukes that you dined wi yestreen
 Yet an insects an insect at most
 Tho it crawl on the curl of a Queen




Divine Service In The Kirk Of Lamington

 As cauld a wind as ever blew

 And we desire no more Amen

 And heres to them that wish us weel
 May a thats guid watch oer em
 And heres to them we dare na tell

Ae Fond Kiss And Then We Sever

 TuneRory Dalls Port


 Ae fond kiss and then we sever
 Ae fareweel alas for ever
 Deep in heartwrung tears Ill pledge thee
 Warring sighs and groans Ill wage thee
 Who shall say that Fortune grieves him
 While the star of hope she leaves him
 Me nae cheerful twinkle lights me
 Dark despair around benights me

 Ill neer blame my partial fancy
 Naething could resist my Nancy
 But to see her was to love her
 Love but her and love for ever
 Had we never lovd sae kindly
 Had we never lovd sae blindly
 Never metor never parted
 We had neer been brokenhearted

 Faretheeweel thou first and fairest
 Faretheeweel thou best and dearest
 Thine be ilka joy and treasure
 Peace Enjoyment Love and Pleasure
 Ae fond kiss and then we sever
 Ae fareweeli alas for ever
 Deep in heartwrung tears Ill pledge thee
 Warring sighs and groans Ill wage thee




Behold The Hour The Boat Arrive

 Behold the hour the boat arrive
 My dearest Nancy O fareweel
 Severed frae thee can I survive
 Frae thee whom I hae lovd sae weel

 Endless and deep shall be my grief
 LNae ray of comfort shall I see
 But this most precious dear belief
 That thou wilt still remember me

 Alang the solitary shore
 Where flitting seafowl round me cry
 Across the rolling dashing roar
 Ill westward turn my wishful eye

 Happy thou Indian grove Ill say
 Where now my Nancys path shall be
 While thro your sweets she holds her way
 O tell me does she muse on me




Thou Gloomy December

 Ance mair I hail thee thou gloomy December
 Ance mair I hail thee wi sorrow and care
 Sad was the parting thou makes me remember
 Parting wi Nancy oh neer to meet mair

 Fond lovers parting is sweet painful pleasure
 Hope beaming mild on the soft parting hour
 But the dire feeling O farewell for ever
 Is anguish unmingled and agony pure

 Wild as the winter now tearing the forest
 Till the last leaf o the summer is flown
 Such is the tempest has shaken my bosom
 Till my last hope and last comfort is gone

 Still as I hail thee thou gloomy December
 Still shall I hail thee wi sorrow and care
 For sad was the parting thou makes me remember
 Parting wi Nancy oh neer to meet mair




My Native Land Sae Far Awa

 O sad and heavy should I part
 But for her sake sae far awa
 Unknowing what my way may thwart
 My native land sae far awa

 Thou that of a things Maker art
 That formed this Fair sae far awa
 Gie body strength then Ill neer start
 At this my way sae far awa

 How true is love to pure desert
 Like mine for her sae far awa
 And nocht can heal my bosoms smart
 While oh she is sae far awa

 Nane other love nane other dart
 I feel but hers sae far awa
 But fairer never touchd a heart
 Than hers the Fair sae far awa

I do Confess Thou Art Sae Fair

 Alteration of an Old Poem


 I Do confess thou art sae fair
 I was been oer the lugs in luve
 Had I na found the slightest prayer
 That lips could speak thy heart could muve

 I do confess thee sweet but find
 Thou art so thriftless o thy sweets
 Thy favours are the silly wind
 That kisses ilka thing it meets

 See yonder rosebud rich in dew
 Amang its native briers sae coy
 How sune it tines its scent and hue
 When pud and worn a common toy

 Sic fate ere lang shall thee betide
 Tho thou may gaily bloom awhile
 And sune thou shalt be thrown aside
 Like ony common weed and vile




Lines On Fergusson The Poet

 Illfated genius Heaventaught Fergusson
 What heart that feels and will not yield a tear
 To think Lifes sun did set eer well begun
 To shed its influence on thy bright career

 O why should truest Worth and Genius pine
 Beneath the iron grasp of Want and Woe
 While titled knaves and idiotGreatness shine
 In all the splendour Fortune can bestow




The Weary Pund O Tow

 ChorusThe weary pund the weary pund
 The weary pund o tow
 I think my wife will end her life
 Before she spin her tow

 I bought my wife a stane o lint
 As gude as eer did grow
 And a that she has made o that
 Is ae puir pund o tow
 The weary pund c

 There sat a bottle in a bole
 Beyont the ingle low
 And aye she took the tither souk
 To drouk the stourie tow
 The weary pund c

 Quoth I For shame ye dirty dame
 Gae spin your tap o tow
 She took the rock and wi a knock
 She brak it oer my pow
 The weary pund c

 At last her feetI sang to seet
 Gaed foremost oer the knowe
 And or I wad anither jad
 Ill wallop in a tow
 The weary pund c

Sic A Wife As Willie Had

 Willie Wastle dwalt on Tweed
 The spot they cad it Linkumdoddie
 Willie was a wabster gude
 Could stown a clue wi ony body
 He had a wife was dour and din
 O Tinkler Maidgie was her mither
 Sic a wife as Willie had
 I wad na gie a button for her

 She has an ee she has but ane
 The cat has twa the very colour
 Five rusty teeth forbye a stump
 A clapper tongue wad deave a miller
 A whiskin beard about her mou
 Her nose and chin they threaten ither
 Sic a wife as Willie had
 I wadna gie a button for her

 Shes bowhoughd shes heinshind
 Ae limpin leg a handbreed shorter
 Shes twisted right shes twisted left
 To balance fair in ilka quarter
 She has a lump upon her breast
 The twin o that upon her shouther
 Sic a wife as Willie had
 I wadna gie a button for her

 Auld baudrons by the ingle sits
 An wi her loof her face awashin
 But Willies wife is nae sae trig
 She dights her grunzie wi a hushion
 Her walie nieves like middencreels
 Her face wad fyle the Logan Water
 Sic a wife as Willie had
 I wadna gie a button for her




Lady Mary Ann

 O lady Mary Ann looks oer the Castle wa
 She saw three bonie boys playing at the ba
 The youngest he was the flower amang them a
 My bonie laddies young but hes growin yet

 O father O father an ye think it fit
 Well send him a year to the college yet
 Well sew a green ribbon round about his hat
 And that will let them ken hes to marry yet

 Lady Mary Ann was a flower in the dew
 Sweet was its smell and bonie was its hue
 And the longer it blossomd the sweeter it grew
 For the lily in the bud will be bonier yet

 Young Charlie Cochran was the sprout of an aik
 Bonie and bloomin and straught was its make
 The sun took delight to shine for its sake
 And it will be the brag o the forest yet

 The simmer is gane when the leaves they were green
 And the days are awa that we hae seen
 But far better days I trust will come again
 For my bonie laddies young but hes growin yet




Kellyburn Braes

 There lived a carl in Kellyburn Braes
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 And he had a wife was the plague of his days
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 Ae day as the carl gaed up the lang glen
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 He met with the Devil says How do you fen
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 Ive got a bad wife sir thats a my complaint
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 For savin your presence to her yere a saint
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 Its neither your stot nor your staig I shall crave
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 But gie me your wife man for her I must have
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 O welcome most kindly the blythe carl said
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 But if ye can match her yere waur than yere cad
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 The Devil has got the auld wife on his back
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 And like a poor pedlar hes carried his pack
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 Hes carried her hame to his ain hallan door
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 Syne bade her gae in for a bitch and a whore
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 Then straight he makes fifty the pick o his band
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 Turn out on her guard in the clap o a hand
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 The carlin gaed thro them like ony wud bear
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 Whaeer she gat hands on cam near her nae mair
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 A reekit wee deevil looks over the wa
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 O help maister help or shell ruin us a
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 The Devil he swore by the edge o his knife
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 He pitied the man that was tied to a wife
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 The Devil he swore by the kirk and the bell
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 He was not in wedlock thank Heavn but in hell
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 Then Satan has travelld again wi his pack
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 And to her auld husband hes carried her back
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime

 I hae been a Devil the feck o my life
 Hey and the rue grows bonie wi thyme
 But neer was in hell till I met wi a wife
 And the thyme it is witherd and rue is in prime




The Slaves Lament

 It was in sweet Senegal that my foes did me enthral
 For the lands of Virginiaginia O
 Torn from that lovely shore and must never see it more
 And alas I am weary weary O
 Torn from that lovely shore and must never see it more
 And alas I am weary weary O

 All on that charming coast is no bitter snow and frost
 Like the lands of Virginiaginia O
 There streams for ever flow and there flowers for ever blow
 And alas I am weary weary O
 There streams for ever flow and there flowers for ever blow
 And alas I am weary weary O

 The burden I must bear while the cruel scourge I fear
 In the lands of Virginiaginia O
 And I think on friends most dear with the bitter bitter tear
 And alas I am weary weary O
 And I think on friends most dear with the bitter bitter tear
 And alas I am weary weary O

 And corn wavd green in ilka field
 While claver blooms white oer the lea
 And roses blaw in ilka beild
 Blythe Bessie in the milking shiel

 An wilfu folk maun hae their will

 And gear will buy me sheep and kye

 Light is the burden love lays on
 Content and love brings peace and joy
 What mair hae Queens upon a throne




Bessy And Her Spinnin Wheel

 O Leeze me on my spinnin wheel
 And leeze me on my rock and reel
 Frae tap to tae that cleeds me bien
 And haps me biel and warm at een
 Ill set me down and sing and spin
 While laigh descends the simmer sun
 Blest wi content and milk and meal
 O leeze me on my spinnin wheel

 On ilka hand the burnies trot
 And meet below my theekit cot
 The scented birk and hawthorn white
 Across the pool their arms unite
 Alike to screen the birdies nest
 And little fishes caller rest
 The sun blinks kindly in the beil
 Where blythe I turn my spinnin wheel

 On lofty aiks the cushats wail
 And Echo cons the doolfu tale
 The lintwhites in the hazel braes
 Delighted rival ithers lays
 The craik amang the claver hay
 The pairtrick whirring oer the ley
 The swallow jinkin round my shiel
 Amuse me at my spinnin wheel

 Wi sma to sell and less to buy
 Aboon distress below envy
 O wha wad leave this humble state
 For a the pride of a the great
 Amid their flairing idle toys
 Amid their cumbrous dinsome joys
 Can they the peace and pleasure feel
 Of Bessy at her spinnin wheel




Love For Love

 Ithers seek they ken na what

 Gie me love in her I court
 Love to love maks a the sport

 Let love sparkle in her ee
 Let her loe nae man but me
 Thats the tochergude I prize
 There the luvers treasure lies




Saw Ye Bonie Lesley

 O saw ye bonie Lesley
 As she gaed oer the Border
 Shes gane like Alexander
 To spread her conquests farther

 To see her is to love her
 And love but her for ever
 For Nature made her what she is
 And never made anither

 Thou art a queen fair Lesley
 Thy subjects we before thee
 Thou art divine fair Lesley
 The hearts o men adore thee

 The deil he could na scaith thee
 Or aught that wad belang thee
 Hed look into thy bonie face
 And sayI canna wrang thee

 The Powers aboon will tent thee
 Misfortune shana steer thee
 Thourt like themselves sae lovely
 That ill theyll neer let near thee

 Return again fair Lesley
 Return to Caledonie
 That we may brag we hae a lass
 Theres nane again sae bonie




Fragment Of Song

 No cold approach no altered mien
 Just what would make suspicion start
 No pause the dire extremes between
 He made me blestand broke my heart




Ill Meet Thee On The Lea Rig

 When oer the hill the eastern star
 Tells bughtin time is near my jo
 And owsen frae the furrowd field
 Return sae dowf and weary O
 Down by the burn where birken buds
 Wi dew are hangin clear my jo
 Ill meet thee on the learig
 My ain kind Dearie O

 At midnight hour in mirkest glen
 Id rove and neer be eerie O
 If thro that glen I gaed to thee
 My ain kind Dearie O
 Altho the night were neer sae wild
 And I were neer sae weary O
 Ill meet thee on the learig
 My ain kind Dearie O

 The hunter loes the morning sun
 To rouse the mountain deer my jo
 At noon the fisher seeks the glen
 Adown the burn to steer my jo
 Gie me the hour o gloamin grey
 It maks my heart sae cheery O
 To meet thee on the learig
 My ain kind Dearie O

Highland Mary

 TuneKatherine Ogie


 Ye banks and braes and streams around
 The castle o Montgomery
 Green be your woods and fair your flowers
 Your waters never drumlie
 There Simmer first unfauld her robes
 And there the langest tarry
 For there I took the last Farewell
 O my sweet Highland Mary

 How sweetly bloomd the gay green birk
 How rich the hawthorns blossom
 As underneath their fragrant shade
 I claspd her to my bosom
 The golden Hours on angel wings
 Flew oer me and my Dearie
 For dear to me as light and life
 Was my sweet Highland Mary

 Wi mony a vow and lockd embrace
 Our parting was fu tender
 And pledging aft to meet again
 We tore oursels asunder
 But oh fell Deaths untimely frost
 That nipt my Flower sae early
 Now greens the sod and caulds the clay
 That wraps my Highland Mary

 O pale pale now those rosy lips
 I aft hae kissd sae fondly
 And closd for aye the sparkling glance
 That dwalt on me sae kindly
 And mouldering now in silent dust
 That heart that loed me dearly
 But still within my bosoms core
 Shall live my Highland Mary




Auld Rob Morris

 Theres Auld Rob Morris that wons in yon glen
 Hes the King o gude fellows and wale o auld men
 He has gowd in his coffers he has owsen and kine
 And ae bonie lass his dautie and mine

 Shes fresh as the morning the fairest in May
 Shes sweet as the evning amang the new hay
 As blythe and as artless as the lambs on the lea
 And dear to my heart as the light to my ee

 But oh shes an Heiress auld Robins a laird
 And my daddie has nought but a cothouse and yard
 A wooer like me maunna hope to come speed
 The wounds I must hide that will soon be my dead

 The day comes to me but delight brings me nane
 The night comes to me but my rest it is gane
 I wander my lane like a nighttroubled ghaist
 And I sigh as my heart it wad burst in my breast

 O had she but been of a lower degree
 I then might hae hopd she wad smild upon me
 O how past descriving had then been my bliss
 As now my distraction nae words can express




The Rights Of Woman

 An Occasional Address

 Spoken by Miss Fontenelle on her benefit night November 26 1792


 While Europes eye is fixd on mighty things
 The fate of Empires and the fall of Kings
 While quacks of State must each produce his plan
 And even children lisp the Rights of Man
 Amid this mighty fuss just let me mention
 The Rights of Woman merit some attention

 First in the Sexes intermixd connection
 One sacred Right of Woman is protection
 The tender flower that lifts its head elate
 Helpless must fall before the blasts of Fate
 Sunk on the earth defacd its lovely form
 Unless your shelter ward th impending storm

 Our second Rightbut needless here is caution
 To keep that right inviolates the fashion
 Each man of sense has it so full before him
 Hed die before hed wrong ittis decorum
 There was indeed in far less polishd days
 A time when rough rude man had naughty ways
 Would swagger swear get drunk kick up a riot
 Nay even thus invade a Ladys quiet

 Now thank our stars those Gothic times are fled
 Now wellbred menand you are all wellbred
 Most justly think and we are much the gainers
 Such conduct neither spirit wit nor manners

 For Right the third our last our best our dearest
 That right to fluttering female hearts the nearest
 Which even the Rights of Kings in low prostration
 Most humbly owntis dear dear admiration
 In that blest sphere alone we live and move
 There taste that life of lifeimmortal love
 Smiles glances sighs tears fits flirtations airs
 Gainst such an host what flinty savage dares
 When awful Beauty joins with all her charms
 Who is so rash as rise in rebel arms

 But truce with kings and truce with constitutions
 With bloody armaments and revolutions
 Let Majesty your first attention summon
 Ah ca ira The Majesty Of Woman




Epigram On Seeing Miss Fontenelle In A Favourite Character

 Sweet naivete of feature
 Simple wild enchanting elf
 Not to thee but thanks to Nature
 Thou art acting but thyself

 Wert thou awkward stiff affected
 Spurning Nature torturing art
 Loves and Graces all rejected
 Then indeed thoudst act a part




Extempore On Some Commemorations Of Thomson

 Dost thou not rise indignant shade
 And smile wi spurning scorn
 When they wha wad hae starved thy life
 Thy senseless turf adorn

 Helpless alane thou clamb the brae
 Wi meikle honest toil
 And claught th unfading garland there
 Thy sairworn rightful spoil

 And wear it thou and call aloud
 This axiom undoubted
 Would thou hae Nobles patronage
 First learn to live without it

 To whom hae much more shall be given
 Is every Great mans faith
 But he the helpless needful wretch
 Shall lose the mite he hath

A Tippling Ballad

On the Duke of Brunswicks Breaking up his Camp and the defeat of the
Austrians by Dumourier November 1792


 When Princes and Prelates
 And hotheaded zealots
 AEurope had set in a low a low
 The poor man lies down
 Nor envies a crown
 And comforts himself as he dow as he dow
 And comforts himself as he dow

 The blackheaded eagle
 As keen as a beagle
 He hunted oer height and oer howe
 In the braes o Gemappe
 He fell in a trap
 Een let him come out as he dow dow dow
 Een let him come out as he dow

 But truce with commotions
 And newfangled notions
 A bumper I trust youll allow
 Heres George our good king
 And Charlotte his queen
 And lang may they ring as they dow dow dow
 And lang may they ring as they dow

Sonnet Written On The Authors Birthday

 On hearing a Thrush sing in his Morning Walk


 Sing on sweet thrush upon the leafless bough
 Sing on sweet bird I listen to thy strain
 See aged Winter mid his surly reign
 At thy blythe carol clears his furrowed brow

 So in lone Povertys dominion drear
 Sits meek Content with light unanxious heart
 Welcomes the rapid moments bids them part
 Nor asks if they bring ought to hope or fear

 I thank thee Author of this opening day
 Thou whose bright sun now gilds yon orient skies
 Riches denied thy boon was purer joys
 What wealth could never give nor take away

 Yet come thou child of poverty and care
 The mite high heavn bestowd that mite with thee Ill share

Lovely Young Jessie

 True hearted was he the sad swain o the Yarrow
 And fair are the maids on the banks of the Ayr
 But by the sweet side o the Niths winding river
 Are lovers as faithful and maidens as fair
 To equal young Jessie seek Scotland all over
 To equal young Jessie you seek it in vain
 Grace beauty and elegance fetter her lover
 And maidenly modesty fixes the chain

 O fresh is the rose in the gay dewy morning
 And sweet is the lily at evening close
 But in the fair presence o lovely young Jessie
 Unseen is the lily unheeded the rose
 Love sits in her smile a wizard ensnaring
 Enthrond in her een he delivers his law
 And still to her charms she alone is a stranger
 Her modest demeanours the jewel of a

 The lair did address her wi matter mair moving
 A fine pacinghorse wi a clear chained bridle
 A whip by her side and a bonie sidesaddle

The Soldiers Return

 AirThe Mill mill O


 When wild wars deadly blast was blawn
 And gentle peace returning
 Wi mony a sweet babe fatherless
 And mony a widow mourning
 I left the lines and tented field
 Where lang Id been a lodger
 My humble knapsack a my wealth
 A poor and honest sodger

 A leal light heart was in my breast
 My hand unstaind wi plunder
 And for fair Scotia hame again
 I cheery on did wander
 I thought upon the banks o Coil
 I thought upon my Nancy
 I thought upon the witching smile
 That caught my youthful fancy

 At length I reachd the bonie glen
 Where early life I sported
 I passd the mill and trysting thorn
 Where Nancy aft I courted
 Wha spied I but my ain dear maid
 Down by her mothers dwelling
 And turnd me round to hide the flood
 That in my een was swelling

 Wi alterd voice quoth I Sweet lass
 Sweet as yon hawthorns blossom
 O happy happy may he be
 Thats dearest to thy bosom
 My purse is light Ive far to gang
 And fain would be thy lodger
 Ive servd my king and country lang
 Take pity on a sodger

 Sae wistfully she gazd on me
 And lovelier was than ever
 Quo she A sodger ance I loed
 Forget him shall I never
 Our humble cot and hamely fare
 Ye freely shall partake it
 That gallant badgethe dear cockade
 Yere welcome for the sake ot

 She gazdshe reddend like a rose
 Syne pale like only lily
 She sank within my arms and cried
 Art thou my ain dear Willie
 By him who made yon sun and sky
 By whom true loves regarded
 I am the man and thus may still
 True lovers be rewarded

 The wars are oer and Im come hame
 And find thee still truehearted
 Tho poor in gear were rich in love
 And mair wese neer be parted
 Quo she My grandsire left me gowd
 A mailen plenishd fairly
 And come my faithfu sodger lad
 Thourt welcome to it dearly

 For gold the merchant ploughs the main
 The farmer ploughs the manor
 But glory is the sodgers prize
 The sodgerpppps wealth is honor
 The brave poor sodger neer despise
 Nor count him as a stranger
 Remember hes his countrys stay
 In day and hour of danger

 In uproar and riot rejoice the night long

The Last Time I Came Oer The Moor

 The last time I came oer the moor
 And left Marias dwelling
 What throes what tortures passing cure
 Were in my bosom swelling
 Condemnd to see my rivals reign
 While I in secret languish
 To feel a fire in every vein
 Yet dare not speak my anguish

 Loves veriest wretch despairing I
 Fain fain my crime would cover
 Th unweeting groan the bursting sigh
 Betray the guilty lover
 I know my doom must be despair
 Thou wilt nor canst relieve me
 But oh Maria hear my prayer
 For Pitys sake forgive me

 The music of thy tongue I heard
 Nor wist while it enslavd me
 I saw thine eyes yet nothing feard
 Till fear no more had savd me
 The unwary sailor thus aghast
 The wheeling torrent viewing
 Mid circling horrors yields at last
 To overwhelming ruin




Logan Braes

 TuneLogan Water


 O Logan sweetly didst thou glide
 That day I was my Willies bride
 And years sin syne hae oer us run
 Like Logan to the simmer sun
 But now thy flowery banks appear
 Like drumlie Winter dark and drear
 While my dear lad maun face his faes
 Far far frae me and Logan braes

 Again the merry month of May
 Has made our hills and valleys gay
 The birds rejoice in leafy bowers
 The bees hum round the breathing flowers
 Blythe Morning lifts his rosy eye
 And Evenings tears are tears o joy
 My soul delightless a surveys
 While Willies far frae Logan braes

 Within yon milkwhite hawthorn bush
 Amang her nestlings sits the thrush
 Her faithfu mate will share her toil
 Or wi his song her cares beguile
 But I wi my sweet nurslings here
 Nae mate to help nae mate to cheer
 Pass widowd nights and joyless days
 While Willies far frae Logan braes

 O wae be to you Men o State
 That brethren rouse to deadly hate
 As ye make mony a fond heart mourn
 Sae may it on your heads return
 How can your flinty hearts enjoy
 The widows tear the orphans cry
 But soon may peace bring happy days
 And Willie hame to Logan braes




Blythe Hae I been On Yon Hill

 TuneThe Quakers Wife


 Blythe hae I been on yon hill
 As the lambs before me
 Careless ilka thought and free
 As the breeze flew oer me
 Now nae langer sport and play
 Mirth or sang can please me
 Lesley is sae fair and coy
 Care and anguish seize me

 Heavy heavy is the task
 Hopeless love declaring
 Trembling I dow nocht but glowr
 Sighing dumb despairing
 If she winna ease the thraws
 In my bosom swelling
 Underneath the grassgreen sod
 Soon maun be my dwelling




O Were My Love Yon Lilac Fair

 AirHughie Graham


 O were my love yon Lilac fair
 Wi purple blossoms to the Spring
 And I a bird to shelter there
 When wearied on my little wing
 How I wad mourn when it was torn
 By Autumn wild and Winter rude
 But I wad sing on wanton wing
 When youthfu May its bloom renewd

 O gin my love were yon red rose
 That grows upon the castle wa
 And I myself a drap o dew
 Into her bonie breast to fa
 O there beyond expression blest
 Id feast on beauty a the night
 Seald on her silksaft faulds to rest
 Till fleyd awa by Phoebus light




Bonie JeanA Ballad

 To its ain tune


 There was a lass and she was fair
 At kirk or market to be seen
 When a our fairest maids were met
 The fairest maid was bonie Jean

 And aye she wrought her mammies wark
 And aye she sang sae merrilie
 The blythest bird upon the bush
 Had neer a lighter heart than she

 But hawks will rob the tender joys
 That bless the little lintwhites nest
 And frost will blight the fairest flowers
 And love will break the soundest rest

 Young Robie was the brawest lad
 The flower and pride of a the glen
 And he had owsen sheep and kye
 And wanton naigies nine or ten

 He gaed wi Jeanie to the tryste
 He dancd wi Jeanie on the down
 And lang ere witless Jeanie wist
 Her heart was tint her peace was stown

 As in the bosom of the stream
 The moonbeam dwells at dewy een
 So trembling pure was tender love
 Within the breast of bonie Jean

 And now she works her mammies wark
 And aye she sighs wi care and pain
 Yet wist na what her ail might be
 Or what wad make her weel again

 But did na Jeanies heart loup light
 And didna joy blink in her ee
 As Robie tauld a tale o love
 Ae eening on the lily lea

 The sun was sinking in the west
 The birds sang sweet in ilka grove
 His cheek to hers he fondly laid
 And whisperd thus his tale o love

 O Jeanie fair I loe thee dear
 O canst thou think to fancy me
 Or wilt thou leave thy mammies cot
 And learn to tent the farms wi me

 At barn or byre thou shalt na drudge
 Or naething else to trouble thee
 But stray amang the heatherbells
 And tent the waving corn wi me

 Now what could artless Jeanie do
 She had nae will to say him na
 At length she blushd a sweet consent
 And love was aye between them twa




Lines On John MMurdo ESQ

 Blest be MMurdo to his latest day
 No envious cloud oercast his evening ray
 No wrinkle furrowd by the hand of care
 Nor ever sorrow add one silver hair
 O may no son the fathers honour stain
 Nor ever daughter give the mother pain




Epitaph On A LapDog

 Named Echo


 In wood and wild ye warbling throng
 Your heavy loss deplore
 Now half extinct your powers of song
 Sweet Echo is no more

 Ye jarring screeching things around
 Scream your discordant joys
 Now half your din of tuneless sound
 With Echo silent lies




Epigrams Against The Earl Of Galloway

 What dost thou in that mansion fair
 Flit Galloway and find
 Some narrow dirty dungeon cave
 The picture of thy mind

 No Stewart art thou Galloway
 The Stewarts ll were brave
 Besides the Stewarts were but fools
 Not one of them a knave

 Bright ran thy line O Galloway
 Thro many a farfamd sire
 So ran the farfamed Roman way
 And ended in a mire

 Spare me thy vengeance Galloway
 In quiet let me live
 I ask no kindness at thy hand
 For thou hast none to give




Epigram On The Laird Of Laggan

 When Morine deceasd to the Devil went down
 Twas nothing would serve him but Satans own crown
 Thy fools head quoth Satan that crown shall wear never
 I grant thourt as wicked but not quite so clever




SongPhillis The Fair

 TuneRobin Adair


 While larks with little wing
 Fannd the pure air
 Tasting the breathing Spring
 Forth I did fare
 Gay the suns golden eye
 Peepd oer the mountains high
 Such thy morn did I cry
 Phillis the fair

 In each birds careless song
 Glad I did share
 While yon wildflowers among
 Chance led me there
 Sweet to the opning day
 Rosebuds bent the dewy spray
 Such thy bloom did I say
 Phillis the fair

 Down in a shady walk
 Doves cooing were
 I markd the cruel hawk
 Caught in a snare
 So kind may fortune be
 Such make his destiny
 He who would injure thee
 Phillis the fair




SongHad I A Cave

 TuneRobin Adair


 Had I a cave on some wild distant shore
 Where the winds howl to the waves dashing roar
 There would I weep my woes
 There seek my lost repose
 Till grief my eyes should close
 Neer to wake more

 Falsest of womankind canst thou declare
 All thy fond plighted vows fleeting as air
 To thy new lover hie
 Laugh oer thy perjury
 Then in thy bosom try
 What peace is there




SongBy Allan Stream

 By Allan stream I chancd to rove
 While Phoebus sank beyond Benledi
 The winds are whispering thro the grove
 The yellow corn was waving ready
 I listend to a lovers sang
 An thought on youthfu pleasures mony
 And aye the wildwood echoes rang
 O dearly do I love thee Annie

 O happy be the woodbine bower
 Nae nightly bogle make it eerie
 Nor ever sorrow stain the hour
 The place and time I met my Dearie
 Her head upon my throbbing breast
 She sinking said Im thine for ever
 While mony a kiss the seal imprest
 The sacred vow we neer should sever

 The haunt o Springs the primrosebrae
 The Summer joys the flocks to follow
 How cheery thro her shortning day
 Is Autumn in her weeds o yellow
 But can they melt the glowing heart
 Or chain the soul in speechless pleasure
 Or thro each nerve the rapture dart
 Like meeting her our bosoms treasure

 And whiles ye may lightly my beauty awee

Phillis The Queen O The Fair

 TuneThe Muckin o Geordies Byre


 Adown winding Nith I did wander
 To mark the sweet flowers as they spring
 Adown winding Nith I did wander
 Of Phillis to muse and to sing

 ChorusAwa wi your belles and your beauties
 They never wi her can compare
 Whaever has met wi my Phillis
 Has met wi the queen o the fair

 The daisy amusd my fond fancy
 So artless so simple so wild
 Thou emblem said I o my Phillis
 For she is Simplicitys child
 Awa wi your belles c

 The rosebuds the blush o my charmer
 Her sweet balmy lip when tis prest
 How fair and how pure is the lily
 But fairer and purer her breast
 Awa wi your belles c

 Yon knot of gay flowers in the arbour
 They neer wi my Phillis can vie
 Her breath is the breath of the woodbine
 Its dewdrop o diamond her eye
 Awa wi your belles c

 Her voice is the song o the morning
 That wakes thro the greenspreading grove
 When Phoebus peeps over the mountains
 On music and pleasure and love
 Awa wi your belles c

 But beauty how frail and how fleeting
 The bloom of a fine summers day
 While worth in the mind o my Phillis
 Will flourish without a decay
 Awa wi your belles c

 Come let me take thee to my breast
 And pledge we neer shall sunder
 And I shall spurn as vilest dust
 The worlds wealth and grandeur

 That I may live to love her

 Thus in my arms wi a her charms
 I clasp my countless treasure
 Ill seek nae main o Heavn to share
 Tha sic a moments pleasure
 And by thy een sae bonie blue
 I swear Im thine for ever
 And on thy lips I seal my vow
 And break it shall I never

 To steal upon her early fare

 To meet my faithfu Davie

 When day expiring in the west
 The curtain draws o Natures rest
 I flee to his arms I loe the best
 And thats my ain dear Davie

Robert Bruces March To Bannockburn

 Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled
 Scots wham Bruce has aften led
 Welcome to your gory bed
 Or to Victorie

 Nows the day and nows the hour
 See the front o battle lour
 See approach proud Edwards power
 Chains and Slaverie

 Wha will be a traitor knave
 Wha can fill a cowards grave
 Wha sae base as be a Slave
 Let him turn and flee

 Wha for Scotlands King and Law
 Freedoms sword will strongly draw
 Freeman stand or Freeman fa
 Let him on wi me

 By Oppressions woes and pains
 By your Sons in servile chains
 We will drain our dearest veins
 But they shall be free

 Lay the proud Usurpers low
 Tyrants fall in every foe
 Libertys in every blow
 Let us Do or Die




Behold The Hour The Boat Arrive

 Behold the hour the boat arrive
 Thou goest the darling of my heart
 Severd from thee can I survive
 But Fate has willd and we must part
 Ill often greet the surging swell
 Yon distant Isle will often hail
 Een here I took the last farewell
 There latest markd her vanishd sail
 Along the solitary shore
 While flitting seafowl round me cry
 Across the rolling dashing roar
 Ill westward turn my wistful eye
 Happy thou Indian grove Ill say
 Where now my Nancys path may be
 While thro thy sweets she loves to stray
 O tell me does she muse on me




Down The Burn Davie

 As down the burn they took their way
 And thro the flowery dale
 His cheek to hers he aft did lay
 And love was aye the tale

 With Mary when shall we return
 Sic pleasure to renew
 Quoth MaryLove I like the burn
 And aye shall follow you




Thou Hast Left Me Ever Jamie

 TuneFee him father fee him


 Thou hast left me ever Jamie
 Thou hast left me ever

 Aften hast thou vowd that Death
 Only should us sever
 Now thoust left thy lass for aye
 I maun see thee never Jamie

 Thou hast me forsaken Jamie
 Thou hast me forsaken
 Thou hast me forsaken Jamie
 Thou hast me forsaken
 Thou canst love another jo
 While my heart is breaking
 Soon my weary een Ill close
 Never mair to waken Jamie
 Never mair to waken




Where Are The Joys I have Met

 TuneSaw ye my father


 Where are the joys I have met in the morning
 That dancd to the larks early song
 Where is the peace that awaited my wandring
 At evening the wildwoods among

 No more a winding the course of yon river
 And marking sweet flowerets so fair
 No more I trace the light footsteps of Pleasure
 But Sorrow and sadsighing Care

 Is it that Summers forsaken our valleys
 And grim surly Winter is near
 No no the bees humming round the gay roses
 Proclaim it the pride of the year

 Fain would I hide what I fear to discover
 Yet long long too well have I known
 All that has caused this wreck in my bosom
 Is Jenny fair Jenny alone

 Time cannot aid me my griefs are immortal
 Nor Hope dare a comfort bestow
 Come then enamourd and fond of my anguish
 Enjoyment Ill seek in my woe




Deluded Swain The Pleasure

 TuneThe Colliers Dochter


 Deluded swain the pleasure
 The fickle Fair can give thee
 Is but a fairy treasure
 Thy hopes will soon deceive thee
 The billows on the ocean
 The breezes idly roaming
 The clouds uncertain motion
 They are but types of Woman

 O art thou not ashamd
 To doat upon a feature
 If Man thou wouldst be namd
 Despise the silly creature
 Go find an honest fellow
 Good claret set before thee
 Hold on till thou art mellow
 And then to bed in glory




Thine Am I My Faithful Fair

 TuneThe Quakers Wife


 Thine am I my faithful Fair
 Thine my lovely Nancy
 Evry pulse along my veins
 Evry roving fancy
 To thy bosom lay my heart
 There to throb and languish
 Tho despair had wrung its core
 That would heal its anguish

 Take away those rosy lips
 Rich with balmy treasure
 Turn away thine eyes of love
 Lest I die with pleasure
 What is life when wanting Love
 Night without a morning
 Loves the cloudless summer sun
 Nature gay adorning




On Mrs Riddells Birthday

 4th November 1793


 Old Winter with his frosty beard
 Thus once to Jove his prayer preferred
 What have I done of all the year
 To bear this hated doom severe

 My cheerless suns no pleasure know
 Nights horrid car drags dreary slow
 My dismal months no joys are crowning
 But spleeny English hanging drowning

 Now Jove for once be mighty civil
 To counterbalance all this evil
 Give me and Ive no more to say
 Give me Marias natal day
 That brilliant gift shall so enrich me
 Spring Summer Autumn cannot match me
 Tis done says Jove so ends my story
 And Winter once rejoiced in glory




My Spouse Nancy

 TuneMy Jo Janet


 Husband husband cease your strife
 Nor longer idly rave Sir
 Tho I am your wedded wife
 Yet I am not your slave Sir

 One of two must still obey
 Nancy Nancy
 Is it Man or Woman say
 My spouse Nancy

 If tis still the lordly word
 Service and obedience
 Ill desert my sovreign lord
 And so good bye allegiance

 Sad shall I be so bereft
 Nancy Nancy
 Yet Ill try to make a shift
 My spouse Nancy

 My poor heart then break it must
 My last hour I am near it
 When you lay me in the dust
 Think how you will bear it

 I will hope and trust in Heaven
 Nancy Nancy
 Strength to bear it will be given
 My spouse Nancy

 Well Sir from the silent dead
 Still Ill try to daunt you
 Ever round your midnight bed
 Horrid sprites shall haunt you

 Ill wed another like my dear
 Nancy Nancy
 Then all hell will fly for fear
 My spouse Nancy




Address

Spoken by Miss Fontenelle on her Benefit Night December 4th 1793
at the Theatre Dumfries


 Still anxious to secure your partial favour
 And not less anxious sure this night than ever
 A Prologue Epilogue or some such matter
 Twould vamp my bill said I if nothing better
 So sought a poet roosted near the skies
 Told him I came to feast my curious eyes
 Said nothing like his works was ever printed
 And last my prologuebusiness slily hinted
 Maam let me tell you quoth my man of rhymes
 I know your bentthese are no laughing times
 Can youbut Miss I own I have my fears
 Dissolve in pause and sentimental tears
 With laden sighs and solemnrounded sentence
 Rouse from his sluggish slumbers fell Repentance
 Paint Vengeance as he takes his horrid stand
 Waving on high the desolating brand
 Calling the storms to bear him oer a guilty land

 I could no moreaskance the creature eyeing
 Dye think said I this face was made for crying
 Ill laugh thats poznay more the world shall know it
 And so your servant gloomy Master Poet

 Firm as my creed Sirs tis my fixd belief
 That Miserys another word for Grief
 I also thinkso may I be a bride
 That so much laughter so much life enjoyd

 Thou man of crazy care and ceaseless sigh
 Still under bleak Misfortunes blasting eye
 Doomd to that sorest task of man alive
 To make three guineas do the work of five
 Laugh in Misfortunes facethe beldam witch
 Say youll be merry tho you cant be rich

 Thou other man of care the wretch in love
 Who long with jiltish airs and arts hast strove
 Who as the boughs all temptingly project
 Measurst in desperate thoughta ropethy neck
 Or where the beetling cliff oerhangs the deep
 Peerest to meditate the healing leap
 Wouldst thou be curd thou silly moping elf
 Laugh at her follieslaugh een at thyself
 Learn to despise those frowns now so terrific
 And love a kinderthats your grand specific

 To sum up all be merry I advise
 And as were merry may we still be wise




Complimentary Epigram On Maria Riddell

 Praise Woman still his lordship roars
 Deservd or not no matter
 But thee whom all my soul adores
 Evn Flattery cannot flatter

 Maria all my thought and dream
 Inspires my vocal shell
 The more I praise my lovely theme
 The more the truth I tell




1794




Remorseful Apology

 The friend whom wild from Wisdoms way
 The fumes of wine infuriate send
 Not moony madness more astray
 Who but deplores that hapless friend

 Mine was th insensate frenzied part
 Ah why should I such scenes outlive
 Scenes so abhorrent to my heart
 Tis thine to pity and forgive




Wilt Thou Be My Dearie

 TuneThe Sutors Dochter


 Wilt thou be my Dearie
 When Sorrow wring thy gentle heart
 O wilt thou let me cheer thee
 By the treasure of my soul
 Thats the love I bear thee
 I swear and vow that only thou
 Shall ever be my Dearie
 Only thou I swear and vow
 Shall ever be my Dearie

 Lassie say thou loes me
 Or if thou wilt na be my ain
 O say na thoult refuse me
 If it winna canna be
 Thou for thine may choose me
 Let me lassie quickly die
 Still trusting that thou loes me
 Lassie let me quickly die
 Still trusting that thou loes me




A Fiddler In The North

 TuneThe King o France he rade a race


 Amang the trees where humming bees
 At buds and flowers were hinging O
 Auld Caledon drew out her drone
 And to her pipe was singing O
 Twas Pibroch Sang Strathspeys and Reels
 She dirld them aff fu clearly O
 When there cam a yell o foreign squeels
 That dang her tapsalteerie O

 Their capon craws an queer ha has
 They made our lugs grow eerie O
 The hungry bike did scrape and fyke
 Till we were wae and weary O
 But a royal ghaist wha ance was casd
 A prisoner aughteen year awa
 He fird a Fiddler in the North
 That dang them tapsalteerie O




The Minstrel At Lincluden

 TuneCumnock Psalms


 As I stood by yon roofless tower
 Where the waflowr scents the dery air
 Where the howlet mourns in her ivy bower
 And tells the midnight moon her care

 ChorusA lassie all alone was making her moan
 Lamenting our lads beyond the sea
 In the bluidy wars they fa and our honours gane an a
 And brokenhearted we maun die

 The winds were laid the air was till
 The stars they shot along the sky
 The tod was howling on the hill
 And the distantechoing glens reply
 A lassie all alone c

 The burn adown its hazelly path
 Was rushing by the ruind wa
 Hasting to join the sweeping Nith
 Whase roarings seemd to rise and fa
 A lassie all alone c

 The cauld blae North was streaming forth
 Her lights wi hissing eerie din
 Athort the lift they start and shift
 Like Fortunes favours tint as win
 A lassie all alone c

 Now looking over firth and fauld
 Her horn the palefaced Cynthia reard
 When lo in form of Minstrel auld
 A stern and stalwart ghaist appeard
 A lassie all alone c

 And frae his harp sic strains did flow
 Might rousd the slumbering Dead to hear
 But oh it was a tale of woe
 As ever met a Britons ear
 A lassie all alone c

 He sang wi joy his former day
 He weeping waild his latter times
 But what he saidit was nae play
 I winna venturet in my rhymes
 A lassie all alone c




A Vision

 As I stood by yon roofless tower
 Where the waflower scents the dewy air
 Where the howlet mourns in her ivy bower
 And tells the midnight moon her care

 The winds were laid the air was still
 The stars they shot alang the sky
 The fox was howling on the hill
 And the distant echoing glens reply

 The stream adown its hazelly path
 Was rushing by the ruind was
 Hasting to join the sweeping Nith
 Whase distant roaring swells and fas

 The cauld blae North was streaming forth
 Her lights wi hissing eerie din
 Athwart the lift they start and shift
 Like Fortunes favors tint as win

 By heedless chance I turnd mine eyes
 And by the moonbeam shook to see
 A stern and stalwart ghaist arise
 Attird as Minstrels wont to be

 Had I a statue been o stane
 His daring look had daunted me
 And on his bonnet gravd was plain
 The sacred posyLibertie

 And frae his harp sic strains did flow
 Might rousd the slumbring Dead to hear
 But oh it was a tale of woe
 As ever met a Britons ear

 He sang wi joy his former day
 He weeping wailed his latter times
 But what he saidit was nae play
 I winna venturet in my rhymes

Young Jamie Pride Of A The Plain

 TuneThe Carlin of the Glen


 Young Jamie pride of a the plain
 Sae gallant and sae gay a swain
 Thro a our lasses he did rove
 And reignd resistless King of Love

 But now wi sighs and starting tears
 He strays amang the woods and breirs
 Or in the glens and rocky caves
 His sad complaining dowie raves

 I wha sae late did range and rove
 And changd with every moon my love
 I little thought the time was near
 Repentance I should buy sae dear

 The slighted maids my torments see
 And laugh at a the pangs I dree
 While she my cruel scornful Fair
 Forbids me eer to see her mair




The Flowery Banks Of Cree

 Here is the glen and here the bower
 All underneath the birchen shade
 The villagebell has told the hour
 O what can stay my lovely maid

 Tis not Marias whispering call
 Tis but the balmy breathing gale
 Mixt with some warblers dying fall
 The dewy star of eve to hail

 It is Marias voice I hear
 So calls the woodlark in the grove
 His little faithful mate to cheer
 At once tis music and tis love

 And art thou come and art thou true
 O welcome dear to love and me
 And let us all our vows renew
 Along the flowery banks of Cree




Monody

 On a lady famed for her Caprice


 How cold is that bosom which folly once fired
 How pale is that cheek where the rouge lately glistend
 How silent that tongue which the echoes oft tired
 How dull is that ear which to flattry so listend

 If sorrow and anguish their exit await
 From friendship and dearest affection removd
 How doubly severer Maria thy fate
 Thou diedst unwept as thou livedst unlovd

 Loves Graces and Virtues I call not on you
 So shy grave and distant ye shed not a tear
 But come all ye offspring of Folly so true
 And flowers let us cull for Marias cold bier

 Well search through the garden for each silly flower
 Well roam thro the forest for each idle weed
 But chiefly the nettle so typical shower
 For none eer approachd her but rued the rash deed

 Well sculpture the marble well measure the lay
 Here Vanity strums on her idiot lyre
 There keen Indignation shall dart on his prey
 Which spurning Contempt shall redeem from his ire




The Epitaph

 Here lies now a prey to insulting neglect
 What once was a butterfly gay in lifes beam
 Want only of wisdom denied her respect
 Want only of goodness denied her esteem




Pinned To Mrs Walter Riddells Carriage

 If you rattle along like your Mistress tongue
 Your speed will outrival the dart
 But a fly for your load youll break down on the road
 If your stuff be as rottens her heart




Epitaph For Mr Walter Riddell

 Sic a reptile was Wat sic a miscreant slave
 That the worms evn damnd him when laid in his grave
 In his flesh theres a famine a starved reptile cries
 And his heart is rank poison another replies




Epistle From Esopus To Maria

 From those drear solitudes and frowsy cells
 Where Infamy with sad Repentance dwells
 Where turnkeys make the jealous portal fast
 And deal from iron hands the spare repast
 Where truant prentices yet young in sin
 Blush at the curious stranger peeping in
 Where strumpets relics of the drunken roar
 Resolve to drink nay half to whore no more
 Where tiny thieves not destind yet to swing
 Beat hemp for others riper for the string
 From these dire scenes my wretched lines I date
 To tell Maria her Esopus fate

 Alas I feel I am no actor here
 Tis real hangmen real scourges bear
 Prepare Maria for a horrid tale
 Will turn thy very rouge to deadly pale
 Will make thy hair tho erst from gipsy polld
 By barber woven and by barber sold
 Though twisted smooth with Harrys nicest care
 Like hoary bristles to erect and stare
 The hero of the mimic scene no more
 I start in Hamlet in Othello roar
 Or haughty Chieftain mid the din of arms
 In Highland Bonnet woo Malvinas charms
 While sansculottes stoop up the mountain high
 And steal from me Marias prying eye
 Blest Highland bonnet once my proudest dress
 Now prouder still Marias temples press
 I see her wave thy towering plumes afar
 And call each coxcomb to the wordy war
 I see her face the first of Irelands sons
 And even outIrish his Hibernian bronze
 The crafty Colonel leaves the tartand lines
 For other wars where he a hero shines
 The hopeful youth in Scottish senate bred
 Who owns a Bushbys heart without the head
 Comes mid a string of coxcombs to display
 That veni vidi vici is his way
 The shrinking Bard adown the alley skulks
 And dreads a meeting worse than Woolwich hulks
 Though there his heresies in Church and State
 Might well award him Muir and Palmers fate
 Still she undaunted reels and rattles on
 And dares the public like a noontide sun
 What scandal called Marias jaunty stagger
 The ricket reeling of a crooked swagger
 Whose spleen een worse than Burns venom when
 He dips in gall unmixd his eager pen
 And pours his vengeance in the burning line
 Who christend thus Marias lyredivine
 The idiot strum of Vanity bemusd
 And even the abuse of Poesy abusd
 Who called her verse a Parish Workhouse made
 For motley foundling Fancies stolen or strayed

 A Workhouse ah that sound awakes my woes
 And pillows on the thorn my rackd repose
 In durance vile here must I wake and weep
 And all my frowsy couch in sorrow steep
 That straw where many a rogue has lain of yore
 And vermind gipsies litterd heretofore

 Why Lonsdale thus thy wrath on vagrants pour
 Must earth no rascal save thyself endure
 Must thou alone in guilt immortal swell
 And make a vast monopoly of hell
 Thou knowst the Virtues cannot hate thee worse
 The Vices also must they club their curse
 Or must no tiny sin to others fall
 Because thy guilts supreme enough for all

 Maria send me too thy griefs and cares
 In all of thee sure thy Esopus shares
 As thou at all mankind the flag unfurls
 Who on my fair one Satires vengeance hurls
 Who calls thee pert affected vain coquette
 A wit in folly and a fool in wit
 Who says that fool alone is not thy due
 And quotes thy treacheries to prove it true

 Our force united on thy foes well turn
 And dare the war with all of woman born
 For who can write and speak as thou and I
 My periods that deciphering defy
 And thy still matchless tongue that conquers all reply




Epitaph On A Noted Coxcomb

 Capt Wm Roddirk of Corbiston

 Light lay the earth on Billys breast
 His chicken heart so tender
 But build a castle on his head
 His scull will prop it under




On Capt Lascelles

 When Lascelles thought fit from this world to depart
 Some friends warmly thought of embalming his heart
 A bystander whispersPray dont make so much ot
 The subject is poison no reptile will touch it




On Wm Graham Esq Of Mossknowe

 Stop thief dame Nature calld to Death
 As Willy drew his latest breath
 How shall I make a fool again
 My choicest model thou hast taen




On John Bushby Esq Tinwald Downs

 Here lies John Bushbyhonest man
 Cheat him Devilif you can




Sonnet On The Death Of Robert Riddell

 Of Glenriddell and Friars Carse


 No more ye warblers of the wood no more
 Nor pour your descant grating on my soul
 Thou youngeyed Spring gay in thy verdant stole
 More welcome were to me grim Winters wildest roar

 How can ye charm ye flowers with all your dyes
 Ye blow upon the sod that wraps my friend
 How can I to the tuneful strain attend
 That strain flows round the untimely tomb where Riddell lies

 Yes pour ye warblers pour the notes of woe
 And soothe the Virtues weeping oer his bier
 The man of worthand hath not left his peer
 Is in his narrow house for ever darkly low

 Thee Spring again with joy shall others greet
 Me memory of my loss will only meet

 That ever blest a womans ee

 Now wae to thee thou cruel lord
 A bluidy man I trow thou be
 For mony a heart thou has made sair
 That neer did wrang to thine or thee

 Brawlie kens our wanton Chief
 Wha gat my young Highland thief

 Leeze me on thy bonie craigie
 An thou live thoull steal a naigie

The Highland Widows Lament

 Oh I am come to the low Countrie
 Ochon Ochon Ochrie
 Without a penny in my purse
 To buy a meal to me

 It was na sae in the Highland hills
 Ochon Ochon Ochrie
 Nae woman in the Country wide
 Sae happy was as me

 For then I had a score okye
 Ochon Ochon Ochrie
 Feeding on you hill sae high
 And giving milk to me

 And there I had three score oyowes
 Ochon Ochon Ochrie
 Skipping on yon bonie knowes
 And casting woo to me

 I was the happiest of a the Clan
 Sair sair may I repine
 For Donald was the brawest man
 And Donald he was mine

 Till Charlie Stewart cam at last
 Sae far to set us free
 My Donalds arm was wanted then
 For Scotland and for me

 Their waefu fate what need I tell
 Right to the wrang did yield
 My Donald and his Country fell
 Upon Culloden field

 Oh I am come to the low Countrie
 Ochon Ochon Ochrie
 Nae woman in the warld wide
 Sae wretched now as me




It Was A For Our Rightfu King

 It was a for our rightfu King
 We left fair Scotlands strand
 It was a for our rightfu King
 We eer saw Irish land my dear
 We eer saw Irish land

 Now a is done that men can do
 And a is done in vain
 My Love and Native Land fareweel
 For I maun cross the main my dear
 For I maun cross the main

 He turnd him right and round about
 Upon the Irish shore
 And gae his bridle reins a shake
 With adieu for evermore my dear
 And adiue for evermore

 The soger frae the wars returns
 The sailor frae the main
 But I hae parted frae my Love
 Never to meet again my dear
 Never to meet again

 When day is gane and night is come
 And a folk bound to sleep
 I think on him thats far awa
 The leelang night and weep my dear
 The leelang night and weep




Ode For General Washingtons Birthday

 No Spartan tube no Attic shell
 No lyre Aeolian I awake
 Tis libertys bold note I swell
 Thy harp Columbia let me take
 See gathering thousands while I sing
 A broken chain exulting bring
 And dash it in a tyrants face
 And dare him to his very beard
 And tell him he no more is feared
 No more the despot of Columbias race
 A tyrants proudest insults bravd
 They shouta People freed They hail an Empire saved
 Where is mans godlike form
 Where is that brow erect and bold
 That eye that can unmovd behold
 The wildest rage the loudest storm
 That eer created fury dared to raise
 Avaunt thou caitiff servile base
 That tremblest at a despots nod
 Yet crouching under the iron rod
 Canst laud the hand that struck th insulting blow
 Art thou of mans Imperial line
 Dost boast that countenance divine
 Each skulking feature answers No
 But come ye sons of Liberty
 Columbias offspring brave as free
 In dangers hour still flaming in the van
 Ye know and dare maintain the Royalty of Man

 Alfred on thy starry throne
 Surrounded by the tuneful choir
 The bards that erst have struck the patriot lyre
 And rousd the freeborn Britons soul of fire
 No more thy England own
 Dare injured nations form the great design
 To make detested tyrants bleed
 Thy England execrates the glorious deed
 Beneath her hostile banners waving
 Every pang of honour braving
 England in thunder calls The tyrants cause is mine
 That hour accurst how did the fiends rejoice
 And hell thro all her confines raise the exulting voice
 That hour which saw the generous English name
 Linkt with such damned deeds of everlasting shame

 Thee Caledonia thy wild heaths among
 Famd for the martial deed the heaventaught song
 To thee I turn with swimming eyes
 Where is that soul of Freedom fled
 Immingled with the mighty dead
 Beneath that hallowd turf where Wallace lies
 Hear it not Wallace in thy bed of death
 Ye babbling winds in silence sweep
 Disturb not ye the heros sleep
 Nor give the coward secret breath
 Is this the ancient Caledonian form
 Firm as the rock resistless as the storm
 Show me that eye which shot immortal hate
 Blasting the despots proudest bearing
 Show me that arm which nervd with thundering fate
 Crushd Usurpations boldest daring
 Darkquenchd as yonder sinking star
 No more that glance lightens afar
 That palsied arm no more whirls on the waste of war




Inscription To Miss Graham Of Fintry

 Here where the Scottish Muse immortal lives
 In sacred strains and tuneful numbers joined
 Accept the gift though humble he who gives
 Rich is the tribute of the grateful mind

 So may no ruffianfeeling in my breast
 Discordant jar thy bosomchords among
 But Peace attune thy gentle soul to rest
 Or Love ecstatic wake his seraph song

 Or Pitys notes in luxury of tears
 As modest Want the tale of woe reveals
 While conscious Virtue all the strains endears
 And heavenborn Piety her sanction seals




On The Seas And Far Away

 TuneOer the hills and far away


 How can my poor heart be glad
 When absent from my sailor lad
 How can I the thought forego
 Hes on the seas to meet the foe
 Let me wander let me rove
 Still my heart is with my love
 Nightly dreams and thoughts by day
 Are with him thats far away

 ChorusOn the seas and far away
 On stormy seas and far away
 Nightly dreams and thoughts by day
 Are aye with him thats far away

 When in summer noon I faint
 As weary flocks around me pant
 Haply in this scorching sun
 My sailors thundring at his gun
 Bullets spare my only joy
 Bullets spare my darling boy
 Fate do with me what you may
 Spare but him thats far away
 On the seas and far away
 On stormy seas and far away
 Fate do with me what you may
 Spare but him thats far away

 At the starless midnight hour
 When Winter rules with boundless power
 As the storms the forests tear
 And thunders rend the howling air
 Listening to the doubling roar
 Surging on the rocky shore
 All I canI weep and pray
 For his weal thats far away
 On the seas and far away
 On stormy seas and far away
 All I canI weep and pray
 For his weal thats far away

 Peace thy olive wand extend
 And bid wild War his ravage end
 Man with brother Man to meet
 And as a brother kindly greet
 Then may heavn with prosperous gales
 Fill my sailors welcome sails
 To my arms their charge convey
 My dear lad thats far away
 On the seas and far away
 On stormy seas and far away
 To my arms their charge convey
 My dear lad thats far away

She Says She Loes Me Best Of A

 TuneOonaghs Waterfall


 Sae flaxen were her ringlets
 Her eyebrows of a darker hue
 Bewitchingly oerarching
 Twa laughing een o lovely blue
 Her smiling sae wyling
 Wad make a wretch forget his woe
 What pleasure what treasure
 Unto these rosy lips to grow
 Such was my Chloris bonie face
 When first that bonie face I saw
 And aye my Chloris dearest charm
 She says she loes me best of a

 Like harmony her motion
 Her pretty ankle is a spy
 Betraying fair proportion
 Wad make a saint forget the sky
 Sae warming sae charming
 Her faultless form and gracefu air

 Declard that she could do nae mair
 Hers are the willing chains o love
 By conquering Beautys sovereign law
 And still my Chloris dearest charm
 She says she loes me best of a

 Let others love the city
 And gaudy show at sunny noon
 Gie me the lonely valley
 The dewy eve and rising moon
 Fair beaming and streaming
 Her silver light the boughs amang
 While falling recalling
 The amorous thrush concludes his sang
 There dearest Chloris wilt thou rove
 By wimpling burn and leafy shaw
 And hear my vows o truth and love
 And say thou loes me best of a

Inconstancy In Love

 TuneDuncan Gray


 Let not Woman eer complain
 Of inconstancy in love
 Let not Woman eer complain
 Fickle Man is apt to rove
 Look abroad thro Natures range
 Natures mighty Law is change
 Ladies would it not seem strange
 Man should then a monster prove

 Mark the winds and mark the skies
 Oceans ebb and oceans flow
 Sun and moon but set to rise
 Round and round the seasons go
 Why then ask of silly Man
 To oppose great Natures plan
 Well be constant while we can
 You can be no more you know




The Lovers Morning Salute To His Mistress

 TuneDeil tak the wars


 Sleepst thou or wakst thou fairest creature
 Rosy morn now lifts his eye
 Numbering ilka bud which Nature
 Waters wi the tears o joy
 Now to the streaming fountain
 Or up the heathy mountain
 The hart hind and roe freely wildlywanton stray
 In twining hazel bowers
 Its lay the linnet pours
 The laverock to the sky
 Ascends wi sangs o joy
 While the sun and thou arise to bless the day

 Phoebus gilding the brow of morning
 Banishes ilk darksome shade
 Nature gladdening and adorning
 Such to me my lovely maid
 When frae my Chloris parted
 Sad cheerless brokenhearted
 The nights gloomy shades cloudy dark oercast my sky
 But when she charms my sight
 In pride of Beautys light
 When thro my very heart
 Her burning glories dart
 Tis thentis then I wake to life and joy




The Winter Of Life

 But lately seen in gladsome green
 The woods rejoicd the day
 Thro gentle showers the laughing flowers
 In double pride were gay
 But now our joys are fled
 On winter blasts awa
 Yet maiden May in rich array
 Again shall bring them a

 But my white pow nae kindly thowe
 Shall melt the snaws of Age
 My trunk of eild but buss or beild
 Sinks in Times wintry rage
 Oh Age has weary days
 And nights o sleepless pain
 Thou golden time o Youthfu prime
 Why comes thou not again




Behold My Love How Green The Groves

 TuneMy lodging is on the cold ground


 Behold my love how green the groves
 The primrose banks how fair
 The balmy gales awake the flowers
 And wave thy flowing hair

 The lavrock shuns the palace gay
 And oer the cottage sings
 For Nature smiles as sweet I ween
 To Shepherds as to Kings

 Let minstrels sweep the skilfu string
 In lordly lighted ha
 The Shepherd stops his simple reed
 Blythe in the birken shaw

 The Princely revel may survey
 Our rustic dance wi scorn
 But are their hearts as light as ours
 Beneath the milkwhite thorn

 The shepherd in the flowery glen
 In shepherds phrase will woo
 The courtier tells a finer tale
 But is his heart as true

 These wildwood flowers Ive pud to deck
 That spotless breast o thine
 The courtiers gems may witness love
 But tis na love like mine




The Charming Month Of May

 TuneDaintie Davie


 It was the charming month of May
 When all the flowrs were fresh and gay
 One morning by the break of day
 The youthful charming Chloe
 From peaceful slumber she arose
 Girt on her mantle and her hose
 And oer the flowry mead she goes
 The youthful charming Chloe

 ChorusLovely was she by the dawn
 Youthful Chloe charming Chloe
 Tripping oer the pearly lawn
 The youthful charming Chloe

 The featherd people you might see
 Perchd all around on every tree
 In notes of sweetest melody
 They hail the charming Chloe
 Till painting gay the eastern skies
 The glorious sun began to rise
 Outrivald by the radiant eyes
 Of youthful charming Chloe
 Lovely was she c

Farewell Thou Stream

 AirNansies to the greenwood gane


 Farewell thou stream that winding flows
 Around Elizas dwelling
 O memry spare the cruel thoes
 Within my bosom swelling
 Condemnd to drag a hopeless chain
 And yet in secret languish
 To feel a fire in every vein
 Nor dare disclose my anguish

 Loves veriest wretch unseen unknown
 I fain my griefs would cover
 The bursting sigh th unweeting groan
 Betray the hapless lover
 I know thou doomst me to despair
 Nor wilt nor canst relieve me
 But O Eliza hear one prayer
 For pitys sake forgive me

 The music of thy voice I heard
 Nor wist while it enslavd me
 I saw thine eyes yet nothing feard
 Till fears no more had savd me
 Th unwary sailor thus aghast
 The wheeling torrent viewing
 Mid circling horrors sinks at last
 In overwhelming ruin

 Thus cruelly to part my Katie
 Is this thy faithful swains reward
 An aching broken heart my Katie
 Canst thou leave me c

 Farewell and neer such sorrows tear
 That finkle heart of thine my Katie
 Thou maysn find those will love thee dear
 But not a love like mine my Katie
 Canst thou leave me c

 Lang lang has Joy been a stranger to me
 Forsaken and friendless my burden I bear

 Down by yon stream and yon bonie castlegreen
 For there he is wandring and musing on me
 Wha wad soon dry the teardrop that clings to my ee

Craigieburn Wood

 Sweet fas the eve on Craigieburn
 And blythe awakes the morrow
 But a the pride o Springs return
 Can yield me nocht but sorrow

 I see the flowers and spreading trees
 I hear the wild birds singing
 But what a weary wight can please
 And Care his bosom wringing

 Fain fain would I my griefs impart
 Yet dare na for your anger
 But secret love will break my heart
 If I conceal it langer

 If thou refuse to pity me
 If thou shalt love another
 When yon green leaves fade frae the tree
 Around my grave theyll wither

 His setting beam neer shone upon

 But spare O spare me Jeanie dear
 O wat ye whas c

 For while lifes dearest blood is warm
 Ae thought frae her shall neer depart
 And she as fairest is her form
 She has the truest kindest heart

 TuneFy let us a to the Bridal


 Fy let us a to Kirkcudbright
 For there will be bickerin there
 For Murrays light horse are to muster
 And O how the heroes will swear
 And there will be Murray Commander
 And Gordon the battle to win
 Like brothers theyll stand by each other
 Sae knit in alliance and kin

 And there will be blacknebbit Johnie
 The tongue o the trump to them a
 An he get na Hell for his haddin
 The Deil gets na justice ava

 And there will be Kempletons birkie
 A boy no sae black at the bane
 But as to his fine Nabob fortune
 Well een let the subject alane

 And there will be Wigtons new Sheriff
 Dame Justice fu brawly has sped
 Shes gotten the heart of a Bushby
 But Lord whats become o the head
 And there will be Cardoness Esquire
 Sae mighty in Cardoness eyes
 A wight that will weather damnation
 The Devil the prey will despise

 And there will be Douglasses doughty
 New christening towns far and near
 Abjuring their democrat doings
 By kissin theo a Peer
 And there will be folk frae Saint Marys
 A house o great merit and note
 The deil ane but honours them highly
 The deil ane will gie them his vote

 And there will be Kenmure sae genrous
 Whose honour is proof to the storm
 To save them from stark reprobation
 He lent them his name in the Firm
 And there will be lads o the gospel
 Muirhead whas as gude as hes true
 And there will be Buittles Apostle
 Whas mair o the black than the blue

 And there will be Logan MDowall
 Sculduddry an he will be there
 And also the Wild Scot o Galloway
 Sogering gunpowder Blair
 But we winna mention Redcastle
 The body een let him escape
 Hed venture the gallows for siller
 An twere na the cost o the rape

 But where is the Doggerbank hero
 That made Hogan Mogan to skulk
 Poor Keiths gane to hell to be fuel
 The auld rotten wreck of a Hulk
 And where is our Kings Lord Lieutenant
 Sae famd for his gratefu return
 The birkie is gettin his Questions
 To say in Saint Stephens the morn

 But mark ye theres trusty Kerroughtree
 Whose honor was ever his law
 If the Virtues were packd in a parcel
 His worth might be sample for a
 And strang an respectfus his backing
 The maist o the lairds wi him stand
 Nae gipsylike nominal barons
 Whas propertys papernot land

 And there frae the Niddisdale borders
 The Maxwells will gather in droves
 Teugh Jockie staunch Geordie an Wellwood
 That griens for the fishes and loaves
 And there will be Heron the Major
 Whall neer be forgot in the Greys
 Our flattry well keep for some other
 Him only its justice to praise

 And there will be maiden Kilkerran
 And also Barskimmings gude Knight
 And there will be roarin Birtwhistle
 Yet luckily roars i the right
 And therell be Stamp Office Johnie
 Tak tent how ye purchase a dram
 And there will be gay Cassencarry
 And therell be gleg Colonel Tam

 And therell be wealthy young Richard
 Dame Fortune should hing by the neck
 For prodigal thriftless bestowing
 His merit had won him respect

 And there will be rich brother nabobs
 Tho Nabobs yet men not the worst
 And there will be Colliestons whiskers
 And Quintina lad o the first

 Then hey the chaste Interest o Broughton
 And hey for the blessins twill bring
 It may send Balmaghie to the Commons
 In Sodom twould make him a king
 And hey for the sanctified Murray
 Our land wha wi chapels has stord
 He founderd his horse among harlots
 But gied the auld naig to the Lord


 Ballad Third

 John Bushbys Lamentation

 TuneBabes in the Wood


 Twas in the seventeen hunder year
 O grace and ninetyfive
 That year I was the waeest man
 Of ony man alive

 In March the threeantwentieth morn
 The sun raise clear an bright
 But oh I was a waefu man
 Ere tofa o the night

 Yerl Galloway lang did rule this land
 Wi equal right and fame
 And thereto was his kinsmen joind
 The Murrays noble name

 Yerl Galloways man o men was I
 And chief o Broughtons host
 So twa blind beggars on a string
 The faithfu tyke will trust

 But now Yerl Galloways sceptres broke
 And Broughtons wi the slain
 And I my ancient craft may try
 Sin honesty is gane

 Twas by the banks o bonie Dee
 Beside Kirkcudbrights towers
 The Stewart and the Murray there
 Did muster a their powers

 Then Murray on the auld grey yaud
 Wi winged spurs did ride
 That auld grey yaud a Nidsdale rade
 He staw upon Nidside

 And there had na been the Yerl himsel
 O there had been nae play
 But Garlies was to London gane
 And sae the kye might stray

 And there was Balmaghie I ween
 In front rank he wad shine
 But Balmaghie had better been
 Drinkin Madeira wine

 And frae Glenkens cam to our aid
 A chief o doughty deed
 In case that worth should wanted be
 O Kenmure we had need

 And by our banners marchd Muirhead
 And Buittle was na slack
 Whase haly priesthood nane could stain
 For wha could dye the black

 And there was grave squire Cardoness
 Lookd on till a was done
 Sae in the tower o Cardoness
 A howlet sits at noon

 And there led I the Bushby clan
 My gamesome billie Will
 And my son Maitland wise as brave
 My footsteps followd still

 The Douglas and the Herons name
 We set nought to their score
 The Douglas and the Herons name
 Had felt our weight before

 But Douglasses o weight had we
 The pair o lusty lairds
 For building cothouses sae famd
 And christenin kailyards

 And there Redcastle drew his sword
 That neer was staind wi gore
 Save on a wandrer lame and blind
 To drive him frae his door

 And last cam creepin Collieston
 Was mair in fear than wrath
 Ae knave was constant in his mind
 To keep that knave frae scaith

The Lass That Made The Bed To Me

 When Januar wind was blawing cauld
 As to the north I took my way
 The mirksome night did me enfauld
 I knew na where to lodge till day

 By my gude luck a maid I met
 Just in the middle o my care
 And kindly she did me invite
 To walk into a chamber fair

 I bowd fu low unto this maid
 And thankd her for her courtesie
 I bowd fu low unto this maid
 An bade her make a bed to me

 She made the bed baith large and wide
 Wi twa white hands she spread it doun
 She put the cup to her rosy lips
 And drankYoung man now sleep ye soun

 ChorusThe bonie lass made the bed to me
 The braw lass made the bed to me
 Ill neer forget till the day I die
 The lass that made the bed to me

 She snatchd the candle in her hand
 And frae my chamber went wi speed
 But I calld her quickly back again
 To lay some mair below my head

 A cod she laid below my head
 And served me with due respect
 And to salute her wi a kiss
 I put my arms about her neck
 The bonie lass c

 Haud aff your hands young man she said
 And dinna sae uncivil be
 Gif ye hae ony luve for me
 O wrang na my virginitie
 Her hair was like the links o gowd
 Her teeth were like the ivorie
 Her cheeks like lilies dipt in wine
 The lass that made the bed to me
 The bonie lass c

 Her bosom was the driven snaw
 Twa drifted heaps sae fair to see
 Her limbs the polishd marble stane
 The lass that made the bed to me
 I kissd her oer and oer again
 And aye she wist na what to say
 I laid her tween me and the wa
 The lassie thocht na lang till day
 The bonie lass c

 Upon the morrow when we raise
 I thankd her for her courtesie
 But aye she blushd and aye she sighd
 And said Alas yeve ruind me
 I clapsd her waist and kissd her syne
 While the tear stood twinkling in her ee
 I said my lassie dinna cry
 For ye aye shall make the bed to me
 The bonie lass c

 She took her mithers holland sheets
 An made them a in sarks to me
 Blythe and merry may she be
 The lass that made the bed to me

 ChorusThe bonie lass made the bed to me
 The braw lass made the bed to me
 Ill neer forget till the day I die
 The lass that made the bed to me




Had I The Wyte She Bade Me

 Had I the wyte had I the wyte
 Had I the wyte she bade me
 She watchd me by the hiegate side
 And up the loan she shawd me

 And when I wadna venture in
 A coward loon she cad me
 Had Kirk an State been in the gate
 Id lighted when she bade me

 Sae craftilie she took me ben
 And bade me mak nae clatter
 For our ramgunshoch glum gudeman
 Is oer ayont the water

 Whaeer shall say I wanted grace
 When I did kiss and dawte her
 Let him be planted in my place
 Syne say I was the fautor

 Could I for shame could I for shame
 Could I for shame refusd her
 And wadna manhood been to blame
 Had I unkindly used her

 He clawd her wi the ripplinkame
 And blae and bluidy bruisd her
 When sic a husband was frae hame
 What wife but wad excusd her

 I dighted aye her een sae blue
 An bannd the cruel randy
 And weel I wat her willin mou
 Was sweet as sugarcandie

 At gloaminshot it was I wot
 I lighted on the Monday
 But I cam thro the Tysedays dew
 To wanton Willies brandy




Does Haughty Gaul Invasion Threat

 TunePush about the Jorum


 Does haughty Gaul invasion threat
 Then let the louns beware Sir
 Theres wooden walls upon our seas
 And volunteers on shore Sir
 The Nith shall run to Corsincon
 And Criffel sink in Solway
 Ere we permit a Foreign Foe
 On British ground to rally
 Well neer permit a Foreign Foe
 On British ground to rally

 O let us not like snarling curs
 In wrangling be divided
 Till slap come in an unco loun
 And wi a rung decide it
 Be Britain still to Britain true
 Amang ourselves united
 For never but by British hands
 Maun British wrangs be righted
 No never but by British hands
 Shall British wrangs be righted

 The Kettle o the Kirk and State
 Perhaps a clout may fail int
 But deil a foreign tinkler loun
 Shall ever caa nail int
 Our fathers blude the Kettle bought
 And wha wad dare to spoil it
 By Heavns the sacrilegious dog
 Shall fuel be to boil it
 By Heavns the sacrilegious dog
 Shall fuel be to boil it

 The wretch that would a tyrant own
 And the wretch his trueborn brother
 Who would set the Mob aboon the Throne
 May they be damnd together
 Who will not sing God save the King
 Shall hang as highs the steeple
 But while we sing God save the King
 Well neer forget The People
 But while we sing God save the King
 Well neer forget The People




Address To The Woodlark

 TuneLoch Erroch Side


 O stay sweet warbling woodlark stay
 Nor quit for me the trembling spray
 A hapless lover courts thy lay
 Thy soothing fond complaining
 Again again that tender part
 That I may catch thy melting art
 For surely that wad touch her heart
 Wha kills me wi disdaining
 Say was thy little mate unkind
 And heard thee as the careless wind
 Oh nocht but love and sorrow joind
 Sic notes o woe could wauken
 Thou tells o neverending care
 Ospeechless grief and dark despair
 For pitys sake sweet bird nae mair
 Or my poor heart is broken

 Heavy comes the morrow
 While my souls delight
 Is on her bed of sorrow

 Can I cease to care
 Can I cease to languish
 While my darling Fair
 Is on the couch of anguish
 Long long c

 Evry hope is fled
 Evry fear is terror
 Slumber evn I dread
 Evry dream is horror
 Long long c

 Hear me Powers Divine
 Oh in pity hear me
 Take aught else of mine
 But my Chloris spare me

How Cruel Are The Parents

 Altered from an old English song
 TuneJohn Anderson my jo


 How cruel are the parents
 Who riches only prize
 And to the wealthy booby
 Poor Woman sacrifice
 Meanwhile the hapless Daughter
 Has but a choice of strife
 To shun a tyrant Fathers hate
 Become a wretched Wife

 The ravening hawk pursuing
 The trembling dove thus flies
 To shun impelling ruin
 Awhile her pinions tries
 Till of escape despairing
 No shelter or retreat
 She trusts the ruthless Falconer
 And drops beneath his feet




Mark Yonder Pomp Of Costly Fashion

 AirDeil tak the wars


 Mark yonder pomp of costly fashion
 Round the wealthy titled bride
 But when compard with real passion
 Poor is all that princely pride
 Mark yonder c four lines repeated

 What are the showy treasures
 What are the noisy pleasures
 The gay gaudy glare of vanity and art
 The polishd jewels blaze
 May draw the wondring gaze
 And courtly grandeur bright
 The fancy may delight
 But never never can come near the heart

 But did you see my dearest Chloris
 In simplicitys array
 Lovely as yonder sweet opening flower is
 Shrinking from the gaze of day
 But did you see c

 O then the heart alarming
 And all resistless charming
 In Loves delightful fetters she chains the willing soul
 Ambition would disown
 The worlds imperial crown
 Evn Avarice would deny
 His worshippd deity
 And feel thro every vein Loves raptures roll




Twas Na Her Bonie Blue Ee

 TuneLaddie lie near me


 Twas na her bonie blue ee was my ruin
 Fair tho she be that was neer my undoin
 Twas the dear smile when nae body did mind us
 Twas the bewitching sweet stown glance o kindness
 Twas the bewitching sweet stown glance o kindness

 Sair do I fear that to hope is denied me
 Sair do I fear that despair maun abide me
 But tho fell fortune should fate us to sever
 Queen shall she be in my bosom for ever
 Queen shall she be in my bosom for ever

 Chloris Im thine wi a passion sincerest
 And thou hast plighted me love o the dearest
 And thourt the angel that never can alter
 Sooner the sun in his motion would falter
 Sooner the sun in his motion would falter




Their Groves OSweet Myrtle

 TuneHumours of Glen


 Their groves o sweet myrtle let Foreign Lands reckon
 Where brightbeaming summers exalt the perfume
 Far dearer to me yon lone glen o green breckan
 Wi the burn stealing under the lang yellow broom
 Far dearer to me are yon humble broom bowers
 Where the bluebell and gowan lurk lowly unseen
 For there lightly tripping among the wild flowers
 Alistning the linnet aft wanders my Jean

 Tho rich is the breeze in their gay sunny valleys
 And cauld Caledonias blast on the wave
 Their sweetscented woodlands that skirt the proud palace
 What are theythe haunt of the Tyrant and Slave
 The Slaves spicy forests and goldbubbling fountains
 The brave Caledonian views wi disdain
 He wanders as free as the winds of his mountains
 Save Loves willing fettersthe chains of his Jean




Forlorn My Love No Comfort Near

 AirLet me in this ae night


 Forlorn my Love no comfort near
 Far far from thee I wander here
 Far far from thee the fate severe
 At which I most repine Love

 ChorusO wert thou Love but near me
 But near near near me
 How kindly thou wouldst cheer me
 And mingle sighs with mine Love

 Around me scowls a wintry sky
 Blasting each bud of hope and joy
 And shelter shade nor home have I
 Save in these arms of thine Love
 O wert thou c

 Cold alterd friendships cruel part
 To poison Fortunes ruthless dart
 Let me not break thy faithful heart
 And say that fate is mine Love
 O wert thou c

 But dreary tho the moments fleet
 O let me think we yet shall meet
 That only ray of solace sweet
 Can on thy Chloris shine Love
 O wert thou c




FragmentWhy Why Tell The Lover

 TuneCaledonian Hunts delight


 Why why tell thy lover

 Why why undeceive him
 And give all his hopes the lie

 Why why wouldst thou cruel
 Wake thy lover from his dream




The Braw Wooer

 TuneThe Lothian Lassie


 Last May a braw wooer cam doun the lang glen
 And sair wi his love he did deave me
 I said there was naething I hated like men
 The deuce gae wim to believe me believe me
 The deuce gae wim to believe me

 He spak o the darts in my bonie black een
 And vowd for my love he was diein
 I said he might die when he liked for Jean
 The Lord forgie me for liein for liein
 The Lord forgie me for liein

 A weelstocked mailen himsel for the laird
 And marriage affhand were his proffers
 I never loot on that I kennd it or card
 But thought I might hae waur offers waur offers
 But thought I might hae waur offers

 But what wad ye thinkin a fortnight or less
 The deil tak his taste to gae near her
 He up the Gateslack to my black cousin Bess
 Guess ye how the jad I could bear her could bear her
 Guess ye how the jad I could bear her

 But a the niest week as I petted wi care
 I gaed to the tryst o Dalgarnock
 But wha but my fine fickle wooer was there
 I glowrd as Id seen a warlock a warlock
 I glowrd as Id seen a warlock

 But owre my left shouther I gae him a blink
 Lest neibours might say I was saucy
 My wooer he caperd as hed been in drink
 And vowd I was his dear lassie dear lassie
 And vowd I was his dear lassie

 I spierd for my cousin fu couthy and sweet
 Gin she had recoverd her hearin
 And how her new shoon fit her auld schachlt feet
 But heavens how he fell a swearin a swearin
 But heavens how he fell a swearin

 He begged for gudesake I wad be his wife
 Or else I wad kill him wi sorrow
 So een to preserve the poor body in life
 I think I maun wed him tomorrow tomorrow
 I think I maun wed him tomorrow




This Is No My Ain Lassie

 TuneThis is no my house


 ChorusThis is no my ain lassie
 Fair tho the lassie be
 Weel ken I my ain lassie
 Kind love is in her ere

 I see a form I see a face
 Ye weel may wi the fairest place
 It wants to me the witching grace
 The kind love thats in her ee
 This is no my ain c

 Shes bonie blooming straight and tall
 And lang has had my heart in thrall
 And aye it charms my very saul
 The kind love thats in her ee
 This is no my ain c

 A thief sae pawkie is my Jean
 To steal a blink by a unseen
 But gleg as light are lovers een
 When kind love is in her ee
 This is no my ain c

 It may escape the courtly sparks
 It may escape the learned clerks
 But well the watching lover marks
 The kind love thats in her eye
 This is no my ain c




O Bonie Was Yon Rosy Brier

 O bonie was yon rosy brier
 That blooms sae far frae haunt o man
 And bonie she and ah how dear
 It shaded frae the eenin sun

 Yon rosebuds in the morning dew
 How pure amang the leaves sae green
 But purer was the lovers vow
 They witnessd in their shade yestreen

 All in its rude and prickly bower
 That crimson rose how sweet and fair
 But love is far a sweeter flower
 Amid lifes thorny path o care

 The pathless wild and wimpling burn
 Wi Chloris in my arms be mine
 And I the warld nor wish nor scorn
 Its joys and griefs alike resign




Song Inscribed To Alexander Cunningham

 Now spring has clad the grove in green
 And strewd the lea wi flowers
 The furrowd waving corn is seen
 Rejoice in fostering showers
 While ilka thing in nature join
 Their sorrows to forego
 O why thus all alone are mine
 The weary steps o woe

 The trout in yonder wimpling burn
 That glides a silver dart
 And safe beneath the shady thorn
 Defies the anglers art
 My life was ance that careless stream
 That wanton trout was I
 But Love wi unrelenting beam
 Has scorchd my fountains dry

 That little flowerets peaceful lot
 In yonder cliff that grows
 Which save the linnets flight I wot
 Nae ruder visit knows
 Was mine till Love has oer me past
 And blighted a my bloom
 And now beneath the withering blast
 My youth and joy consume

 The wakend lavrock warbling springs
 And climbs the early sky
 Winnowing blythe his dewy wings
 In mornings rosy eye
 As little reckd I sorrows power
 Until the flowery snare
 Owitching Love in luckless hour
 Made me the thrall o care

 O had my fate been Greenland snows
 Or Africs burning zone
 Wiman and nature leagued my foes
 So Peggy neer Id known
 The wretch whose doom is Hope nae mair
 What tongue his woes can tell
 Within whase bosom save Despair
 Nae kinder spirits dwell




O Thats The Lassie O My Heart

 TuneMorag


 O wat ye wha that loes me
 And has my heart akeeping
 O sweet is she that loes me
 As dews o summer weeping
 In tears the rosebuds steeping

 ChorusO thats the lassie o my heart
 My lassie ever dearer
 O shes the queen o womankind
 And neer a ane to peer her

 If thou shalt meet a lassie
 In grace and beauty charming
 That een thy chosen lassie
 Erewhile thy breast sae warming
 Had neer sic powers alarming
 O thats the lassie c

 If thou hadst heard her talking
 And thy attentions plighted
 That ilka body talking
 But her by thee is slighted
 And thou art all delighted
 O thats the lassie c

 If thou hast met this Fair One
 When frae her thou hast parted
 If every other Fair One
 But her thou hast deserted
 And thou art brokenhearted
 O thats the lassie o my heart
 My lassie ever dearer
 O thats the queen o womankind
 And neer a ane to peer her




Inscription

Written on the blank leaf of a copy of the last edition of my poems
presented to the Lady whom in so many fictitious reveries of passion but
with the most ardent sentiments of real friendship I have so often sung
under the name ofChloris1


 Tis Friendships pledge my young fair Friend
 Nor thou the gift refuse
 Nor with unwilling ear attend
 The moralising Muse

 Since thou in all thy youth and charms
 Must bid the world adieu
 A world gainst Peace in constant arms
 To join the Friendly Few

 Since thy gay morn of life oercast
 Chill came the tempests lour
 And neer Misfortunes eastern blast
 Did nip a fairer flower

 Since lifes gay scenes must charm no more
 Still much is left behind
 Still nobler wealth hast thou in store
 The comforts of the mind

 Thine is the selfapproving glow
 Of conscious Honours part
 And dearest gift of Heaven below
 Thine Friendships truest heart

 The joys refind of Sense and Taste
 With every Muse to rove
 And doubly were the Poet blest
 These joys could he improve

 Jockeys taen the parting kiss
 Oer the mountains he is gane
 And with him is a my bliss
 Nought but griefs with me remain
 Spare my Love ye winds that blaw
 Plashy sleets and beating rain
 Spare my Love thou feathry snaw
 Drifting oer the frozen plain

 When the shades of evening creep
 Oer the days fair gladsome ee
 Sound and safely may he sleep
 Sweetly blythe his waukening be
 He will think on her he loves
 Fondly hell repeat her name
 For whereer he distant roves
 Jockeys heart is still the same

The Dean Of Faculty

 A New Ballad
 TuneThe Dragon of Wantley


 Dire was the hate at old Harlaw
 That Scot to Scot did carry
 And dire the discord Langside saw
 For beauteous hapless Mary
 But Scot to Scot neer met so hot
 Or were more in fury seen Sir
 Than twixt Hal and Bob for the famous job
 Who should be the Facultys Dean Sir

 This Hal for genius wit and lore
 Among the first was numberd
 But pious Bob mid learnings store
 Commandment the tenth rememberd
 Yet simple Bob the victory got
 And wan his hearts desire
 Which shews that heaven can boil the pot
 Tho the devil piss in the fire

 Squire Hal besides had in this case
 Pretensions rather brassy
 For talents to deserve a place
 Are qualifications saucy
 So their worships of the Faculty
 Quite sick of merits rudeness
 Chose one who should owe it all dye see
 To their gratis grace and goodness

 As once on Pisgah purgd was the sight
 Of a son of Circumcision
 So may be on this Pisgah height
 Bobs purblind mental vision
 Nay Bobbys mouth may be opened yet
 Till for eloquence you hail him
 And swear that he has the angel met
 That met the ass of Balaam

 In your heretic sins may you live and die
 Ye heretic EightandTairty
 But accept ye sublime Majority
 My congratulations hearty
 With your honours as with a certain king
 In your servants this is striking
 The more incapacity they bring
 The more theyre to your liking




Epistle To Colonel De Peyster

 My honord Colonel deep I feel
 Your interest in the Poets weal
 Ah now sma heart hae I to speel
 The steep Parnassus
 Surrounded thus by bolus pill
 And potion glasses

 O what a canty world were it
 Would pain and care and sickness spare it
 And Fortune favour worth and merit
 As they deserve
 And aye rowth o roastbeef and claret
 Syne wha wad starve

 Dame Life tho fiction out may trick her
 And in paste gems and frippery deck her
 Oh flickering feeble and unsicker
 Ive found her still
 Aye wavering like the willowwicker
 Tween good and ill

 Then that curst carmagnole auld Satan
 Watches like baudrons by a ratton
 Our sinfu saul to get a claut on
 Wifelon ire
 Syne whip his tail yell neer cast saut on
 Hes aff like fire

 Ah Nick ah Nick it is na fair
 First showing us the tempting ware
 Bright wines and bonie lasses rare
 To put us daft
 Syne weave unseen thy spider snare
 O hells damned waft

 Poor Man the flie aft bizzes by
 And aft as chance he comes thee nigh
 Thy damnd auld elbow yeuks wijoy
 And hellish pleasure
 Already in thy fancys eye
 Thy sicker treasure

 Soon heels oer gowdie in he gangs
 And like a sheephead on a tangs
 Thy girning laugh enjoys his pangs
 And murdering wrestle
 As dangling in the wind he hangs
 A gibbets tassel

 But lest you think I am uncivil
 To plague you with this draunting drivel
 Abjuring a intentions evil
 I quat my pen
 The Lord preserve us frae the devil
 Amen Amen

 And een when this Beauty your bosom hath blest
 The brightest o Beauty may cloy when possessd
 But the sweet yellow darlings wi Geordie impressd
 The langer ye hae them the mair theyre carest

Complimentary Versicles To Jessie Lewars

 The Toast

 Fill me with the rosy wine
 Call a toast a toast divine
 Giveth me Poets darling flame
 Lovely Jessie be her name
 Then thou mayest freely boast
 Thou hast given a peerless toast


 The Menagerie

 Talk not to me of savages
 From Africs burning sun
 No savage eer could rend my heart
 As Jessie thou hast done
 But Jessies lovely hand in mine
 A mutual faith to plight
 Not even to view the heavenly choir
 Would be so blest a sight


 Jessies illness

 Say sages whats the charm on earth
 Can turn Deaths dart aside
 It is not purity and worth
 Else Jessie had not died


 On Her Recovery

 But rarely seen since Natures birth
 The natives of the sky
 Yet still one seraphs left on earth
 For Jessie did not die

 In mine lass in mine lass
 And swear on thy white hand lass
 That thou wilt be my ain

 A slave to Loves unbounded sway
 He aft has wrought me meikle wae
 But now he is my deadly fae
 Unless thou be my ain
 O lay thy loof c

 Theres mony a lass has broke my rest
 That for a blink I hae loed best
 But thou art Queen within my breast
 For ever to remain
 O lay thy loof c

 But why urge the tender confession
 Gainst Fortunes fell cruel decreeJessy

O Wert Thou In The Cauld Blast

 O wert thou in the cauld blast
 On yonder lea on yonder lea
 My plaidie to the angry airt
 Id shelter thee Id shelter thee
 Or did Misfortunes bitter storms
 Around thee blaw around thee blaw
 Thy bield should be my bosom
 To share it a to share it a

 Or were I in the wildest waste
 Sae black and bare sae black and bare
 The desert were a Paradise
 If thou wert there if thou wert there
 Or were I Monarch o the globe
 Wi thee to reign wi thee to reign
 The brightest jewel in my Crown
 Wad be my Queen wad be my Queen




Inscription To Miss Jessy Lewars

On a copy of the Scots Musical Museum in four volumes presented to her by
Burns 1

 Thine be the volumes Jessy fair
 And with them take the Poets prayer
 That Fate may in her fairest page
 With evry kindliest best presage
 Of future bliss enroll thy name
 With native worth and spotless fame
 And wakeful caution still aware
 Of illbut chief Mans felon snare

 All blameless joys on earth we find
 And all the treasures of the mind
 These be thy guardian and reward
 So prays thy faithful friend the Bard

 Dumfries June 26 1769

 Footnote 1 Written for music played by Miss Lewars who
 nursed him in his last illness




Fairest Maid On Devon Banks

 TuneRothiemurchie


 ChorusFairest maid on Devon banks
 Crystal Devon winding Devon
 Wilt thou lay that frown aside
 And smile as thou wert wont to do

 Full well thou knowst I love thee dear
 Couldst thou to malice lend an ear
 O did not Love exclaim Forbear
 Nor use a faithful lover so
 Fairest maid c

 Then come thou fairest of the fair
 Those wonted smiles O let me share
 And by thy beauteous self I swear
 No love but thine my heart shall know
 Fairest maid c
