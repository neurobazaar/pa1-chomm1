SCENE
Athens and a wood near it


ACT I SCENE I
Athens The palace of THESEUS

Enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA PHILOSTRATE and ATTENDANTS

 THESEUS Now fair Hippolyta our nuptial hour
 Draws on apace four happy days bring in
 Another moon but O methinks how slow
 This old moon wanes She lingers my desires
 Like to a stepdame or a dowager
 Long withering out a young mans revenue
 HIPPOLYTA Four days will quickly steep themselves in night
 Four nights will quickly dream away the time
 And then the moon like to a silver bow
 Newbent in heaven shall behold the night
 Of our solemnities
 THESEUS Go Philostrate
 Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments
 Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth
 Turn melancholy forth to funerals
 The pale companion is not for our pomp Exit PHILOSTRATE
 Hippolyta I wood thee with my sword
 And won thy love doing thee injuries
 But I will wed thee in another key
 With pomp with triumph and with revelling

 Enter EGEUS and his daughter HERMIA LYSANDER
 and DEMETRIUS

 EGEUS Happy be Theseus our renowned Duke
 THESEUS Thanks good Egeus whats the news with thee
 EGEUS Full of vexation come I with complaint
 Against my child my daughter Hermia
 Stand forth Demetrius My noble lord
 This man hath my consent to marry her
 Stand forth Lysander And my gracious Duke
 This man hath bewitchd the bosom of my child
 Thou thou Lysander thou hast given her rhymes
 And interchangd lovetokens with my child
 Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
 With feigning voice verses of feigning love
 And stoln the impression of her fantasy
 With bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits
 Knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers
 Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth
 With cunning hast thou filchd my daughters heart
 Turnd her obedience which is due to me
 To stubborn harshness And my gracious Duke
 Be it so she will not here before your Grace
 Consent to marry with Demetrius
 I beg the ancient privilege of Athens
 As she is mine I may dispose of her
 Which shall be either to this gentleman
 Or to her death according to our law
 Immediately provided in that case
 THESEUS What say you Hermia Be advisd fair maid
 To you your father should be as a god
 One that composd your beauties yea and one
 To whom you are but as a form in wax
 By him imprinted and within his power
 To leave the figure or disfigure it
 Demetrius is a worthy gentleman
 HERMIA So is Lysander
 THESEUS In himself he is
 But in this kind wanting your fathers voice
 The other must be held the worthier
 HERMIA I would my father lookd but with my eyes
 THESEUS Rather your eyes must with his judgment look
 HERMIA I do entreat your Grace to pardon me
 I know not by what power I am made bold
 Nor how it may concern my modesty
 In such a presence here to plead my thoughts
 But I beseech your Grace that I may know
 The worst that may befall me in this case
 If I refuse to wed Demetrius
 THESEUS Either to die the death or to abjure
 For ever the society of men
 Therefore fair Hermia question your desires
 Know of your youth examine well your blood
 Whether if you yield not to your fathers choice
 You can endure the livery of a nun
 For aye to be shady cloister mewd
 To live a barren sister all your life
 Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
 Thriceblessed they that master so their blood
 To undergo such maiden pilgrimage
 But earthlier happy is the rose distilld
 Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
 Grows lives and dies in single blessedness
 HERMIA So will I grow so live so die my lord
 Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
 Unto his lordship whose unwished yoke
 My soul consents not to give sovereignty
 THESEUS Take time to pause and by the next new moon
 The sealingday betwixt my love and me
 For everlasting bond of fellowship
 Upon that day either prepare to die
 For disobedience to your fathers will
 Or else to wed Demetrius as he would
 Or on Dianas altar to protest
 For aye austerity and single life
 DEMETRIUS Relent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield
 Thy crazed title to my certain right
 LYSANDER You have her fathers love Demetrius
 Let me have Hermias do you marry him
 EGEUS Scornful Lysander true he hath my love
 And what is mine my love shall render him
 And she is mine and all my right of her
 I do estate unto Demetrius
 LYSANDER I am my lord as well derivd as he
 As well possessd my love is more than his
 My fortunes every way as fairly rankd
 If not with vantage as Demetrius
 And which is more than all these boasts can be
 I am belovd of beauteous Hermia
 Why should not I then prosecute my right
 Demetrius Ill avouch it to his head
 Made love to Nedars daughter Helena
 And won her soul and she sweet lady dotes
 Devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry
 Upon this spotted and inconstant man
 THESEUS I must confess that I have heard so much
 And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof
 But being overfull of selfaffairs
 My mind did lose it But Demetrius come
 And come Egeus you shall go with me
 I have some private schooling for you both
 For you fair Hermia look you arm yourself
 To fit your fancies to your fathers will
 Or else the law of Athens yields you up
 Which by no means we may extenuate
 To death or to a vow of single life
 Come my Hippolyta what cheer my love
 Demetrius and Egeus go along
 I must employ you in some business
 Against our nuptial and confer with you
 Of something nearly that concerns yourselves
 EGEUS With duty and desire we follow you
 Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA
 LYSANDER How now my love Why is your cheek so pale
 How chance the roses there do fade so fast
 HERMIA Belike for want of rain which I could well
 Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes
 LYSANDER Ay me for aught that I could ever read
 Could ever hear by tale or history
 The course of true love never did run smooth
 But either it was different in blood
 HERMIA O cross too high to be enthralld to low
 LYSANDER Or else misgraffed in respect of years
 HERMIA O spite too old to be engagd to young
 LYSANDER Or else it stood upon the choice of friends
 HERMIA O hell to choose love by anothers eyes
 LYSANDER Or if there were a sympathy in choice
 War death or sickness did lay siege to it
 Making it momentary as a sound
 Swift as a shadow short as any dream
 Brief as the lightning in the collied night
 That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth
 And ere a man hath power to say Behold
 The jaws of darkness do devour it up
 So quick bright things come to confusion
 HERMIA If then true lovers have ever crossd
 It stands as an edict in destiny
 Then let us teach our trial patience
 Because it is a customary cross
 As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs
 Wishes and tears poor Fancys followers
 LYSANDER A good persuasion therefore hear me Hermia
 I have a widow aunt a dowager
 Of great revenue and she hath no child
 From Athens is her house remote seven leagues
 And she respects me as her only son
 There gentle Hermia may I marry thee
 And to that place the sharp Athenian law
 Cannot pursue us If thou lovest me then
 Steal forth thy fathers house tomorrow night
 And in the wood a league without the town
 Where I did meet thee once with Helena
 To do observance to a morn of May
 There will I stay for thee
 HERMIA My good Lysander
 I swear to thee by Cupids strongest bow
 By his best arrow with the golden head
 By the simplicity of Venus doves
 By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves
 And by that fire which burnd the Carthage Queen
 When the false Troyan under sail was seen
 By all the vows that ever men have broke
 In number more than ever women spoke
 In that same place thou hast appointed me
 Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee
 LYSANDER Keep promise love Look here comes Helena

 Enter HELENA

 HERMIA God speed fair Helena Whither away
 HELENA Call you me fair That fair again unsay
 Demetrius loves your fair O happy fair
 Your eyes are lodestars and your tongues sweet air
 More tuneable than lark to shepherds ear
 When wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
 Sickness is catching O were favour so
 Yours would I catch fair Hermia ere I go
 My ear should catch your voice my eye your eye
 My tongue should catch your tongues sweet melody
 Were the world mine Demetrius being bated
 The rest Id give to be to you translated
 O teach me how you look and with what art
 You sway the motion of Demetrius heart
 HERMIA I frown upon him yet he loves me still
 HELENA O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
 HERMIA I give him curses yet he gives me love
 HELENA O that my prayers could such affection move
 HERMIA The more I hate the more he follows me
 HELENA The more I love the more he hateth me
 HERMIA His folly Helena is no fault of mine
 HELENA None but your beauty would that fault were mine
 HERMIA Take comfort he no more shall see my face
 Lysander and myself will fly this place
 Before the time I did Lysander see
 Seemd Athens as a paradise to me
 O then what graces in my love do dwell
 That he hath turnd a heaven unto a hell
 LYSANDER Helen to you our minds we will unfold
 Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold
 Her silver visage in the watry glass
 Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
 A time that lovers flights doth still conceal
 Through Athens gates have we devisd to steal
 HERMIA And in the wood where often you and I
 Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie
 Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet
 There my Lysander and myself shall meet
 And thence from Athens turn away our eyes
 To seek new friends and stranger companies
 Farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us
 And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius
 Keep word Lysander we must starve our sight
 From lovers food till morrow deep midnight
 LYSANDER I will my Hermia Exit HERMIA Helena adieu
 As you on him Demetrius dote on you Exit
 HELENA How happy some oer other some can be
 Through Athens I am thought as fair as she
 But what of that Demetrius thinks not so
 He will not know what all but he do know
 And as he errs doting on Hermias eyes
 So I admiring of his qualities
 Things base and vile holding no quantity
 Love can transpose to form and dignity
 Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
 And therefore is wingd Cupid painted blind
 Nor hath Loves mind of any judgment taste
 Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
 And therefore is Love said to be a child
 Because in choice he is so oft beguild
 As waggish boys in game themselves forswear
 So the boy Love is perjurd everywhere
 For ere Demetrius lookd on Hermias eyne
 He haild down oaths that he was only mine
 And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt
 So he dissolvd and showrs of oaths did melt
 I will go tell him of fair Hermias flight
 Then to the wood will he tomorrow night
 Pursue her and for this intelligence
 If I have thanks it is a dear expense
 But herein mean I to enrich my pain
 To have his sight thither and back again Exit

ACT II SCENE I
A wood near Athens

Enter a FAIRY at One door and PUCK at another

 PUCK How now spirit whither wander you
 FAIRY Over hill over dale
 Thorough bush through brier
 Over park over pale
 Thorough flood through fire
 I do wander every where
 Swifter than the moons sphere
 And I serve the Fairy Queen
 To dew her orbs upon the green
 The cowslips tall her pensioners be
 In their gold coats spots you see
 Those be rubies fairy favours
 In those freckles live their savours

 I must go seek some dewdrops here
 And hang a pearl in every cowslips ear
 Farewell thou lob of spirits Ill be gone
 Our Queen and all her elves come here anon
 PUCK The King doth keep his revels here tonight
 Take heed the Queen come not within his sight
 For Oberon is passing fell and wrath
 Because that she as her attendant hath
 A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king
 She never had so sweet a changeling
 And jealous Oberon would have the child
 Knight of his train to trace the forests wild
 But she perforce withholds the loved boy
 Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
 And now they never meet in grove or green
 By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
 But they do square that all their elves for fear
 Creep into acorn cups and hide them there
 FAIRY Either I mistake your shape and making quite
 Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
 Calld Robin Goodfellow Are not you he
 That frights the maidens of the villagery
 Skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern
 And bootless make the breathless housewife churn
 And sometime make the drink to bear no barm
 Mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm
 Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck
 You do their work and they shall have good luck
 Are not you he
 PUCK Thou speakest aright
 I am that merry wanderer of the night
 I jest to Oberon and make him smile
 When I a fat and beanfed horse beguile
 Neighing in likeness of a filly foal
 And sometime lurk I in a gossips bowl
 In very likeness of a roasted crab
 And when she drinks against her lips I bob
 And on her withered dewlap pour the ale
 The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
 Sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me
 Then slip I from her bum down topples she
 And tailor cries and falls into a cough
 And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh
 And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
 A merrier hour was never wasted there
 But room fairy here comes Oberon
 FAIRY And here my mistress Would that he were gone

 Enter OBERON at one door with his TRAIN and TITANIA
 at another with hers

 OBERON Ill met by moonlight proud Titania
 TITANIA What jealous Oberon Fairies skip hence
 I have forsworn his bed and company
 OBERON Tarry rash wanton am not I thy lord
 TITANIA Then I must be thy lady but I know
 When thou hast stolen away from fairy land
 And in the shape of Corin sat all day
 Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
 To amorous Phillida Why art thou here
 Come from the farthest steep of India
 But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon
 Your buskind mistress and your warrior love
 To Theseus must be wedded and you come
 To give their bed joy and prosperity
 OBERON How canst thou thus for shame Titania
 Glance at my credit with Hippolyta
 Knowing I know thy love to Theseus
 Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
 From Perigouna whom he ravished
 And make him with fair Aegles break his faith
 With Ariadne and Antiopa
 TITANIA These are the forgeries of jealousy
 And never since the middle summers spring
 Met we on hill in dale forest or mead
 By paved fountain or by rushy brook
 Or in the beached margent of the sea
 To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
 But with thy brawls thou hast disturbd our sport
 Therefore the winds piping to us in vain
 As in revenge have suckd up from the sea
 Contagious fogs which falling in the land
 Hath every pelting river made so proud
 That they have overborne their continents
 The ox hath therefore stretchd his yoke in vain
 The ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn
 Hath rotted ere his youth attaind a beard
 The fold stands empty in the drowned field
 And crows are fatted with the murrion flock
 The nine mens morris is filld up with mud
 And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
 For lack of tread are undistinguishable
 The human mortals want their winter here
 No night is now with hymn or carol blest
 Therefore the moon the governess of floods
 Pale in her anger washes all the air
 That rheumatic diseases do abound
 And through this distemperature we see
 The seasons alter hoaryheaded frosts
 Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
 And on old Hiems thin and icy crown
 An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
 Is as in mockery set The spring the summer
 The childing autumn angry winter change
 Their wonted liveries and the mazed world
 By their increase now knows not which is which
 And this same progeny of evils comes
 From our debate from our dissension
 We are their parents and original
 OBERON Do you amend it then it lies in you
 Why should Titania cross her Oberon
 I do but beg a little changeling boy
 To be my henchman
 TITANIA Set your heart at rest
 The fairy land buys not the child of me
 His mother was a votress of my order
 And in the spiced Indian air by night
 Full often hath she gossipd by my side
 And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands
 Marking th embarked traders on the flood
 When we have laughd to see the sails conceive
 And grow bigbellied with the wanton wind
 Which she with pretty and with swimming gait
 Following her womb then rich with my young squire
 Would imitate and sail upon the land
 To fetch me trifles and return again
 As from a voyage rich with merchandise
 But she being mortal of that boy did die
 And for her sake do I rear up her boy
 And for her sake I will not part with him
 OBERON How long within this wood intend you stay
 TITANIA Perchance till after Theseus weddingday
 If you will patiently dance in our round
 And see our moonlight revels go with us
 If not shun me and I will spare your haunts
 OBERON Give me that boy and I will go with thee
 TITANIA Not for thy fairy kingdom Fairies away
 We shall chide downright if I longer stay
 Exit TITANIA with her train
 OBERON Well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
 Till I torment thee for this injury
 My gentle Puck come hither Thou remembrest
 Since once I sat upon a promontory
 And heard a mermaid on a dolphins back
 Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
 That the rude sea grew civil at her song
 And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
 To hear the seamaids music
 PUCK I remember
 OBERON That very time I saw but thou couldst not
 Flying between the cold moon and the earth
 Cupid all armd a certain aim he took
 At a fair vestal throned by the west
 And loosd his loveshaft smartly from his bow
 As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
 But I might see young Cupids fiery shaft
 Quenchd in the chaste beams of the watry moon
 And the imperial votress passed on
 In maiden meditation fancyfree
 Yet markd I where the bolt of Cupid fell
 It fell upon a little western flower
 Before milkwhite now purple with loves wound
 And maidens call it Loveinidleness
 Fetch me that flowr the herb I showed thee once
 The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
 Will make or man or woman madly dote
 Upon the next live creature that it sees
 Fetch me this herb and be thou here again
 Ere the leviathan can swim a league
 PUCK Ill put a girdle round about the earth
 In forty minutes Exit PUCK
 OBERON Having once this juice
 Ill watch Titania when she is asleep
 And drop the liquor of it in her eyes
 The next thing then she waking looks upon
 Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull
 On meddling monkey or on busy ape
 She shall pursue it with the soul of love
 And ere I take this charm from off her sight
 As I can take it with another herb
 Ill make her render up her page to me
 But who comes here I am invisible
 And I will overhear their conference

 Enter DEMETRIUS HELENA following him

 DEMETRIUS I love thee not therefore pursue me not
 Where is Lysander and fair Hermia
 The one Ill slay the other slayeth me
 Thou toldst me they were stoln unto this wood
 And here am I and wood within this wood
 Because I cannot meet my Hermia
 Hence get thee gone and follow me no more
 HELENA You draw me you hardhearted adamant
 But yet you draw not iron for my heart
 Is true as steel Leave you your power to draw
 And I shall have no power to follow you
 DEMETRIUS Do I entice you Do I speak you fair
 Or rather do I not in plainest truth
 Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you
 HELENA And even for that do I love you the more
 I am your spaniel and Demetrius
 The more you beat me I will fawn on you
 Use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me
 Neglect me lose me only give me leave
 Unworthy as I am to follow you
 What worser place can I beg in your love
 And yet a place of high respect with me
 Than to be used as you use your dog
 DEMETRIUS Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit
 For I am sick when I do look on thee
 HELENA And I am sick when I look not on you
 DEMETRIUS You do impeach your modesty too much
 To leave the city and commit yourself
 Into the hands of one that loves you not
 To trust the opportunity of night
 And the ill counsel of a desert place
 With the rich worth of your virginity
 HELENA Your virtue is my privilege for that
 It is not night when I do see your face
 Therefore I think I am not in the night
 Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company
 For you in my respect are all the world
 Then how can it be said I am alone
 When all the world is here to look on me
 DEMETRIUS Ill run from thee and hide me in the brakes
 And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
 HELENA The wildest hath not such a heart as you
 Run when you will the story shall be changd
 Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase
 The dove pursues the griffin the mild hind
 Makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed
 When cowardice pursues and valour flies
 DEMETRIUS I will not stay thy questions let me go
 Or if thou follow me do not believe
 But I shall do thee mischief in the wood
 HELENA Ay in the temple in the town the field
 You do me mischief Fie Demetrius
 Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
 We cannot fight for love as men may do
 We should be wood and were not made to woo
 Exit DEMETRIUS
 Ill follow thee and make a heaven of hell
 To die upon the hand I love so well Exit HELENA
 OBERON Fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove
 Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love

 Reenter PUCK

 Hast thou the flower there Welcome wanderer
 PUCK Ay there it is
 OBERON I pray thee give it me
 I know a bank where the wild thyme blows
 Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows
 Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine
 With sweet muskroses and with eglantine
 There sleeps Titania sometime of the night
 Lulld in these flowers with dances and delight
 And there the snake throws her enamelld skin
 Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
 And with the juice of this Ill streak her eyes
 And make her full of hateful fantasies
 Take thou some of it and seek through this grove
 A sweet Athenian lady is in love
 With a disdainful youth anoint his eyes
 But do it when the next thing he espies
 May be the lady Thou shalt know the man
 By the Athenian garments he hath on
 Effect it with some care that he may prove
 More fond on her than she upon her love
 And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
 PUCK Fear not my lord your servant shall do so Exeunt




SCENE II
Another part of the wood

Enter TITANIA with her train

 TITANIA Come now a roundel and a fairy song
 Then for the third part of a minute hence
 Some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds
 Some war with reremice for their leathern wings
 To make my small elves coats and some keep back
 The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
 At our quaint spirits Sing me now asleep
 Then to your offices and let me rest

 The FAIRIES Sing

 FIRST FAIRY You spotted snakes with double tongue
 Thorny hedgehogs be not seen
 Newts and blindworms do no wrong
 Come not near our fairy Queen
 CHORUS Philomel with melody
 Sing in our sweet lullaby
 Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
 Never harm
 Nor spell nor charm
 Come our lovely lady nigh
 So good night with lullaby
 SECOND FAIRY Weaving spiders come not here
 Hence you longleggd spinners hence
 Beetles black approach not near
 Worm nor snail do no offence
 CHORUS Philomel with melody etc TITANIA sleeps
 FIRST FAIRY Hence away now all is well
 One aloof stand sentinel Exeunt FAIRIES

 Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIAS eyelids

 OBERON What thou seest when thou dost wake
 Do it for thy truelove take
 Love and languish for his sake
 Be it ounce or cat or bear
 Pard or boar with bristled hair
 In thy eye that shall appear
 When thou wakst it is thy dear
 Wake when some vile thing is near Exit

 Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA

 LYSANDER Fair love you faint with wandring in the wood
 And to speak troth I have forgot our way
 Well rest us Hermia if you think it good
 And tarry for the comfort of the day
 HERMIA Be it so Lysander find you out a bed
 For I upon this bank will rest my head
 LYSANDER One turf shall serve as pillow for us both
 One heart one bed two bosoms and one troth
 HERMIA Nay good Lysander for my sake my dear
 Lie further off yet do not lie so near
 LYSANDER O take the sense sweet of my innocence
 Love takes the meaning in loves conference
 I mean that my heart unto yours is knit
 So that but one heart we can make of it
 Two bosoms interchained with an oath
 So then two bosoms and a single troth
 Then by your side no bedroom me deny
 For lying so Hermia I do not lie
 HERMIA Lysander riddles very prettily
 Now much beshrew my manners and my pride
 If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied
 But gentle friend for love and courtesy
 Lie further off in human modesty
 Such separation as may well be said
 Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid
 So far be distant and good night sweet friend
 Thy love neer alter till thy sweet life end
 LYSANDER Amen amen to that fair prayer say I
 And then end life when I end loyalty
 Here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest
 HERMIA With half that wish the wishers eyes be pressd
 They sleep

 Enter PUCK

 PUCK Through the forest have I gone
 But Athenian found I none
 On whose eyes I might approve
 This flowers force in stirring love
 Night and silence Who is here
 Weeds of Athens he doth wear
 This is he my master said
 Despised the Athenian maid
 And here the maiden sleeping sound
 On the dank and dirty ground
 Pretty soul she durst not lie
 Near this lacklove this killcourtesy
 Churl upon thy eyes I throw
 All the power this charm doth owe
 When thou wakst let love forbid
 Sleep his seat on thy eyelid
 So awake when I am gone
 For I must now to Oberon Exit

 Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA running

 HELENA Stay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius
 DEMETRIUS I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
 HELENA O wilt thou darkling leave me Do not so
 DEMETRIUS Stay on thy peril I alone will go Exit
 HELENA O I am out of breath in this fond chase
 The more my prayer the lesser is my grace
 Happy is Hermia wheresoeer she lies
 For she hath blessed and attractive eyes
 How came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears
 If so my eyes are oftner washd than hers
 No no I am as ugly as a bear
 For beasts that meet me run away for fear
 Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
 Do as a monster fly my presence thus
 What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
 Made me compare with Hermias sphery eyne
 But who is here Lysander on the ground
 Dead or asleep I see no blood no wound
 Lysander if you live good sir awake
 LYSANDER Waking And run through fire I will for thy sweet
sake
 Transparent Helena Nature shows art
 That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
 Where is Demetrius O how fit a word
 Is that vile name to perish on my sword
 HELENA Do not say so Lysander say not so
 What though he love your Hermia Lord what though
 Yet Hermia still loves you then be content
 LYSANDER Content with Hermia No I do repent
 The tedious minutes I with her have spent
 Not Hermia but Helena I love
 Who will not change a raven for a dove
 The will of man is by his reason swayd
 And reason says you are the worthier maid
 Things growing are not ripe until their season
 So I being young till now ripe not to reason
 And touching now the point of human skill
 Reason becomes the marshal to my will
 And leads me to your eyes where I oerlook
 Loves stories written in Loves richest book
 HELENA Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born
 When at your hands did I deserve this scorn
 Ist not enough ist not enough young man
 That I did never no nor never can
 Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius eye
 But you must flout my insufficiency
 Good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do
 In such disdainful manner me to woo
 But fare you well perforce I must confess
 I thought you lord of more true gentleness
 O that a lady of one man refusd
 Should of another therefore be abusd Exit
 LYSANDER She sees not Hermia Hermia sleep thou there
 And never mayst thou come Lysander near
 For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
 The deepest loathing to the stomach brings
 Or as the heresies that men do leave
 Are hated most of those they did deceive
 So thou my surfeit and my heresy
 Of all be hated but the most of me
 And all my powers address your love and might
 To honour Helen and to be her knight Exit
 HERMIA Starting Help me Lysander help me do thy best
 To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast
 Ay me for pity What a dream was here
 Lysander look how I do quake with fear
 Methought a serpent eat my heart away
 And you sat smiling at his cruel prey
 Lysander What removd Lysander lord
 What out of hearing gone No sound no word
 Alack where are you Speak an if you hear
 Speak of all loves I swoon almost with fear
 No Then I well perceive you are not nigh
 Either death or you Ill find immediately Exit

 BOTTOM I see their knavery this is to make an ass of me to
 fright me if they could But I will not stir from this
place do
 what they can I will walk up and down here and will sing
that

 The ousel cock so black of hue
 With orangetawny bill
 The throstle with his note so true
 The wren with little quill

 TITANIA What angel wakes me from my flowry bed
 BOTTOM Sings
 The finch the sparrow and the lark
 The plainsong cuckoo grey
 Whose note full many a man doth mark
 And dares not answer nay
 for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird
 Who would give a bird the lie though he cry cuckoo never
so
 TITANIA I pray thee gentle mortal sing again
 Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note
 So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape
 And thy fair virtues force perforce doth move me
 On the first view to say to swear I love thee
 BOTTOM Methinks mistress you should have little reason for
that
 And yet to say the truth reason and love keep little
company
 together nowadays The more the pity that some honest
 neighbours will not make them friends Nay I can gleek upon
 occasion
 TITANIA Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
 BOTTOM Not so neither but if I had wit enough to get out of
this
 wood I have enough to serve mine own turn
 TITANIA Out of this wood do not desire to go
 Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no
 I am a spirit of no common rate
 The summer still doth tend upon my state
 And I do love thee therefore go with me
 Ill give thee fairies to attend on thee
 And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep
 And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep
 And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
 That thou shalt like an airy spirit go
 Peaseblossom Cobweb Moth and Mustardseed

 Enter PEASEBLOSSOM COBWEB MOTH and MUSTARDSEED

 PEASEBLOSSOM Ready
 COBWEB And I
 MOTH And I
 MUSTARDSEED And I
 ALL Where shall we go
 TITANIA Be kind and courteous to this gentleman
 Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes
 Feed him with apricocks and dewberries
 With purple grapes green figs and mulberries
 The honey bags steal from the humblebees
 And for nighttapers crop their waxen thighs
 And light them at the fiery glowworms eyes
 To have my love to bed and to arise
 And pluck the wings from painted butterflies
 To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
 Nod to him elves and do him courtesies
 PEASEBLOSSOM Hail mortal
 COBWEB Hail
 MOTH Hail
 MUSTARDSEED Hail
 BOTTOM I cry your worships mercy heartily I beseech your
 worships name
 COBWEB Cobweb
 BOTTOM I shall desire you of more acquaintance good Master
 Cobweb If I cut my finger I shall make bold with you Your
 name honest gentleman

and
 to Master Peascod your father Good Master Peaseblossom I
shall
 desire you of more acquaintance too Your name I beseech

 MUSTARDSEED Mustardseed
 BOTTOM Good Master Mustardseed I know your patience well
That
 same cowardly giantlike oxbeef hath devourd many a
gentleman
 of your house I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes
water
 ere now I desire you of more acquaintance good Master
 Mustardseed
 TITANIA Come wait upon him lead him to my bower
 The moon methinks looks with a watry eye
 And when she weeps weeps every little flower
 Lamenting some enforced chastity
 Tie up my loves tongue bring him silently Exeunt




SCENE II
Another part of the wood

Enter OBERON

 OBERON I wonder if Titania be awakd
 Then what it was that next came in her eye
 Which she must dote on in extremity

 Enter PUCK

 Here comes my messenger How now mad spirit
 What nightrule now about this haunted grove
 PUCK My mistress with a monster is in love
 Near to her close and consecrated bower
 While she was in her dull and sleeping hour
 A crew of patches rude mechanicals
 That work for bread upon Athenian stalls
 Were met together to rehearse a play
 Intended for great Theseus nuptial day
 The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort
 Who Pyramus presented in their sport
 Forsook his scene and entred in a brake
 When I did him at this advantage take
 An asss nole I fixed on his head
 Anon his Thisby must be answered
 And forth my mimic comes When they him spy
 As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye
 Or russetpated choughs many in sort
 Rising and cawing at the guns report
 Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky
 So at his sight away his fellows fly
 And at our stamp here oer and oer one falls
 He murder cries and help from Athens calls
 Their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong
 Made senseless things begin to do them wrong
 For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch
 Some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch
 I led them on in this distracted fear
 And left sweet Pyramus translated there
 When in that moment so it came to pass
 Titania wakd and straightway lovd an ass
 OBERON This falls out better than I could devise
 But hast thou yet latchd the Athenians eyes
 With the lovejuice as I did bid thee do
 PUCK I took him sleeping that is finishd too
 And the Athenian woman by his side
 That when he wakd of force she must be eyd

 Enter DEMETRIUS and HERMIA

 OBERON Stand close this is the same Athenian
 PUCK This is the woman but not this the man
 DEMETRIUS O why rebuke you him that loves you so
 Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
 HERMIA Now I but chide but I should use thee worse
 For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse
 If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep
 Being oer shoes in blood plunge in the deep
 And kill me too
 The sun was not so true unto the day
 As he to me Would he have stolen away
 From sleeping Hermia Ill believe as soon
 This whole earth may be bord and that the moon
 May through the centre creep and so displease
 Her brothers noontide with th Antipodes
 It cannot be but thou hast murdred him
 So should a murderer look so dead so grim
 DEMETRIUS So should the murdered look and so should I
 Piercd through the heart with your stern cruelty
 Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear
 As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere
 HERMIA Whats this to my Lysander Where is he
 Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me
 DEMETRIUS I had rather give his carcass to my hounds
 HERMIA Out dog out cur Thou drivst me past the bounds
 Of maidens patience Hast thou slain him then
 Henceforth be never numbred among men
 O once tell true tell true even for my sake
 Durst thou have lookd upon him being awake
 And hast thou killd him sleeping O brave touch
 Could not a worm an adder do so much
 An adder did it for with doubler tongue
 Than thine thou serpent never adder stung
 DEMETRIUS You spend your passion on a misprisd mood
 I am not guilty of Lysanders blood
 Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell
 HERMIA I pray thee tell me then that he is well
 DEMETRIUS An if I could what should I get therefore
 HERMIA A privilege never to see me more
 And from thy hated presence part I so
 See me no more whether he be dead or no Exit
 DEMETRIUS There is no following her in this fierce vein
 Here therefore for a while I will remain
 So sorrows heaviness doth heavier grow
 For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
 Which now in some slight measure it will pay
 If for his tender here I make some stay Lies down
 OBERON What hast thou done Thou hast mistaken quite
 And laid the lovejuice on some trueloves sight
 Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
 Some true love turnd and not a false turnd true
 PUCK Then fate oerrules that one man holding troth
 A million fail confounding oath on oath
 OBERON About the wood go swifter than the wind
 And Helena of Athens look thou find
 All fancysick she is and pale of cheer
 With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear
 By some illusion see thou bring her here
 Ill charm his eyes against she do appear
 PUCK I go I go look how I go
 Swifter than arrow from the Tartars bow Exit
 OBERON Flower of this purple dye
 Hit with Cupids archery
 Sink in apple of his eye
 When his love he doth espy
 Let her shine as gloriously
 As the Venus of the sky
 When thou wakst if she be by
 Beg of her for remedy

 Reenter PUCK

 PUCK Captain of our fairy band
 Helena is here at hand
 And the youth mistook by me
 Pleading for a lovers fee
 Shall we their fond pageant see
 Lord what fools these mortals be
 OBERON Stand aside The noise they make
 Will cause Demetrius to awake
 PUCK Then will two at once woo one
 That must needs be sport alone
 And those things do best please me
 That befall prepostrously

 Enter LYSANDER and HELENA

 LYSANDER Why should you think that I should woo in scorn
 Scorn and derision never come in tears
 Look when I vow I weep and vows so born
 In their nativity all truth appears
 How can these things in me seem scorn to you
 Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
 HELENA You do advance your cunning more and more
 When truth kills truth O devilishholy fray
 These vows are Hermias Will you give her oer
 Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh
 Your vows to her and me put in two scales
 Will even weigh and both as light as tales
 LYSANDER I had no judgment when to her I swore
 HELENA Nor none in my mind now you give her oer
 LYSANDER Demetrius loves her and he loves not you
 DEMETRIUS Awaking O Helen goddess nymph perfect divine
 To what my love shall I compare thine eyne
 Crystal is muddy O how ripe in show
 Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
 That pure congealed white high Taurus snow
 Fannd with the eastern wind turns to a crow
 When thou holdst up thy hand O let me kiss
 This princess of pure white this seal of bliss
 HELENA O spite O hell I see you all are bent
 To set against me for your merriment
 If you were civil and knew courtesy
 You would not do me thus much injury
 Can you not hate me as I know you do
 But you must join in souls to mock me too
 If you were men as men you are in show
 You would not use a gentle lady so
 To vow and swear and superpraise my parts
 When I am sure you hate me with your hearts
 You both are rivals and love Hermia
 And now both rivals to mock Helena
 A trim exploit a manly enterprise
 To conjure tears up in a poor maids eyes
 With your derision None of noble sort
 Would so offend a virgin and extort
 A poor souls patience all to make you sport
 LYSANDER You are unkind Demetrius be not so
 For you love Hermia This you know I know
 And here with all good will with all my heart
 In Hermias love I yield you up my part
 And yours of Helena to me bequeath
 Whom I do love and will do till my death
 HELENA Never did mockers waste more idle breath
 DEMETRIUS Lysander keep thy Hermia I will none
 If eer I lovd her all that love is gone
 My heart to her but as guestwise sojournd
 And now to Helen is it home returnd
 There to remain
 LYSANDER Helen it is not so
 DEMETRIUS Disparage not the faith thou dost not know
 Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear
 Look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear

 Enter HERMIA

 HERMIA Dark night that from the eye his function takes
 The ear more quick of apprehension makes
 Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense
 It pays the hearing double recompense
 Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found
 Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound
 But why unkindly didst thou leave me so
 LYSANDER Why should he stay whom love doth press to go
 HERMIA What love could press Lysander from my side
 LYSANDER Lysanders love that would not let him bide
 Fair Helena who more engilds the night
 Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light
 Why seekst thou me Could not this make thee know
 The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so
 HERMIA You speak not as you think it cannot be
 HELENA Lo she is one of this confederacy
 Now I perceive they have conjoind all three
 To fashion this false sport in spite of me
 Injurious Hermia most ungrateful maid
 Have you conspird have you with these contrivd
 To bait me with this foul derision
 Is all the counsel that we two have shard
 The sisters vows the hours that we have spent
 When we have chid the hastyfooted time
 For parting us O is all forgot
 All schooldays friendship childhood innocence
 We Hermia like two artificial gods
 Have with our needles created both one flower
 Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion
 Both warbling of one song both in one key
 As if our hands our sides voices and minds
 Had been incorporate So we grew together
 Like to a double cherry seeming parted
 But yet an union in partition
 Two lovely berries moulded on one stem
 So with two seeming bodies but one heart
 Two of the first like coats in heraldry
 Due but to one and crowned with one crest
 And will you rent our ancient love asunder
 To join with men in scorning your poor friend
 It is not friendly tis not maidenly
 Our sex as well as I may chide you for it
 Though I alone do feel the injury
 HERMIA I am amazed at your passionate words
 I scorn you not it seems that you scorn me
 HELENA Have you not set Lysander as in scorn
 To follow me and praise my eyes and face
 And made your other love Demetrius
 Who even but now did spurn me with his foot
 To call me goddess nymph divine and rare
 Precious celestial Wherefore speaks he this
 To her he hates And wherefore doth Lysander
 Deny your love so rich within his soul
 And tender me forsooth affection
 But by your setting on by your consent
 What though I be not so in grace as you
 So hung upon with love so fortunate
 But miserable most to love unlovd
 This you should pity rather than despise
 HERMIA I understand not what you mean by this
 HELENA Ay do persever counterfeit sad looks
 Make mouths upon me when I turn my back
 Wink each at other hold the sweet jest up
 This sport well carried shall be chronicled
 If you have any pity grace or manners
 You would not make me such an argument
 But fare ye well tis partly my own fault
 Which death or absence soon shall remedy
 LYSANDER Stay gentle Helena hear my excuse
 My love my life my soul fair Helena
 HELENA O excellent
 HERMIA Sweet do not scorn her so
 DEMETRIUS If she cannot entreat I can compel
 LYSANDER Thou canst compel no more than she entreat
 Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
 Helen I love thee by my life I do
 I swear by that which I will lose for thee
 To prove him false that says I love thee not
 DEMETRIUS I say I love thee more than he can do
 LYSANDER If thou say so withdraw and prove it too
 DEMETRIUS Quick come
 HERMIA Lysander whereto tends all this
 LYSANDER Away you Ethiope
 DEMETRIUS No no he will
 Seem to break loose take on as you would follow
 But yet come not You are a tame man go
 LYSANDER Hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose
 Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent
 HERMIA Why are you grown so rude What change is this
 Sweet love
 LYSANDER Thy love Out tawny Tartar out
 Out loathed medcine O hated potion hence
 HERMIA Do you not jest
 HELENA Yes sooth and so do you
 LYSANDER Demetrius I will keep my word with thee
 DEMETRIUS I would I had your bond for I perceive
 A weak bond holds you Ill not trust your word
 LYSANDER What should I hurt her strike her kill her dead
 Although I hate her Ill not harm her so
 HERMIA What Can you do me greater harm than hate
 Hate me wherefore O me what news my love
 Am not I Hermia Are not you Lysander
 I am as fair now as I was erewhile
 Since night you lovd me yet since night you left me
 Why then you left me O the gods forbid
 In earnest shall I say
 LYSANDER Ay by my life
 And never did desire to see thee more
 Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt
 Be certain nothing truer tis no jest
 That I do hate thee and love Helena
 HERMIA O me you juggler you cankerblossom
 You thief of love What Have you come by night
 And stoln my loves heart from him
 HELENA Fine i faith
 Have you no modesty no maiden shame
 No touch of bashfulness What Will you tear
 Impatient answers from my gentle tongue
 Fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
 HERMIA Puppet why so Ay that way goes the game
 Now I perceive that she hath made compare
 Between our statures she hath urgd her height
 And with her personage her tall personage
 Her height forsooth she hath prevaild with him
 And are you grown so high in his esteem
 Because I am so dwarfish and so low
 How low am I thou painted maypole Speak
 How low am I I am not yet so low
 But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
 HELENA I pray you though you mock me gentlemen
 Let her not hurt me I was never curst
 I have no gift at all in shrewishness
 I am a right maid for my cowardice
 Let her not strike me You perhaps may think
 Because she is something lower than myself
 That I can match her
 HERMIA Lower hark again
 HELENA Good Hermia do not be so bitter with me
 I evermore did love you Hermia
 Did ever keep your counsels never wrongd you
 Save that in love unto Demetrius
 I told him of your stealth unto this wood
 He followed you for love I followed him
 But he hath chid me hence and threatned me
 To strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
 And now so you will let me quiet go
 To Athens will I bear my folly back
 And follow you no further Let me go
 You see how simple and how fond I am
 HERMIA Why get you gone Who ist that hinders you
 HELENA A foolish heart that I leave here behind
 HERMIA What with Lysander
 HELENA With Demetrius
 LYSANDER Be not afraid she shall not harm thee Helena
 DEMETRIUS No sir she shall not though you take her part
 HELENA O when she is angry she is keen and shrewd
 She was a vixen when she went to school
 And though she be but little she is fierce
 HERMIA Little again Nothing but low and little
 Why will you suffer her to flout me thus
 Let me come to her
 LYSANDER Get you gone you dwarf
 You minimus of hindring knotgrass made
 You bead you acorn
 DEMETRIUS You are too officious
 In her behalf that scorns your services
 Let her alone speak not of Helena
 Take not her part for if thou dost intend
 Never so little show of love to her
 Thou shalt aby it
 LYSANDER Now she holds me not
 Now follow if thou darst to try whose right
 Of thine or mine is most in Helena
 DEMETRIUS Follow Nay Ill go with thee cheek by jowl
 Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS
 HERMIA You mistress all this coil is long of you
 Nay go not back
 HELENA I will not trust you I
 Nor longer stay in your curst company
 Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
 My legs are longer though to run away Exit
 HERMIA I am amazd and know not what to say Exit
 OBERON This is thy negligence Still thou mistakst
 Or else committst thy knaveries wilfully
 PUCK Believe me king of shadows I mistook
 Did not you tell me I should know the man
 By the Athenian garments he had on
 And so far blameless proves my enterprise
 That I have nointed an Athenians eyes
 And so far am I glad it so did sort
 As this their jangling I esteem a sport
 OBERON Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight
 Hie therefore Robin overcast the night
 The starry welkin cover thou anon
 With drooping fog as black as Acheron
 And lead these testy rivals so astray
 As one come not within anothers way
 Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue
 Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong
 And sometime rail thou like Demetrius
 And from each other look thou lead them thus
 Till oer their brows deathcounterfeiting sleep
 With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
 Then crush this herb into Lysanders eye
 Whose liquor hath this virtuous property
 To take from thence all error with his might
 And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
 When they next wake all this derision
 Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision
 And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
 With league whose date till death shall never end
 Whiles I in this affair do thee employ
 Ill to my queen and beg her Indian boy
 And then I will her charmed eye release
 From monsters view and all things shall be peace
 PUCK My fairy lord this must be done with haste
 For nights swift dragons cut the clouds full fast
 And yonder shines Auroras harbinger
 At whose approach ghosts wandring here and there
 Troop home to churchyards Damned spirits all
 That in crossways and floods have burial
 Already to their wormy beds are gone
 For fear lest day should look their shames upon
 They wilfully themselves exild from light
 And must for aye consort with blackbrowd night
 OBERON But we are spirits of another sort
 I with the Mornings love have oft made sport
 And like a forester the groves may tread
 Even till the eastern gate all fiery red
 Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams
 Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
 But notwithstanding haste make no delay
 We may effect this business yet ere day Exit OBERON
 PUCK Up and down up and down
 I will lead them up and down
 I am feard in field and town
 Goblin lead them up and down
 Here comes one

 Enter LYSANDER

 LYSANDER Where art thou proud Demetrius Speak thou now
 PUCK Here villain drawn and ready Where art thou
 LYSANDER I will be with thee straight
 PUCK Follow me then
 To plainer ground Exit LYSANDER as following the voice

 Enter DEMETRIUS

 DEMETRIUS Lysander speak again
 Thou runaway thou coward art thou fled
 Speak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy head
 PUCK Thou coward art thou bragging to the stars
 Telling the bushes that thou lookst for wars
 And wilt not come Come recreant come thou child
 Ill whip thee with a rod He is defild
 That draws a sword on thee
 DEMETRIUS Yea art thou there
 PUCK Follow my voice well try no manhood here Exeunt

 Reenter LYSANDER

 LYSANDER He goes before me and still dares me on
 When I come where he calls then he is gone
 The villain is much lighter heeld than I
 I followed fast but faster he did fly
 That fallen am I in dark uneven way
 And here will rest me Lies down Come thou gentle day
 For if but once thou show me thy grey light
 Ill find Demetrius and revenge this spite Sleeps

 Reenter PUCK and DEMETRIUS

 PUCK Ho ho ho Coward why comst thou not
 DEMETRIUS Abide me if thou darst for well I wot
 Thou runst before me shifting every place
 And darst not stand nor look me in the face
 Where art thou now
 PUCK Come hither I am here
 DEMETRIUS Nay then thou mockst me Thou shalt buy this
dear
 If ever I thy face by daylight see
 Now go thy way Faintness constraineth me
 To measure out my length on this cold bed
 By days approach look to be visited
 Lies down and sleeps

 Enter HELENA

 HELENA O weary night O long and tedious night
 Abate thy hours Shine comforts from the east
 That I may back to Athens by daylight
 From these that my poor company detest
 And sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrows eye
 Steal me awhile from mine own company Sleeps
 PUCK Yet but three Come one more
 Two of both kinds makes up four
 Here she comes curst and sad
 Cupid is a knavish lad
 Thus to make poor females mad

 Enter HERMIA

 HERMIA Never so weary never so in woe
 Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers
 I can no further crawl no further go
 My legs can keep no pace with my desires
 Here will I rest me till the break of day
 Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray
 Lies down and sleeps
 PUCK On the ground
 Sleep sound
 Ill apply
 To your eye
 Gentle lover remedy
 Squeezing the juice on LYSANDERS eyes
 When thou wakst
 Thou takst
 True delight
 In the sight
 Of thy former ladys eye
 And the country proverb known
 That every man should take his own
 In your waking shall be shown
 Jack shall have Jill
 Nought shall go ill
 The man shall have his mare again and all shall be well
 Exit

 So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
 Gently entwist the female ivy so
 Enrings the barky fingers of the elm
 O how I love thee how I dote on thee They sleep

 Enter PUCK

 OBERON Advancing Welcome good Robin Seest thou this sweet
 sight
 Her dotage now I do begin to pity
 For meeting her of late behind the wood
 Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool
 I did upbraid her and fall out with her
 For she his hairy temples then had rounded
 With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
 And that same dew which sometime on the buds
 Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
 Stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes
 Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
 When I had at my pleasure taunted her
 And she in mild terms beggd my patience
 I then did ask of her her changeling child
 Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent
 To bear him to my bower in fairy land
 And now I have the boy I will undo
 This hateful imperfection of her eyes
 And gentle Puck take this transformed scalp
 From off the head of this Athenian swain
 That he awaking when the other do
 May all to Athens back again repair
 And think no more of this nights accidents
 But as the fierce vexation of a dream
 But first I will release the Fairy Queen
 Touching her eyes
 Be as thou wast wont to be
 See as thou was wont to see
 Dians bud oer Cupids flower
 Hath such force and blessed power
 Now my Titania wake you my sweet queen
 TITANIA My Oberon What visions have I seen
 Methought I was enamourd of an ass
 OBERON There lies your love
 TITANIA How came these things to pass
 O how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
 OBERON Silence awhile Robin take off this head
 Titania music call and strike more dead
 Than common sleep of all these five the sense
 TITANIA Music ho music such as charmeth sleep
 PUCK Now when thou wakst with thine own fools eyes peep
 OBERON Sound music Come my Queen take hands with me
 Music
 And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
 Now thou and I are new in amity
 And will tomorrow midnight solemnly
 Dance in Duke Theseus house triumphantly
 And bless it to all fair prosperity
 There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
 Wedded with Theseus an in jollity
 PUCK Fairy King attend and mark
 I do hear the morning lark
 OBERON Then my Queen in silence sad
 Trip we after nights shade
 We the globe can compass soon
 Swifter than the wandring moon
 TITANIA Come my lord and in our flight
 Tell me how it came this night
 That I sleeping here was found
 With these mortals on the ground Exeunt

 To the winding of horns enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA
 EGEUS and train

 THESEUS Go one of you find out the forester
 For now our observation is performd
 And since we have the vaward of the day
 My love shall hear the music of my hounds
 Uncouple in the western valley let them go
 Dispatch I say and find the forester Exit an ATTENDANT
 We will fair Queen up to the mountains top
 And mark the musical confusion
 Of hounds and echo in conjunction
 HIPPOLYTA I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
 When in a wood of Crete they bayd the bear
 With hounds of Sparta never did I hear
 Such gallant chiding for besides the groves
 The skies the fountains every region near
 Seemd all one mutual cry I never heard
 So musical a discord such sweet thunder
 THESEUS My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind
 So flewd so sanded and their heads are hung
 With ears that sweep away the morning dew
 Crookkneed and dewlappd like Thessalian bulls
 Slow in pursuit but matchd in mouth like bells
 Each under each A cry more tuneable
 Was never hollad to nor cheerd with horn
 In Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly
 Judge when you hear But soft what nymphs are these
 EGEUS My lord this is my daughter here asleep
 And this Lysander this Demetrius is
 This Helena old Nedars Helena
 I wonder of their being here together
 THESEUS No doubt they rose up early to observe
 The rite of May and hearing our intent
 Came here in grace of our solemnity
 But speak Egeus is not this the day
 That Hermia should give answer of her choice
 EGEUS It is my lord
 THESEUS Go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
 Horns and shout within The sleepers
 awake and kneel to THESEUS
 Goodmorrow friends Saint Valentine is past
 Begin these woodbirds but to couple now
 LYSANDER Pardon my lord
 THESEUS I pray you all stand up
 I know you two are rival enemies
 How comes this gentle concord in the world
 That hatred is so far from jealousy
 To sleep by hate and fear no enmity
 LYSANDER My lord I shall reply amazedly
 Half sleep half waking but as yet I swear
 I cannot truly say how I came here
 But as I think for truly would I speak
 And now I do bethink me so it is
 I came with Hermia hither Our intent
 Was to be gone from Athens where we might
 Without the peril of the Athenian law
 EGEUS Enough enough my Lord you have enough
 I beg the law the law upon his head
 They would have stoln away they would Demetrius
 Thereby to have defeated you and me
 You of your wife and me of my consent
 Of my consent that she should be your wife
 DEMETRIUS My lord fair Helen told me of their stealth
 Of this their purpose hither to this wood
 And I in fury hither followed them
 Fair Helena in fancy following me
 But my good lord I wot not by what power
 But by some power it is my love to Hermia
 Melted as the snow seems to me now
 As the remembrance of an idle gaud
 Which in my childhood I did dote upon
 And all the faith the virtue of my heart
 The object and the pleasure of mine eye
 Is only Helena To her my lord
 Was I betrothd ere I saw Hermia
 But like a sickness did I loathe this food
 But as in health come to my natural taste
 Now I do wish it love it long for it
 And will for evermore be true to it
 THESEUS Fair lovers you are fortunately met
 Of this discourse we more will hear anon
 Egeus I will overbear your will
 For in the temple by and by with us
 These couples shall eternally be knit
 And for the morning now is something worn
 Our purposd hunting shall be set aside
 Away with us to Athens three and three
 Well hold a feast in great solemnity
 Come Hippolyta
 Exeunt THESEUS HIPPOLYTA EGEUS and train
 DEMETRIUS These things seem small and undistinguishable
 Like faroff mountains turned into clouds
 HERMIA Methinks I see these things with parted eye
 When every thing seems double
 HELENA So methinks
 And I have found Demetrius like a jewel
 Mine own and not mine own
 DEMETRIUS Are you sure
 That we are awake It seems to me
 That yet we sleep we dream Do not you think
 The Duke was here and bid us follow him
 HERMIA Yea and my father
 HELENA And Hippolyta
 LYSANDER And he did bid us follow to the temple
 DEMETRIUS Why then we are awake lets follow him
 And by the way let us recount our dreams Exeunt
 BOTTOM Awaking When my cue comes call me and I will
answer My
 next is Most fair Pyramus Heighho Peter Quince Flute
the
 bellowsmender Snout the tinker Starveling Gods my life
 stoln hence and left me asleep I have had a most rare
vision
 I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it
was
 Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream
Methought
 I was there is no man can tell what Methought I was and
 methought I had but man is but a patchd fool if he will
offer
 to say what methought I had The eye of man hath not heard
the
 ear of man hath not seen mans hand is not able to taste
his
 tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream
was I
 will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream It
shall
 be calld Bottoms Dream because it hath no bottom and I
will
 sing it in the latter end of a play before the Duke
 Peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall sing it
at
 her death Exit




SCENE II

 FLUTE If he come not then the play is marrd it goes not

 QUINCE It is not possible You have not a man in all Athens
able
 to discharge Pyramus but he
 FLUTE No he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in
 Athens
 QUINCE Yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour

 FLUTE You must say paragon A paramour is God bless us A
 thing of naught

 Enter SNUG

 SNUG Masters the Duke is coming from the temple and there is
two
 or three lords and ladies more married If our sport had gone

 FLUTE O sweet bully Bottom Thus hath he lost sixpence a day

the
 Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus

Pyramus
 or nothing

 Enter BOTTOM

 BOTTOM Where are these lads Where are these hearts
 QUINCE Bottom O most courageous day O most happy hour
 BOTTOM Masters I am to discourse wonders but ask me not

shall
 hang out for the lions claws And most dear actors eat no
 onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and I do
not
 doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy No more
words
 Away go away Exeunt

ACT V SCENE I
Athens The palace of THESEUS

Enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA PHILOSTRATE LORDS and ATTENDANTS

 HIPPOLYTA Tis strange my Theseus that these lovers speak
of
 THESEUS More strange than true I never may believe
 These antique fables nor these fairy toys
 Lovers and madmen have such seething brains
 Such shaping fantasies that apprehend
 More than cool reason ever comprehends
 The lunatic the lover and the poet
 Are of imagination all compact
 One sees more devils than vast hell can hold
 That is the madman The lover all as frantic
 Sees Helens beauty in a brow of Egypt
 The poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling
 Doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven
 And as imagination bodies forth
 The forms of things unknown the poets pen
 Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
 A local habitation and a name
 Such tricks hath strong imagination
 That if it would but apprehend some joy
 It comprehends some bringer of that joy
 Or in the night imagining some fear
 How easy is a bush supposd a bear
 HIPPOLYTA But all the story of the night told over
 And all their minds transfigurd so together
 More witnesseth than fancys images
 And grows to something of great constancy
 But howsoever strange and admirable

 Enter LYSANDER DEMETRIUS HERMIA and HELENA

 THESEUS Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth
 Joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love
 Accompany your hearts
 LYSANDER More than to us
 Wait in your royal walks your board your bed
 THESEUS Come now what masques what dances shall we have
 To wear away this long age of three hours
 Between our aftersupper and bedtime
 Where is our usual manager of mirth
 What revels are in hand Is there no play
 To ease the anguish of a torturing hour
 Call Philostrate
 PHILOSTRATE Here mighty Theseus
 THESEUS Say what abridgment have you for this evening
 What masque what music How shall we beguile
 The lazy time if not with some delight
 PHILOSTRATE There is a brief how many sports are ripe
 Make choice of which your Highness will see first
 Giving a paper
 THESEUS The battle with the Centaurs to be sung
 By an Athenian eunuch to the harp
 Well none of that that have I told my love
 In glory of my kinsman Hercules
 The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals
 Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage
 That is an old device and it was playd
 When I from Thebes came last a conqueror
 The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
 Of Learning late deceasd in beggary
 That is some satire keen and critical
 Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
 A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
 And his love Thisby very tragical mirth
 Merry and tragical tedious and brief
 That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
 How shall we find the concord of this discord
 PHILOSTRATE A play there is my lord some ten words long
 Which is as brief as I have known a play
 But by ten words my lord it is too long
 Which makes it tedious for in all the play
 There is not one word apt one player fitted
 And tragical my noble lord it is
 For Pyramus therein doth kill himself
 Which when I saw rehearsd I must confess
 Made mine eyes water but more merry tears
 The passion of loud laughter never shed
 THESEUS What are they that do play it
 PHILOSTRATE Hardhanded men that work in Athens here
 Which never labourd in their minds till now
 And now have toild their unbreathed memories
 With this same play against your nuptial
 THESEUS And we will hear it
 PHILOSTRATE No my noble lord
 It is not for you I have heard it over
 And it is nothing nothing in the world
 Unless you can find sport in their intents
 Extremely stretchd and connd with cruel pain
 To do you service
 THESEUS I will hear that play
 For never anything can be amiss
 When simpleness and duty tender it
 Go bring them in and take your places ladies
 Exit PHILOSTRATE
 HIPPOLYTA I love not to see wretchedness oercharged
 And duty in his service perishing
 THESEUS Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
 HIPPOLYTA He says they can do nothing in this kind
 THESEUS The kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
 Our sport shall be to take what they mistake
 And what poor duty cannot do noble respect
 Takes it in might not merit
 Where I have come great clerks have purposed
 To greet me with premeditated welcomes
 Where I have seen them shiver and look pale
 Make periods in the midst of sentences
 Throttle their practisd accent in their fears
 And in conclusion dumbly have broke off
 Not paying me a welcome Trust me sweet
 Out of this silence yet I pickd a welcome
 And in the modesty of fearful duty
 I read as much as from the rattling tongue
 Of saucy and audacious eloquence
 Love therefore and tonguetied simplicity
 In least speak most to my capacity

 Reenter PHILOSTRATE

 PHILOSTRATE So please your Grace the Prologue is addressd
 THESEUS Let him approach Flourish of trumpets

 Enter QUINCE as the PROLOGUE

 PROLOGUE If we offend it is with our good will
 That you should think we come not to offend
 But with good will To show our simple skill
 That is the true beginning of our end
 Consider then we come but in despite
 We do not come as minding to content you
 Our true intent is All for your delight
 We are not here That you should here repent you
 The actors are at hand and by their show
 You shall know all that you are like to know
 THESEUS This fellow doth not stand upon points
 LYSANDER He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows
not
 the stop A good moral my lord it is not enough to speak
but
 to speak true
 HIPPOLYTA Indeed he hath playd on this prologue like a child
on a
 recorder a sound but not in government
 THESEUS His speech was like a tangled chain nothing im
paired
 but all disordered Who is next

 Enter with a trumpet before them as in dumb show
 PYRAMUS and THISBY WALL MOONSHINE and LION

 PROLOGUE Gentles perchance you wonder at this show
 But wonder on till truth make all things plain
 This man is Pyramus if you would know
 This beauteous lady Thisby is certain
 This man with lime and roughcast doth present
 Wall that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder
 And through Walls chink poor souls they are content
 To whisper At the which let no man wonder
 This man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn
 Presenteth Moonshine for if you will know
 By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
 To meet at Ninus tomb there there to woo
 This grisly beast which Lion hight by name
 The trusty Thisby coming first by night
 Did scare away or rather did affright
 And as she fled her mantle she did fall
 Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
 Anon comes Pyramus sweet youth and tall
 And finds his trusty Thisbys mantle slain
 Whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade
 He bravely broachd his boiling bloody breast
 And Thisby tarrying in mulberry shade
 His dagger drew and died For all the rest
 Let Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain
 At large discourse while here they do remain
 Exeunt PROLOGUE PYRAMUS THISBY
 LION and MOONSHINE
 THESEUS I wonder if the lion be to speak
 DEMETRIUS No wonder my lord one lion may when many asses
do
 WALL In this same interlude it doth befall
 That I one Snout by name present a wall
 And such a wall as I would have you think
 That had in it a crannied hole or chink
 Through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisby
 Did whisper often very secretly
 This loam this roughcast and this stone doth show
 That I am that same wall the truth is so
 And this the cranny is right and sinister
 Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper
 THESEUS Would you desire lime and hair to speak better
 DEMETRIUS It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
 discourse my lord

 Enter PYRAMUS

 THESEUS Pyramus draws near the wall silence
 PYRAMUS O grimlookd night O night with hue so black
 O night which ever art when day is not
 O night O night alack alack alack
 I fear my Thisbys promise is forgot
 And thou O wall O sweet O lovely wall
 That standst between her fathers ground and mine
 Thou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wall
 Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
 WALL holds up his fingers
 Thanks courteous wall Jove shield thee well for this
 But what see what see I No Thisby do I see
 O wicked wall through whom I see no bliss
 Cursd be thy stones for thus deceiving me
 THESEUS The wall methinks being sensible should curse
again
 PYRAMUS No in truth sir he should not Deceiving me is
Thisbys
 cue She is to enter now and I am to spy her through the
wall
 You shall see it will fall pat as I told you yonder she
comes

 Enter THISBY

 THISBY O wall full often hast thou heard my moans
 For parting my fair Pyramus and me
 My cherry lips have often kissd thy stones
 Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee
 PYRAMUS I see a voice now will I to the chink
 To spy an I can hear my Thisbys face
 Thisby
 THISBY My love thou art my love I think
 PYRAMUS Think what thou wilt I am thy lovers grace
 And like Limander am I trusty still
 THISBY And I like Helen till the Fates me kill
 PYRAMUS Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true
 THISBY As Shafalus to Procrus I to you
 PYRAMUS O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
 THISBY I kiss the walls hole not your lips at all
 PYRAMUS Wilt thou at Ninnys tomb meet me straightway
 THISBY Tide life tide death I come without delay
 Exeunt PYRAMUS and THISBY
 WALL Thus have I Wall my part discharged so
 And being done thus Wall away doth go Exit WALL
 THESEUS Now is the moon used between the two neighbours
 DEMETRIUS No remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear
 without warning
 HIPPOLYTA This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard
 THESEUS The best in this kind are but shadows and the worst
are
 no worse if imagination amend them
 HIPPOLYTA It must be your imagination then and not theirs
 THESEUS If we imagine no worse of them than they of
themselves
 they may pass for excellent men Here come two noble beasts
in a
 man and a lion

 Enter LION and MOONSHINE

 LION You ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear
 The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor
 May now perchance both quake and tremble here
 When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
 Then know that I as Snug the joiner am
 A lion fell nor else no lions dam
 For if I should as lion come in strife
 Into this place twere pity on my life
 THESEUS A very gentle beast and of a good conscience
 DEMETRIUS The very best at a beast my lord that eer I saw
 LYSANDER This lion is a very fox for his valour
 THESEUS True and a goose for his discretion
 DEMETRIUS Not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his
 discretion and the fox carries the goose
 THESEUS His discretion I am sure cannot carry his valour
for
 the goose carries not the fox It is well Leave it to his
 discretion and let us listen to the Moon
 MOONSHINE This lanthorn doth the horned moon present
 DEMETRIUS He should have worn the horns on his head
 THESEUS He is no crescent and his horns are invisible within
the
 circumference
 MOONSHINE This lanthorn doth the horned moon present
 Myself the Man i th Moon do seem to be
 THESEUS This is the greatest error of all the rest the man
should
 be put into the lantern How is it else the man i th moon
 DEMETRIUS He dares not come there for the candle for you
see it
 is already in snuff
 HIPPOLYTA I am aweary of this moon Would he would change
 THESEUS It appears by his small light of discretion that he
is
 in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must
stay
 the time
 LYSANDER Proceed Moon
 MOONSHINE All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn
is
 the moon I the Man i th Moon this thornbush my
thornbush
 and this dog my dog
 DEMETRIUS Why all these should be in the lantern for all
these
 are in the moon But silence here comes Thisby

 Reenter THISBY

 THISBY This is old Ninnys tomb Where is my love
 LION Roaring O THISBY runs off
 DEMETRIUS Well roard Lion
 THESEUS Well run Thisby
 HIPPOLYTA Well shone Moon Truly the moon shines with a good
 grace The LION tears THISBYS Mantle and exit
 THESEUS Well mousd Lion

 Reenter PYRAMUS

 DEMETRIUS And then came Pyramus
 LYSANDER And so the lion vanishd
 PYRAMUS Sweet Moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams
 I thank thee Moon for shining now so bright
 For by thy gracious golden glittering gleams
 I trust to take of truest Thisby sight
 But stay O spite
 But mark poor knight
 What dreadful dole is here
 Eyes do you see
 How can it be
 O dainty duck O dear
 Thy mantle good
 What staind with blood
 Approach ye Furies fell
 O Fates come come
 Cut thread and thrum
 Quail crush conclude and quell
 THESEUS This passion and the death of a dear friend would go
 near to make a man look sad
 HIPPOLYTA Beshrew my heart but I pity the man
 PYRAMUS O wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame
 Since lion vile hath here deflowerd my dear
 Which is no no which was the fairest dame
 That livd that lovd that likd that lookd with cheer
 Come tears confound
 Out sword and wound
 The pap of Pyramus
 Ay that left pap
 Where heart doth hop Stabs himself
 Thus die I thus thus thus
 Now am I dead
 Now am I fled
 My soul is in the sky
 Tongue lose thy light
 Moon take thy flight Exit MOONSHINE
 Now die die die die die Dies
 DEMETRIUS No die but an ace for him for he is but one
 LYSANDER Less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
 THESEUS With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and
yet prove an ass
 HIPPOLYTA How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisby comes
back
 and finds her lover

 Reenter THISBY

 THESEUS She will find him by starlight Here she comes and
her
 passion ends the play
 HIPPOLYTA Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
 Pyramus I hope she will be brief
 DEMETRIUS A mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which
 Thisby is the better he for a man God warrant us She for
a
 woman God bless us
 LYSANDER She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
 DEMETRIUS And thus she moans videlicet
 THISBY Asleep my love
 What dead my dove
 O Pyramus arise
 Speak speak Quite dumb
 Dead dead A tomb
 Must cover thy sweet eyes
 These lily lips
 This cherry nose
 These yellow cowslip cheeks
 Are gone are gone
 Lovers make moan
 His eyes were green as leeks
 O Sisters Three
 Come come to me
 With hands as pale as milk
 Lay them in gore
 Since you have shore
 With shears his thread of silk
 Tongue not a word
 Come trusty sword
 Come blade my breast imbrue Stabs herself
 And farewell friends
 Thus Thisby ends
 Adieu adieu adieu Dies
 THESEUS Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead
 DEMETRIUS Ay and Wall too
 BOTTOM Starting up No I assure you the wall is down that
 parted their fathers Will it please you to see the Epilogue
or
 to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company
 THESEUS No epilogue I pray you for your play needs no
excuse
 Never excuse for when the players are all dead there need
none
 to be blamed Marry if he that writ it had played Pyramus
and
 hangd himself in Thisbys garter it would have been a fine
 tragedy And so it is truly and very notably dischargd
But
 come your Bergomask let your epilogue alone A dance
 The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
 Lovers to bed tis almost fairy time
 I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn
 As much as we this night have overwatchd
 This palpablegross play hath well beguild
 The heavy gait of night Sweet friends to bed
 A fortnight hold we this solemnity
 In nightly revels and new jollity Exeunt

 Enter PUCK with a broom

 PUCK Now the hungry lion roars
 And the wolf behowls the moon
 Whilst the heavy ploughman snores
 All with weary task fordone
 Now the wasted brands do glow
 Whilst the screechowl screeching loud
 Puts the wretch that lies in woe
 In remembrance of a shroud
 Now it is the time of night
 That the graves all gaping wide
 Every one lets forth his sprite
 In the churchway paths to glide
 And we fairies that do run
 By the triple Hecates team
 From the presence of the sun
 Following darkness like a dream
 Now are frolic Not a mouse
 Shall disturb this hallowed house
 I am sent with broom before
 To sweep the dust behind the door

 Enter OBERON and TITANIA with all their train

 OBERON Through the house give glimmering light
 By the dead and drowsy fire
 Every elf and fairy sprite
 Hop as light as bird from brier
 And this ditty after me
 Sing and dance it trippingly
 TITANIA First rehearse your song by rote
 To each word a warbling note
 Hand in hand with fairy grace
 Will we sing and bless this place

 OBERON leading the FAIRIES sing and dance

 OBERON Now until the break of day
 Through this house each fairy stray
 To the best bridebed will we
 Which by us shall blessed be
 And the issue there create
 Ever shall be fortunate
 So shall all the couples three
 Ever true in loving be
 And the blots of Natures hand
 Shall not in their issue stand
 Never mole harelip nor scar
 Nor mark prodigious such as are
 Despised in nativity
 Shall upon their children be
 With this fielddew consecrate
 Every fairy take his gait
 And each several chamber bless
 Through this palace with sweet peace
 And the owner of it blest
 Ever shall in safety rest
 Trip away make no stay
 Meet me all by break of day Exeunt all but PUCK
 PUCK If we shadows have offended
 Think but this and all is mended
 That you have but slumbred here
 While these visions did appear
 And this weak and idle theme
 No more yielding but a dream
 Gentles do not reprehend
 If you pardon we will mend
 And as I am an honest Puck
 If we have unearned luck
 Now to scape the serpents tongue
 We will make amends ere long
 Else the Puck a liar call
 So good night unto you all
 Give me your hands if we be friends
 And Robin shall restore amends Exit
