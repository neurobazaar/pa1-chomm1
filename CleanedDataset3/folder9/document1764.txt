BILLY AND THE BIG STICK

by Richard Harding Davis



Had the Wilmot Electric Light people remained content only to make
light had they not as a byproduct attempted to make money they need
not have left Hayti

When they flooded with radiance the unpaved streets of PortauPrince no
one except the police who complained that the lights kept them awake
made objection but when for this illumination the Wilmot Company
demanded payment every one up to President Hamilear Poussevain was
surprised and grieved So grieved was President Ham as he was lovingly
designated that he withdrew the Wilmot concession surrounded the
powerhouse with his barefooted army and in a proclamation announced
that for the future the furnishing of electric light would be a monopoly
of the government

In Hayti as soon as it begins to make money any industry native or
foreign becomes a monopoly of the government The thing works
automatically It is what in Hayti is understood as _haute_ finance The
Wilmot people should have known that Because they did not know that
they stood to lose what they had sunk in the electriclight plant and
after their departure to New York which departure was accelerated as
far as the wharf by seven generals and twelve privates they proceeded
to lose more money on lobbyists and lawyers who claimed to understand
international law even the law of Hayti And lawyers who understand
that are highpriced

The only employee of the Wilmot force who was not escorted to the wharf
under guard was Billy Barlow He escaped the honor because he was
superintendent of the powerhouse and President Ham believed that
without him the lightning would not strike Accordingly by an executive
order Billy became an employee of the government With this arrangement
the Wilmot people were much pleased For they trusted Billy and they
knew while in the courts they were righting to regain their property
he would see no harm came to it

Billys title was Directeur General et Inspecteur Municipal de Luminaire
Electrique which is some title and his salary was fifty dollars a
week In spite of Billys color President Ham always treated his only
white official with courtesy and gave him his full title About giving
him his full salary he was less particular This neglect greatly annoyed
Billy He came of sturdy New England stock and possessed that New
England conscience which makes the owner a torment to himself and to
every one else a nuisance Like all the other Barlows of Barnstable on
Cape Cod Billy had worked for his every penny He was no shirker From
the first day that he carried a pair of pliers in the leg pocket of his
overalls and in a sixtyknot gale stretched wires between icecapped
tele graph poles he had more than earned his wages Never whether on
time or at piecework had he by a slovenly job or by beating the
whistle robbed his employer And for his honest toil he was determined
to be as honestly paideven by President Hamilcar Poussevain And
President Ham never paid anybody neither the Armenian street peddlers
in whose sweets he delighted nor the Bethlehem Steel Company nor the
house of Rothschild

Why he paid Billy even the small sums that from time to time Billy wrung
from the presidents strong box the foreign colony were at a loss to
explain Wagner the new American consul asked Billy how he managed it
As an American minister had not yet been appointed to the duties of the
consul as Wagner assured everybody were added those of diplomacy But
Haytian diplomacy he had yet to master At the seaport in Scotland where
he had served as viceconsul law and order were as solidly established
as the stone jetties and by contrast the eccentricities of the Black
REPUBLIC baffled and distressed him

It cant be that you blackmail the president said the consul
because I understand he boasts he has committed all the known crimes

And several he invented agreed Billy

And you cant do it with a gun because they tell me the president
isnt afraid of anything except a voodoo priestess What is your
secret coaxed the consul If youll only sell it I know several
Powers that would give you your price Billy smiled modestly

Its very simple he said The first time my wages were shy I went to
the palace and told him if he didnt come across Id shut off the juice
I think he was so stunned at anybody asking him for real money that
while he was still stunned he opened his safe and handed me two thousand
francs I think he did it more in admiration for my nerve than because
he owed it The next time payday arrived and the pay did not I didnt
go to the palace I just went to bed and the lights went to bed too
You may remember The consul snorted indignantly

I was holding three queens at the time he protested Was it YOU did
that

It was said Billy The police came for me to start the current going
again but I said I was too ill Then the presidents own doctor came
old Gautier and Gautier examined me with a lantern and said that in
Hayti my disease frequently proved fatal but he thought if I turned on
the lights I might recover I told him I was tired of life anyway but
that if I could see three thousand francs it might give me an incentive
He reported back to the president and the three thousand francs arrived
almost instantly and a chicken broth from Hams own chef with His
Excellencys best wishes for the recovery of the invalid My recovery
was instantaneous and I switched on the lights

I had just moved into the Widow Ducrots hotel that week and her
daughter Claire wouldnt let me eat the broth I thought it was because
as shes a dandy cook herself she was professionally jealous She put
the broth on the top shelf of the pantry and wrote on a piece of paper
Gare But the next morning a perfectly good cat who apparently
couldnt read was lying beside it dead

The consul frowned reprovingly

You should not make such reckless charges he protested I would call
it only a coincidence

You can call it what you please said Billy but it wont bring the
cat back Anyway the next time I went to the palace to collect the
president was ready for me He said hed been taking out information
and he found if I shut off the lights again he could hire another man
in the States to turn them on I told him hed been deceived I told him
the Wilmot Electric Lights were produced by a secret process and that
only a trained Wilmot man could work them And I pointed out to him
if he dismissed me it wasnt likely the Wilmot people would loan him
another expert not while they were fighting him through the courts
and the State Department That impressed the old man so I issued my
ultimatum I said if he must have electric lights he must have me too
Whether he liked it or not mine was a life job

What did he say to that gasped the new consul

Said it wasnt a life job because he was going to have me shot at
sunset

Then you said

I said if he did that there wouldnt be any electric lights and you
would bring a warship and shoot Hayti off the map

The new consul was most indignant

You had no right to say that he protested You did very ill My
instructions are to avoid all serious complications

That was what I was trying to avoid said Billy Dont you call
being shot at sunset a serious complication Or would that be just a
coincidence too Youre a hellofa consul

Since his talk with the representative of his country four months had
passed and Billy still held his job But each month the number of francs
he was able to wrest from President Hamilcar dwindled and were won only
after verbal conflicts that each month increased in violence

To the foreign colony it became evident that in the side of President
Ham Billy was a thorn sharp irritating virulent and that at any
moment Ham might pluck that thorn and Billy would leave Hayti in haste
and probably in handcuffs This was evident to Billy also and the
prospect was most disquieting Not because he loved Hayti but because
since he went to lodge at the cafe of the Widow Ducrot he had learned
to love her daughter Claire and Claire loved him

On the two thousand dollars due him from Ham they plotted to marry This
was not as great an adventure as it might appear Billy knew that from
the Wilmot people he always was sure of a salary and one which with
such an excellent housekeeper as was Claire would support them both
But with his two thousand dollars as capital they could afford to
plunge they could go upon a honeymoon they need not dread a rainy day
and what was of greatest importance they need not delay There was
good reason against delay for the hand of the beautiful Claire was
already promised The Widow Ducrot had promised it to Paillard he of
the prosperous commission business the prominent EMBONPOINT and four
children Monsieur Paillard possessed an establishment of his own but
it was a villa in the suburbs and so each day at noon for his DEJEUNE
he left his office and crossed the street to the Cafe Ducrot For five
years this had been his habit At first it was the widows cooking that
attracted him then for a time the widow herself but when from the
convent Claire came to assist her mother in the cafe and when from a
lanky bigeyed longlegged child she grew into a slim joyous and
charming young woman she alone was the attraction and the Widower
Paillard decided to make her his wife Other men had made the same
decision and when it was announced that between Claire and the widower
a marriage had been arranged the clerks in the foreign commission
houses and the agents of the steamship lines drowned their sorrow in
rum and ran the house flags to halfstaff Paillard himself took the
proposed alliance calmly He was not an impetuous suitor With Widow
Ducrot he agreed that Claire was still too young to marry and to
himself kept the fact that to remarry he was in no haste In his mind
doubts still lingered With a wife young enough to be one of his
children disorganizing the routine of his villa would it be any more
comfortable than he now found it Would his eldest daughter and her
stepmother dwell together in harmony The eldest daughter had assured
him that so far as she was concerned they would not and after all in
marrying a girl no matter how charming without a dot and the daughter
of a boardinghouse keeper no matter how respectable was he not
disposing of himself too cheaply These doubts assailed Papa Paillard
these speculations were in his mind And while he speculated Billy
acted

I know that in France Billy assured Claire marriages are arranged
by the parents but in my country they are arranged in heaven And who
are we to disregard the edicts of heaven Ages and ages ago before the
flood before Napoleon even before old Paillard with his four children
it was arranged in heaven that you were to marry me So what little
plans your good mother may make dont cut enough ice to cool a green
mint Now we cant try to get married here continued Billy without
your mother and Paillard knowing it In this town as many people have to
sign the marriage contract as signed our Declaration of Independence
all the civil authorities all the clergy all the relatives if every
man in the telephone book isnt a witness the marriage doesnt take
So we must elope

Having been brought up in a convent where she was taught to obey
her mother and forbidden to think of marriage Claire was naturally
delighted with the idea of an elopement

To where will we elope to she demanded Her English as she learned
it from Billy was sometimes confusing

To New York said Billy On the voyage there I will put you in charge
of the stewardess and the captain and there isnt a captain on the
Royal Dutch or the Atlas that hasnt known you since you were a baby
And as soon as we dock well drive straight to the city hall for a
license and the mayor himself will marry us Then Ill get back my old
job from the Wilmot folks and well live happy ever after

In New York also asked Claire proudly are you directeur of the
electric lights

On Broadway alone Billy explained reprovingly there is one sign
that uses more bulbs than there are in the whole of Hayti

New York is a large town exclaimed Claire

Its a large sign corrected Billy But he pointed out with no
money well never see it So tomorrow Im going to make a social call
on Grandpa Ham and demand my ten thousand francs Claire grasped his
arm

Be careful she pleaded Remember the chicken soup If he offers you
the champagne refuse it

He wont offer me the champagne Billy assured her It wont be that
kind of a call

Billy left the Cafe Ducrot and made his way to the waterfront He was
expecting some electrical supplies by the PRINZ DER NEDERLANDEN and she
had already come to anchor

He was late and save for a group of his countrymen who with the
customs officials were having troubles of their own the customs shed
was all but deserted Billy saw his freight cleared and was going away
when one of those in trouble signalled for assistance

He was a goodlooking young man in a Panama hat and his manner seemed
to take it for granted that Billy knew who he was They want us to pay
duty on our trunks he explained and we want to leave them in bond
Well be here only until tonight when were going on down the coast
to Santo Domingo But we dont speak French and we cant make them
understand that

You dont need to speak any language to give a man ten dollars said
Billy

Oh exclaimed the man in the Panama I was afraid if I tried that
they might arrest us

They may arrest you if you dont said Billy Acting both as
interpreter and disbursing agent Billy satisfied the demands of
his fellow employees of the government and his fellow countrymen he
directed to the Hotel Ducrot

As some one was sure to take their money he thought it might as well
go to his motherinlaw elect The young man in the Panama expressed
the deepest gratitude and Billy assuring him he would see him later
continued to the powerhouse still wondering where he had seen him
before

At the powerhouse he found seated at his desk a large bearded stranger
whose derby hat and readytowear clothes showed that he also had but
just arrived on the PRINZ DER NEDERLANDEN

You William Barlow demanded the stranger I understand you been
threatening unless you get your pay raised to commit sabotage on these
works

Who the devil are you inquired Billy

The stranger produced an impressivelooking document covered with seals

Contract with the president he said Ive taken over your job You
better get out quiet he advised as theyve given me a squad of
nigger policemen to see that you do

Are you aware that these works are the property of the Wilmot Company
asked Billy and that if anything went wrong here theyd hold you
responsible The stranger smiled complacently

Ive run plants he said that make these lights look like a stable
lantern on a foggy night

In that case assented Billy should anything happen youll know
exactly what to do and I can leave you in charge without feeling the
least anxiety

Thats just what you can do the stranger agreed heartily and you
cant do it too quick From the desk he took Billys favorite pipe and
loaded it from Billys tobaccojar But when Billy had reached the door
he called to him Before you go son he said you might give me a tip
about this climate I never been in the tropics Its kind of unhealthy
aint it

His expression was one of concern

If you hope to keep alive began Billy there are two things to
avoid The stranger laughed knowingly

I got you he interrupted Youre going to tell me to cut out wine
and women

I was going to tell you said Billy to cut out hoping to collect any
wages and to avoid every kind of soup

From the powerhouse Billy went direct to the palace His anxiety was
great Now that Claire had consented to leave Hayti the loss of his
position did not distress him But the possible loss of his back pay
would be a catastrophe He had hardly enough money to take them both
to New York and after they arrived none with which to keep them alive
Before the Wilmot Company could find a place for him a month might pass
and during that month they might starve If he went alone and arranged
for Claire to follow he might lose her Her mother might marry her to
Paillard Claire might fall ill without him at her elbow to keep her to
their purpose the voyage to an unknown land might require more courage
than she possessed Billy saw it was imperative they should depart
together and to that end he must have his two thousand dollars The
money was justly his For it he had sweated and slaved had given
his best effort And so when he faced the president he was in no
conciliatory mood Neither was the president

By what right he demanded did this foreigner affront his ears with
demands for money how dared he force his way into his presence and
to his face babble of back pay It was insolent incredible With
indignation the president set forth the position of the government
Billy had been discharged and with the appointment of his successor
the stranger in the derby hat had ceased to exist The government could
not pay money to some one who did not exist All indebtedness to Billy
also had ceased to exist The account had been wiped out Billy had been
wiped out The big negro with the chest and head of a gorilla tossed
his kinky white curls so violently that the ringlets danced Billy he
declared had been a pest a fly that buzzed and buzzed and disturbed
his slumbers And now when the fly thought he slept he had caught and
crushed itso President Ham clinched his great fist convulsively and
with delight in his pantomime opened his fingers one by one and held
out his pink palm wrinkled and crossed like the hand of a washerwoman
as though to show Billy that in it lay the fly dead

CEST UNE CHOSE JUGEE thundered the president He reached for his
quill pen

But Billy with Claire in his heart with the injustice of it rankling
in his mind did not agree

It is not an affair closed shouted Billy in his best French It is
an affair international diplomatic a cause for war

Believing he had gone mad President Ham gazed at him speechless

From here I go to the cable Office shouted Billy I cable for a
warship If by tonight I am not paid my money marines will
surround our powerhouse and the Wilmot people will back me up and my
government will back me up

It was so Billy thought even as he launched it a tirade satisfying
and magnificent But in his turn the president did not agree

He rose He was a large man Billy wondered he had not previously
noticed how very large he was

Tonight at nine oclock he said the German boat departs for New
York As though aiming a pistol he raised his arm and at Billy pointed
a finger If after she departs you are found in PortauPrince you
will be shot

The audiencechamber was hung with great mirrors in frames of tarnished
gilt In these Billy saw himself reproduced in a wavering line of
Billies that like the ghost of Banquo stretched to the disappearing
point Of such images there was an army but of the real Billy as he
was acutely conscious there was but one Among the black faces scowling
from the doorways he felt the odds were against him Without making a
reply he passed out between the racks of rusty muskets in the anteroom
between the two Gatling guns guarding the entrance and on the palace
steps in indecision halted

As Billy hesitated an officer followed him from the palace and beckoned
to the guard that sat in the bare dust of the Champ de Mars playing
cards for cartridges Two abandoned the game and having received their
orders picked their muskets from the dust and stood looking expectantly
at Billy

They were his escort and it was evident that until nine oclock when
he sailed his movements would be spied upon his acts reported to the
president

Such being the situation Billy determined that his first act to be
reported should be of a nature to cause the president active mental
anguish With his guard at his heels he went directly to the cable
station and to the Secretary of State of the United States addressed
this message President refuses my pay threatens shoot wireless
nearest warship proceed here full speed William Barlow

Billy and the director of telegraphs who out of office hours was a
fieldmarshal and when not in his shirtsleeves always appeared in
uniform went over each word of the cablegram together When Billy was
assured that the fieldmarshal had grasped the full significance of it
he took it back and added Love to Aunt Maria The extra words cost
four dollars and eighty cents gold but as they suggested ties of blood
between himself and the Secretary of State they seemed advisable
In the accountbook in which he recorded his daily expenditures Billy
credited the item to lifeinsurance

The revised cablegram caused the fieldmarshal deep concern He frowned
at Billy ferociously

I will forward this at once he promised But I warn you he added
I deliver also a copy to MY president

Billy sighed hopefully

You might deliver the copy first he suggested

From the cable station Billy still accompanied by his faithful
retainers returned to the powerhouse There he bade farewell to the
black brothers who had been his assistants and upon one of them pressed
a sum of money

As they parted this one as though giving the password of a secret
society chanted solemnly

A HUIT HEURES JUSTE And Billy clasped his hand and nodded

At the office of the Royal Dutch West India Line Billy purchased a
ticket to New York and inquired were there many passengers The ship is
empty said the agent

I am glad said Billy for one of my assistants may come with me He
also is being deported

You can have as many cabins as you want said the agent We are so
sorry to see you go that we will try to make you feel you leave us on
your private yacht

The next two hours Billy spent in seeking out those acquaintances
from whom he could borrow money He found that by asking for it in
homoeopathic doses he was able to shame the foreign colony into loaning
him all of one hundred dollars This with what he had in hand would
take Claire and himself to New York and for a week keep them alive
After that he must find work or they must starve

In the garden of the Cafe Ducrot Billy placed his guard at a table with
bottles of beer between them and at an adjoining table with Claire
plotted the elopement for that night The garden was in the rear of the
hotel and a door in the lower wall opened into the rue Cambon that led
directly to the waterfront

Billy proposed that at eight oclock Claire should be waiting in the rue
Cambon outside this door They would then make their way to one of the
less frequented wharfs where Claire would arrange to have a rowboat in
readiness and in it they would take refuge on the steamer An hour
later before the flight of Claire could be discovered they would have
started on their voyage to the mainland

I warn you said Billy that after we reach New York I have only
enough to keep us for a week It will be a brief honeymoon After that
we will probably starve Im not telling you this to discourage you he
explained only trying to be honest

I would rather starve with you in New York said Claire than die
here without you

At these words Billy desired greatly to kiss Claire but the guards were
scowling at him It was not until Claire had gone to her room to pack
her bag and the chance to kiss her had passed that Billy recognized that
the scowls were intended to convey the fact that the beer bottles were
empty He remedied this and remained alone at his table considering the
out look The horizon was indeed gloomy and the only light upon it
the loyalty and love of the girl only added to his bitterness Above
all things he desired to make her content to protect her from disquiet
to convince her that in the sacrifice she was making she also was
plotting her own happiness Had he been able to collect his ten thousand
francs his world would have danced in sunshine As it was the heavens
were gray and for the future the skies promised only rainy days In
these de pressing reflections Billy was interrupted by the approach of
the young man in the Panama hat Billy would have avoided him but the
young man and his two friends would not be denied For the service Billy
had rendered them they wished to express their gratitude It found
expression in the form of Planters punch As they consumed this Billy
explained to the strangers why the customs men had detained them

You told them you were leaving tonight for Santo Domingo said Billy
but they knew that was impossible for there is no steamer down the
coast for two weeks

The one whose features seemed familiar replied

Still we are leaving tonight he said not on a steamer but on a
warship

A warship cried Billy His heart beat at high speed Then he
exclaimed you are a naval officer

The young man shook his head and as though challenging Billy to make
another guess smiled

Then Billy complied eagerly you are a diplomat Are you our new
minister

One of the other young men exclaimed reproachfully

You know him perfectly well he protested Youve seen his picture
thousands of times

With awe and pride he placed his hand on Billys arm and with the other
pointed at the one in the Panama hat

Its Harry St Clair he announced Harry St Clair the King of the
Movies

The King of the Movies repeated Billy His disappointment was so keen
as to be embarrassing

Oh he exclaimed I thought you Then he remembered his manners
Glad to meet you he said Seen you on the screen

Again his own troubles took precedence Did you say he demanded One
of our warships is coming here TODAY

Coming to take me to Santo Domingo explained Mr St Clair He spoke
airily as though to him as a means of locomotion battleships were
as trolleycars The Planters punch which was something he had
never before encountered encouraged the great young man to unbend He
explained further and fully and Billy his mind intent upon his own
affair pretended to listen

The United States Government Mr St Clair explained was assisting him
and the Apollo Film Company in producing the eightreel film entitled
The Man Behind the Gun

With it the Navy Department plotted to advertise the navy and encourage
recruiting In moving pictures in the form of a story with love
interest villain comic relief and thrills it would show the life of
American bluejackets afloat and ashore at home and abroad They would
be seen at Yokohama playing baseball with Tokio University in the
courtyard of the Vatican receiving the blessing of the Pope at Waikiki
riding the breakers on a scrubbingboard in the Philippines eating
cocoanuts in the shade of the sheltering palm and in Brooklyn in the
Y M C A club in the shadow of the New York skyscrapers playing
billiards and reading the sporting extras

As it would be illustrated on the film the life of The Man Behind the
Gun was one of luxurious ease In it coalpassing standing watch in a
blizzard and washing down decks cold and unsympathetic held no part
But to prove that the life of Jack was not all play he would be seen
fighting for the flag That was where as Lieutenant Hardy U S A
the King of the Movies entered

Our company arrived in Santo Domingo last week he explained And
theyre waiting for me now Im to lead the attack on the fortress We
land in shore boats under the guns of the ship and I take the fortress
First we show the ship clearing for action and the men lowering the
boats and pulling for shore Then we cut back to show the guncrews
serving the guns Then we jump to the landingparty wading through the
breakers I lead them The man who is carrying the flag gets shot and
drops in the surf I pick him up put him on my shoulder and carry him
and the flag to the beach where

Billy suddenly awoke His tone was one of excited interest

You got a uniform he demanded

Three said St Clair impressively made to order according to
regulations on file in the Quartermasters Department Each absolutely
correct Without too great a show of eagerness he inquired Like to
see them

Without too great a show of eagerness Billy assured him that he would

I got to telephone first he added but by the time you get your
trunk open Ill join you in your room

In the cafe over the telephone Billy addressed himself to the
fieldmarshal in charge of the cable office When Billy gave his name
the voice of that dignitary became violently agitated

Monsieur Barlow he demanded do you know that the warship for which
you cabled your Secretary of State makes herself to arrive

At the other end of the phone although restrained by the confines of
the booth Billy danced joyously But his voice was stern

Naturally he replied Where is she now

An hour before so the fieldmarshal informed him the battleship
LOUISIANA had been sighted and by telegraph reported She was
approaching under forced draft At any moment she might anchor in the
outer harbor Of this President Ham had been informed He was grieved
indignant he was also at a loss to understand

It is very simple explained Billy She probably was somewhere in
the Windward Passage When the Secretary got my message he cabled
Guantanamo and Guantanamo wired the warship nearest PortauPrince

President Poussevain warned the field marshal is greatly disturbed

Tell him not to worry said Billy Tell him when the bombardment
begins I will see that the palace is outside the zone of fire

As Billy entered the room of St Clair his eyes shone with a strange
light His manner which toward a man of his repute St Clair
had considered a little too casual was now enthusiastic almost
affectionate

My dear St Clair cried Billy IVE FIXED IT But until I was SURE
I didnt want to raise your hopes

Hopes of what demanded the actor

An audience with the president cried Billy Ive just called him up
and he says Im to bring you to the palace at once Hes heard of you
of course and hes very pleased to meet you I told him about The Man
Behind the Gun and he says you must come in your makeup as Lieutenant
Hardy USA just as hell see you on the screen

Mr St Clair stammered delightedly

In uniform he protested wont that be

White special full dress insisted Billy Medals sidearms
fulldress belt and gloves What a press story The King of the Movies
Meets the President of Hayti Of course hes only an ignorant negro
but on Broadway they dont know that and it will sound fine St Clair
coughed nervously

DONT forget he stammered I cant speak French or understand it
either

The eyes of Billy became as innocent as those of a china doll

Then Ill interpret he said And oh yes he added hes sending
two of the palace soldiers to act as an escortsort of guard of honor

The King of the Movies chuckled excitedly

Fine he exclaimed You ARE a brick

With trembling fingers he began to shed his outer garments

To hide his own agitation Billy walked to the window and turned his
back Night had fallen and the electric lights that once had been his
care sprang into life Billy looked at his watch It was seven oclock
The window gave upon the harbor and a mile from shore he saw the cargo
lights of the PRINZ DER NEDERLANDEN and slowly approaching as though
feeling for her berth a great battleship When Billy turned from the
window his voice was apparently undisturbed

Weve got to hurry he said The LOUISIANA is standing in Shell
soon be sending a launch for you Weve just time to drive to the palace
and back before the launch gets here

From his mind President Ham had dismissed all thoughts of the warship
that had been sighted and that now had come to anchor For the moment he
was otherwise concerned Fate could not harm him he was about to dine

But for the first time in the history of his administration that
solemn ceremony was rudely halted An excited aide trembling at his own
temerity burst upon the presidents solitary state

In the anteroom he announced an officer from the battleship LOUISIANA
demanded instant audience

For a moment transfixed in amazement anger and alarm President Ham
remained seated Such a visit uninvited was against all tradition it
was an affront an insult But that it was against all precedent argued
some serious necessity He decided it would be best to receive the
officer Besides to continue his dinner was now out of the question
Both appetite and digestion had fled from him

In the anteroom Billy was whispering final instructions to St Clair

Whatever happens he begged dont LAUGH Dont even smile politely
Hes very ignorant you see and hes sensitive When he meets
foreigners and cant understand their language hes always afraid if
they laugh that hes made a break and that theyre laughing at HIM So
be solemn look grave look haughty

I got you assented St Clair Im to register pride

Exactly said Billy The more pride you register the better for us

Inwardly cold with alarm outwardly frigidly polite Billy presented
Lieutenant Hardy He had come Billy explained in answer to the call
for help sent by himself to the Secretary of State which by wireless
had been communicated to the LOUISIANA Lieutenant Hardy begged him
to say to the president that he was desolate at having to approach His
Excellency so unceremoniously But His Excellency having threatened the
life of an American citizen the captain of the LOUISIANA was forced to
act quickly

And this officer demanded President Ham what does he want

He says Billy translated to St Clair that he is very glad to meet
you and he wants to know how much you earn a week

The actor suppressed his surprise and with pardonable pride said that
his salary was six hundred dollars a week and royalties on each film
Billy bowed to the president

He says translated Billy he is here to see that I get my ten
thousand francs and that if I dont get them in ten minutes he will
return to the ship and land marines

To St Clair it seemed as though the president received his statement
as to the amount of his salary with a disapproval that was hardly
flattering With the heel of his giant fist the president beat upon the
table his curls shook his gorillalike shoulders heaved

In an explanatory aside Billy made this clear

He says he interpreted that you get more as an actor than he gets
as president and it makes him mad

I can see it does myself whispered St Clair And I dont understand
French either

President Ham was protesting violently It was outrageous he exclaimed
it was inconceivable that a great republic should shake the Big Stick
over the head of a small republic and for a contemptible ten thousand
francs

I will not believe he growled that this officer has authority
to threaten me You have deceived him If he knew the truth he would
apologize Tell him he roared suddenly that I DEMAND that he
apologize

Billy felt like the man who after jauntily forcing the fighting
unexpectedly gets a jolt on the chin that drops him to the canvas

While the referee might have counted three Billy remained upon the
canvas

Then again he forced the fighting Eagerly he turned to St Clair

He says he translated you must recite something St Clair
exclaimed incredulously Recite he gasped

Than his indignant protest nothing could have been more appropriate

Wants to see you act out insisted Billy Go on he begged humor
him Do what he wants or hell put us in jail

But what shall I

He wants the curse of Rome from Richelieu explained Billy He knows
it in French and he wants you to recite it in English Do you know it

The actor smiled haughtily

I WROTE it he protested Richelieus my middle name Ive done it in
stock

Then do it now commanded Billy Give it to him hot Im Julie de
Mortemar Hes the villain Barabas Begin where Barabas hands you the
cue The country is the king

In embarrassment St Clair coughed tentatively

Whoever heard of Cardinal Richelieu he protested in a navy
uniform

Begin begged Billy

Whatll I do with my cap whispered St Clair

In an ecstasy of alarm Billy danced from foot to foot Ill hold your
cap he cried Go on

St Clair gave his cap of gold braid to Billy and shifted his
fulldress swordbelt Not without concern did President Ham observe
these preparations For the fraction of a second in alarm his eyes
glanced to the exits He found that the officers of his staff completely
filled them Their presence gave him confidence and his eyes returned to
Lieutenant Hardy

That gentleman heaved a deep sigh Dejectedly his head fell forward
until his chin rested upon his chest Much to the relief of the
president it appeared evident that Lieutenant Hardy was about to accede
to his command and apologize St Clair groaned heavily

Ay is it so he muttered His voice was deep resonant vibrating
like a bell His eyes no longer suggested apology They were strange
flashing the eyes of a religious fanatic and balefully they were fixed
upon President Ham

Then wakes the power the deep voice rumbled that in the age of iron
burst forth to curb the great and raise the low He flung out his left
arm and pointed it at Billy

Mark where she stands he commanded

With a sweeping protecting gesture he drew around Billy an imaginary
circle The pantomime was only too clear To the aged negro who feared
neither God nor man but only voodoo there was in the voice and gesture
that which caused his blood to chill

Around her form shrieked St Clair I draw the awful circle of
our solemn church Set but one foot within that holy ground and on thy
head Like a semaphore the left arm dropped and the right arm with
the forefinger pointed shot out at President Ham Yea though it wore
a CROWNI launch the CURSE OF ROME

No one moved No one spoke What terrible threat had hit him President
Ham could not guess He did not ask Stiffly like a man in a trance he
turned to the rusty iron safe behind his chair and spun the handle When
again he faced them he held a long envelope which he presented to Billy

There are the ten thousand francs he said Ask him if he is
satisfied and demand that he go at once

Billy turned to St Clair

He says translated Billy hes very much obliged and hopes we will
come again Now commanded Billy bow low and go out facing him We
dont want him to shoot us in the back

Bowing to the president the actor threw at Billy a glance full of
indignation Was I as BAD as that he demanded

On schedule time Billy drove up to the Hotel Ducrot and relinquished St
Clair to the ensign in charge of the launch from the LOUISIANA At sight
of St Clair in the regalia of a superior officer that young gentleman
showed his surprise

Ive been giving a command performance for the president explained
the actor modestly I recited for him and though I spoke in English
I think I made quite a hit

You certainly Billy assured him gratefully made a terrible hit with
me

As the movingpicture actors escorted by the ensign followed their
trunks to the launch Billy looked after them with a feeling of great
loneliness He was aware that from the palace his carriage had been
followed that drawn in a cordon around the hotel negro policemen
covertly observed him That President Ham still hoped to recover his
lost prestige and his lost money was only too evident

It was just five minutes to eight

Billy ran to his room and with his suitcase in his hand slipped down
the back stairs and into the garden Cautiously he made his way to the
gate in the wall and in the street outside found Claire awaiting him

With a cry of relief she clasped his arm

You are safe she cried I was so frightened for you That President
Ham he is a beast an ogre Her voice sank to a whisper And for
myself also I have been frightened The police they are at each corner
They watch the hotel They watch ME Why What do they want

They want something of mine said Billy But I cant tell you what it
is until Im sure it is mine Is the boat at the wharf

All is arranged Claire assured him The boatmen are our friends
they will take us safely to the steamer

With a sigh of relief Billy lifted her valise and his own but he did
not move forward Anxiously Claire pulled at his sleeve

Come she begged For what it is that you wait

It was just eight oclock

Billy was looking up at the single electric light bulb that lit the
narrow street and following the direction of his eyes Claire saw the
light grow dim saw the tiny wires grow red and disappear From
over all the city came shouts and cries of consternation oaths and
laughter and then darkness

I was waiting for THIS cried Billy

With the delight of a mischievous child Claire laughed aloud

Youyou did it she accused

I did said Billy And nowwe must run like the devil

The PRINZ DER NEDERLANDEN was drawing slowly out of the harbor Shoulder
to shoulder Claire and Billy leaned upon the rail On the wharfs of
PortauPrince they saw lanterns tossing and candles twinkling saw the
LOUISIANA blazing like a Christmastree steaming majestically south
in each others eyes saw that all was well

From his pocket Billy drew a long envelope

I can now with certainty said Billy state that this is mineOURS

He opened the envelope and while Claire gazed upon many millefranc
notes Billy told how he had retrieved them

But what danger cried Claire In time Ham would have paid Your
president at Washington would have made him pay Why take such risks
You had but to wait

Billy smiled contentedly

Dear one he exclaimed the policy of watchful waiting is safer but
the Big Stick acts quicker and gets results
