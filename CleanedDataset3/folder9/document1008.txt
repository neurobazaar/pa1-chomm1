Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtytwo text
files per month or 384 more Etexts in 1997 for a total of 1000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 100 billion Etexts given away

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 10 of the present number of computer users 2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that so it
will require us reaching less than 5 of the users in 2001

THE VISION
OR
HELL PURGATORY AND PARADISE
OF
DANTE ALIGHIERI

TRANSLATED BY
THE REV H F CARY AM





HELL

CANTO I

IN the midway of this our mortal life
I found me in a gloomy wood astray
Gone from the path direct and een to tell
It were no easy task how savage wild
That forest how robust and rough its growth
Which to remember only my dismay
Renews in bitterness not far from death
Yet to discourse of what there good befell
All else will I relate discoverd there
How first I enterd it I scarce can say
Such sleepy dullness in that instant weighd
My senses down when the true path I left
But when a mountains foot I reachd where closd
The valley that had piercd my heart with dread
I lookd aloft and saw his shoulders broad
Already vested with that planets beam
Who leads all wanderers safe through every way
 Then was a little respite to the fear
That in my hearts recesses deep had lain
All of that night so pitifully passd
And as a man with difficult short breath
Forespent with toiling scapd from sea to shore
Turns to the perilous wide waste and stands
At gaze een so my spirit that yet faild
Struggling with terror turnd to view the straits
That none hath passd and livd My weary frame
After short pause recomforted again
I journeyd on over that lonely steep
The hinder foot still firmer Scarce the ascent
Began when lo a panther nimble light
And coverd with a speckled skin appeard
Nor when it saw me vanishd rather strove
To check my onward going that ofttimes
With purpose to retrace my steps I turnd
 The hour was mornings prime and on his way
Aloft the sun ascended with those stars
That with him rose when Love divine first movd
Those its fair works so that with joyous hope
All things conspird to fill me the gay skin
Of that swift animal the matin dawn
And the sweet season Soon that joy was chasd
And by new dread succeeded when in view
A lion came gainst me as it appeard
With his head held aloft and hungermad
That een the air was fearstruck A shewolf
Was at his heels who in her leanness seemd
Full of all wants and many a land hath made
Disconsolate ere now She with such fear
Oerwhelmed me at the sight of her appalld
That of the height all hope I lost As one
Who with his gain elated sees the time
When all unwares is gone he inwardly
Mourns with heartgriping anguish such was I
Haunted by that fell beast never at peace
Who coming oer against me by degrees
Impelld me where the sun in silence rests
 While to the lower space with backward step
I fell my ken discernd the form one of one
Whose voice seemd faint through long disuse of speech
When him in that great desert I espied
Have mercy on me cried I out aloud
Spirit or living man what eer thou be
 He answerd Now not man man once I was
And born of Lombard parents Mantuana both
By country when the power of Julius yet
Was scarcely firm At Rome my life was past
Beneath the mild Augustus in the time
Of fabled deities and false A bard
Was I and made Anchises upright son
The subject of my song who came from Troy
When the flames preyd on Iliums haughty towers
But thou say wherefore to such perils past
Returnst thou wherefore not this pleasant mount
Ascendest cause and source of all delight
And art thou then that Virgil that wellspring
From which such copious floods of eloquence
Have issued I with front abashd replied
Glory and light of all the tuneful train
May it avail me that I long with zeal
Have sought thy volume and with love immense
Have connd it oer My master thou and guide
Thou he from whom alone I have derivd
That style which for its beauty into fame
Exalts me See the beast from whom I fled
O save me from her thou illustrious sage
For every vein and pulse throughout my frame
She hath made tremble He soon as he saw
That I was weeping answerd Thou must needs
Another way pursue if thou wouldst scape
From out that savage wilderness This beast
At whom thou criest her way will suffer none
To pass and no less hindrance makes than death
So bad and so accursed in her kind
That never sated is her ravenous will
Still after food more craving than before
To many an animal in wedlock vile
She fastens and shall yet to many more
Until that greyhound come who shall destroy
Her with sharp pain He will not life support
By earth nor its base metals but by love
Wisdom and virtue and his land shall be
The land twixt either Feltro In his might
Shall safety to Italias plains arise
For whose fair realm Camilla virgin pure
Nisus Euryalus and Turnus fell
He with incessant chase through every town
Shall worry until he to hell at length
Restore her thence by envy first let loose
I for thy profit pondring now devise
That thou mayst follow me and I thy guide
Will lead thee hence through an eternal space
Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks and see
Spirits of old tormented who invoke
A second death and those next view who dwell
Content in fire for that they hope to come
Wheneer the time may be among the blest
Into whose regions if thou then desire
T ascend a spirit worthier then I
Must lead thee in whose charge when I depart
Thou shalt be left for that Almighty King
Who reigns above a rebel to his law
Adjudges me and therefore hath decreed
That to his city none through me should come
He in all parts hath sway there rules there holds
His citadel and throne O happy those
Whom there he chooses I to him in few
Bard by that God whom thou didst not adore
I do beseech thee that this ill and worse
I may escape to lead me where thou saidst
That I Saint Peters gate may view and those
Who as thou tellst are in such dismal plight
 Onward he movd I close his steps pursud



CANTO II

NOW was the day departing and the air
Imbrownd with shadows from their toils releasd
All animals on earth and I alone
Prepard myself the conflict to sustain
Both of sad pity and that perilous road
Which my unerring memory shall retrace
 O Muses O high genius now vouchsafe
Your aid O mind that all I saw hast kept
Safe in a written record here thy worth
And eminent endowments come to proof
 I thus began Bard thou who art my guide
Consider well if virtue be in me
Sufficient ere to this high enterprise
Thou trust me Thou hast told that Silvius sire
Yet clothd in corruptible flesh among
Th immortal tribes had entrance and was there
Sensible present Yet if heavens great Lord
Almighty foe to ill such favour shewd
In contemplation of the high effect
Both what and who from him should issue forth
It seems in reasons judgment well deservd
Sith he of Rome and of Romes empire wide
In heavens empyreal height was chosen sire
Both which if truth be spoken were ordaind
And stablishd for the holy place where sits
Who to great Peters sacred chair succeeds
He from this journey in thy song renownd
Learnd things that to his victory gave rise
And to the papal robe In aftertimes
The chosen vessel also traveld there
To bring us back assurance in that faith
Which is the entrance to salvations way
But I why should I there presume or who
Permits it not Aeneas I nor Paul
Myself I deem not worthy and none else
Will deem me I if on this voyage then
I venture fear it will in folly end
Thou who art wise better my meaning knowst
Than I can speak As one who unresolves
What he hath late resolvd and with new thoughts
Changes his purpose from his first intent
Removd een such was I on that dun coast
Wasting in thought my enterprise at first
So eagerly embracd If right thy words
I scan replied that shade magnanimous
Thy soul is by vile fear assaild which oft
So overcasts a man that he recoils
From noblest resolution like a beast
At some false semblance in the twilight gloom
That from this terror thou mayst free thyself
I will instruct thee why I came and what
I heard in that same instant when for thee
Grief touchd me first I was among the tribe
Who rest suspended when a dame so blest
And lovely I besought her to command
Calld me her eyes were brighter than the star
Of day and she with gentle voice and soft
Angelically tund her speech addressd
O courteous shade of Mantua thou whose fame
Yet lives and shall live long as nature lasts
A friend not of my fortune but myself
On the wide desert in his road has met
Hindrance so great that he through fear has turnd
Now much I dread lest he past help have strayd
And I be risn too late for his relief
From what in heaven of him I heard Speed now
And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue
And by all means for his deliverance meet
Assist him So to me will comfort spring
I who now bid thee on this errand forth
Am Beatrice from a place I come

Note Beatrice I use this word as it is
pronounced in the Italian as consisting of four
syllables of which the third is a long one

Revisited with joy Love brought me thence
Who prompts my speech When in my Masters sight
I stand thy praise to him I oft will tell
 She then was silent and I thus began
O Lady by whose influence alone
Mankind excels whatever is containd
Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb
So thy command delights me that to obey
If it were done already would seem late
No need hast thou farther to speak thy will
Yet tell the reason why thou art not loth
To leave that ample space where to return
Thou burnest for this centre here beneath
 She then Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire
I will instruct thee briefly why no dread
Hinders my entrance here Those things alone
Are to be feard whence evil may proceed
None else for none are terrible beside
I am so framd by God thanks to his grace
That any suffrance of your misery
Touches me not nor flame of that fierce fire
Assails me In high heaven a blessed dame
Besides who mourns with such effectual grief
That hindrance which I send thee to remove
That Gods stern judgment to her will inclines
To Lucia calling her she thus bespake
Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid
And I commend him to thee At her word
Sped Lucia of all cruelty the foe
And coming to the place where I abode
Seated with Rachel her of ancient days
She thus addressd me Thou true praise of God
Beatrice why is not thy succour lent
To him who so much lovd thee as to leave
For thy sake all the multitude admires
Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail
Nor mark the death which in the torrent flood
Swoln mightier than a sea him struggling holds
Neer among men did any with such speed
Haste to their profit flee from their annoy
As when these words were spoken I came here
Down from my blessed seat trusting the force
Of thy pure eloquence which thee and all
Who well have markd it into honour brings
 When she had ended her bright beaming eyes
Tearful she turnd aside whereat I felt
Redoubled zeal to serve thee As she willd
Thus am I come I savd thee from the beast
Who thy near way across the goodly mount
Prevented What is this comes oer thee then
Why why dost thou hang back why in thy breast
Harbour vile fear why hast not courage there
And noble daring Since three maids so blest
Thy safety plan een in the court of heaven
And so much certain good my words forebode
 As florets by the frosty air of night
Bent down and closd when day has blanchd their leaves
Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems
So was my fainting vigour new restord
And to my heart such kindly courage ran
That I as one undaunted soon replied
O full of pity she who undertook
My succour and thou kind who didst perform
So soon her true behest With such desire
Thou hast disposd me to renew my voyage
That my first purpose fully is resumd
Lead on one only will is in us both
Thou art my guide my master thou and lord
 So spake I and when he had onward movd
I enterd on the deep and woody way



CANTO III

THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe
Through me you pass into eternal pain
Through me among the people lost for aye
Justice the founder of my fabric movd
To rear me was the task of power divine
Supremest wisdom and primeval love
Before me things create were none save things
Eternal and eternal I endure
All hope abandon ye who enter here
 Such characters in colour dim I markd
Over a portals lofty arch inscribd
Whereat I thus Master these words import
Hard meaning He as one prepard replied
Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave
Here be vile fear extinguishd We are come
Where I have told thee we shall see the souls
To misery doomd who intellectual good
Have lost And when his hand he had stretchd forth
To mine with pleasant looks whence I was cheerd
Into that secret place he led me on
 Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans
Resounded through the air piercd by no star
That een I wept at entering Various tongues
Horrible languages outcries of woe
Accents of anger voices deep and hoarse
With hands together smote that swelld the sounds
Made up a tumult that for ever whirls
Round through that air with solid darkness staind
Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies
 I then with error yet encompassd cried
O master What is this I hear What race
Are these who seem so overcome with woe
 He thus to me This miserable fate
Suffer the wretched souls of those who livd
Without or praise or blame with that ill band
Of angels mixd who nor rebellious provd
Nor yet were true to God but for themselves
Were only From his bounds Heaven drove them forth
Not to impair his lustre nor the depth
Of Hell receives them lest th accursed tribe
Should glory thence with exultation vain
 I then Master what doth aggrieve them thus
That they lament so loud He straight replied
That will I tell thee briefly These of death
No hope may entertain and their blind life
So meanly passes that all other lots
They envy Fame of them the world hath none
Nor suffers mercy and justice scorn them both
Speak not of them but look and pass them by
 And I who straightway lookd beheld a flag
Which whirling ran around so rapidly
That it no pause obtaind and following came
Such a long train of spirits I should neer
Have thought that death so many had despoild
 When some of these I recognizd I saw
And knew the shade of him who to base fear
Yielding abjurd his high estate Forthwith
I understood for certain this the tribe
Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing
And to his foes These wretches who neer lived
Went on in nakedness and sorely stung
By wasps and hornets which bedewd their cheeks
With blood that mixd with tears droppd to their feet
And by disgustful worms was gatherd there
 Then looking farther onwards I beheld
A throng upon the shore of a great stream
Whereat I thus Sir grant me now to know
Whom here we view and whence impelld they seem
So eager to pass oer as I discern
Through the blear light He thus to me in few
This shalt thou know soon as our steps arrive
Beside the woeful tide of Acheron
 Then with eyes downward cast and filld with shame
Fearing my words offensive to his ear
Till we had reachd the river I from speech
Abstaind And lo toward us in a bark
Comes on an old man hoary white with eld
Crying Woe to you wicked spirits hope not
Ever to see the sky again I come
To take you to the other shore across
Into eternal darkness there to dwell
In fierce heat and in ice And thou who there
Standest live spirit get thee hence and leave
These who are dead But soon as he beheld
I left them not By other way said he
By other haven shalt thou come to shore
Not by this passage thee a nimbler boat
Must carry Then to him thus spake my guide
Charon thyself torment not so t is willd
Where will and power are one ask thou no more
 Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
Of him the boatman oer the livid lake
Around whose eyes glard wheeling flames Meanwhile
Those spirits faint and naked color changd
And gnashd their teeth soon as the cruel words
They heard God and their parents they blasphemd
The human kind the place the time and seed
That did engender them and give them birth
 Then all together sorely wailing drew
To the cursd strand that every man must pass
Who fears not God Charon demoniac form
With eyes of burning coal collects them all
Beckning and each that lingers with his oar
Strikes As fall off the light autumnal leaves
One still another following till the bough
Strews all its honours on the earth beneath
Een in like manner Adams evil brood
Cast themselves one by one down from the shore
Each at a beck as falcon at his call
 Thus go they over through the umberd wave
And ever they on the opposing bank
Be landed on this side another throng
Still gathers Son thus spake the courteous guide
Those who die subject to the wrath of God
All here together come from every clime
And to oerpass the river are not loth
For so heavens justice goads them on that fear
Is turnd into desire Hence neer hath past
Good spirit If of thee Charon complain
Now mayst thou know the import of his words
 This said the gloomy region trembling shook
So terribly that yet with clammy dews
Fear chills my brow The sad earth gave a blast
That lightening shot forth a vermilion flame
Which all my senses conquerd quite and I
Down droppd as one with sudden slumber seizd



CANTO IV

BROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash
Of heavy thunder that I shook myself
As one by main force rousd Risen upright
My rested eyes I movd around and searchd
With fixed ken to know what place it was
Wherein I stood For certain on the brink
I found me of the lamentable vale
The dread abyss that joins a thundrous sound
Of plaints innumerable Dark and deep
And thick with clouds oerspread mine eye in vain
Explord its bottom nor could aught discern
 Now let us to the blind world there beneath
Descend the bard began all pale of look
I go the first and thou shalt follow next
 Then I his alterd hue perceiving thus
How may I speed if thou yieldest to dread
Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt
 He then The anguish of that race below
With pity stains my cheek which thou for fear
Mistakest Let us on Our length of way
Urges to haste Onward this said he movd
And entring led me with him on the bounds
Of the first circle that surrounds th abyss
Here as mine ear could note no plaint was heard
Except of sighs that made th eternal air
Tremble not causd by tortures but from grief
Felt by those multitudes many and vast
Of men women and infants Then to me
The gentle guide Inquirst thou not what spirits
Are these which thou beholdest Ere thou pass
Farther I would thou know that these of sin
Were blameless and if aught they merited
It profits not since baptism was not theirs
The portal to thy faith If they before
The Gospel livd they servd not God aright
And among such am I For these defects
And for no other evil we are lost
Only so far afflicted that we live
Desiring without hope So grief assaild
My heart at hearing this for well I knew
Suspended in that Limbo many a soul
Of mighty worth O tell me sire reverd
Tell me my master I began through wish
Of full assurance in that holy faith
Which vanquishes all error say did eer
Any or through his own or others merit
Come forth from thence whom afterward was blest
 Piercing the secret purport of my speech
He answerd I was new to that estate
When I beheld a puissant one arrive
Amongst us with victorious trophy crownd
He forth the shade of our first parent drew
Abel his child and Noah righteous man
Of Moses lawgiver for faith approvd
Of patriarch Abraham and David king
Israel with his sire and with his sons
Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won
And others many more whom he to bliss
Exalted Before these be thou assurd
No spirit of human kind was ever savd
 We while he spake ceasd not our onward road
Still passing through the wood for so I name
Those spirits thick beset We were not far
On this side from the summit when I kennd
A flame that oer the darkend hemisphere
Prevailing shind Yet we a little space
Were distant not so far but I in part
Discoverd that a tribe in honour high
That place possessd O thou who every art
And science valust who are these that boast
Such honour separate from all the rest
 He answerd The renown of their great names
That echoes through your world above acquires
Favour in heaven which holds them thus advancd
Meantime a voice I heard Honour the bard
Sublime his shade returns that left us late
No sooner ceasd the sound than I beheld
Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps
Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad
 When thus my master kind began Mark him
Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen
The other three preceding as their lord
This is that Homer of all bards supreme
Flaccus the next in satires vein excelling
The third is Naso Lucan is the last
Because they all that appellation own
With which the voice singly accosted me
Honouring they greet me thus and well they judge
 So I beheld united the bright school
Of him the monarch of sublimest song
That oer the others like an eagle soars
When they together short discourse had held
They turnd to me with salutation kind
Beckning me at the which my master smild
Nor was this all but greater honour still
They gave me for they made me of their tribe
And I was sixth amid so learnd a band
 Far as the luminous beacon on we passd
Speaking of matters then befitting well
To speak now fitter left untold At foot
Of a magnificent castle we arrivd
Seven times with lofty walls begirt and round
Defended by a pleasant stream Oer this
As oer dry land we passd Next through seven gates
I with those sages enterd and we came
Into a mead with lively verdure fresh
 There dwelt a race who slow their eyes around
Majestically movd and in their port
Bore eminent authority they spake
Seldom but all their words were tuneful sweet
 We to one side retird into a place
Open and bright and lofty whence each one
Stood manifest to view Incontinent
There on the green enamel of the plain
Were shown me the great spirits by whose sight
I am exalted in my own esteem
 Electra there I saw accompanied
By many among whom Hector I knew
Anchises pious son and with hawks eye
Caesar all armd and by Camilla there
Penthesilea On the other side
Old King Latinus seated by his child
Lavinia and that Brutus I beheld
Who Tarquin chasd Lucretia Catos wife
Marcia with Julia and Cornelia there
And sole apart retird the Soldan fierce
 Then when a little more I raisd my brow
I spied the master of the sapient throng
Seated amid the philosophic train
Him all admire all pay him revrence due
There Socrates and Plato both I markd
Nearest to him in rank Democritus
Who sets the world at chance Diogenes
With Heraclitus and Empedocles
And Anaxagoras and Thales sage
Zeno and Dioscorides well read
In natures secret lore Orpheus I markd
And Linus Tully and moral Seneca
Euclid and Ptolemy Hippocrates
Galenus Avicen and him who made
That commentary vast Averroes
 Of all to speak at full were vain attempt
For my wide theme so urges that ofttimes
My words fall short of what bechancd In two
The six associates part Another way
My sage guide leads me from that air serene
Into a climate ever vexd with storms
And to a part I come where no light shines



CANTO V

FROM the first circle I descended thus
Down to the second which a lesser space
Embracing so much more of grief contains
Provoking bitter moans There Minos stands
Grinning with ghastly feature he of all
Who enter strict examining the crimes
Gives sentence and dismisses them beneath
According as he foldeth him around
For when before him comes th ill fated soul
It all confesses and that judge severe
Of sins considering what place in hell
Suits the transgression with his tail so oft
Himself encircles as degrees beneath
He dooms it to descend Before him stand
Always a numrous throng and in his turn
Each one to judgment passing speaks and hears
His fate thence downward to his dwelling hurld
 O thou who to this residence of woe
Approachest when he saw me coming cried
Minos relinquishing his dread employ
Look how thou enter here beware in whom
Thou place thy trust let not the entrance broad
Deceive thee to thy harm To him my guide
Wherefore exclaimest Hinder not his way
By destiny appointed so tis willd
Where will and power are one Ask thou no more
 Now gin the rueful wailings to be heard
Now am I come where many a plaining voice
Smites on mine ear Into a place I came
Where light was silent all Bellowing there groand
A noise as of a sea in tempest torn
By warring winds The stormy blast of hell
With restless fury drives the spirits on
Whirld round and dashd amain with sore annoy
When they arrive before the ruinous sweep
There shrieks are heard there lamentations moans
And blasphemies gainst the good Power in heaven
 I understood that to this torment sad
The carnal sinners are condemnd in whom
Reason by lust is swayd As in large troops
And multitudinous when winter reigns
The starlings on their wings are borne abroad
So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls
On this side and on that above below
It drives them hope of rest to solace them
Is none nor een of milder pang As cranes
Chanting their dolrous notes traverse the sky
Stretchd out in long array so I beheld
Spirits who came loud wailing hurried on
By their dire doom Then I Instructor who
Are these by the black air so scourgd The first
Mong those of whom thou questionst he replied
Oer many tongues was empress She in vice
Of luxury was so shameless that she made
Liking be lawful by promulgd decree
To clear the blame she had herself incurrd
This is Semiramis of whom tis writ
That she succeeded Ninus her espousd
And held the land which now the Soldan rules
The next in amorous fury slew herself
And to Sicheus ashes broke her faith
Then follows Cleopatra lustful queen
 There markd I Helen for whose sake so long
The time was fraught with evil there the great
Achilles who with love fought to the end
Paris I saw and Tristan and beside
A thousand more he showd me and by name
Pointed them out whom love bereavd of life
 When I had heard my sage instructor name
Those dames and knights of antique days oerpowerd
By pity wellnigh in amaze my mind
Was lost and I began Bard willingly
I would address those two together coming
Which seem so light before the wind He thus
Note thou when nearer they to us approach
Then by that love which carries them along
Entreat and they will come Soon as the wind
Swayd them toward us I thus framd my speech
O wearied spirits come and hold discourse
With us if by none else restraind As doves
By fond desire invited on wide wings
And firm to their sweet nest returning home
Cleave the air wafted by their will along
Thus issud from that troop where Dido ranks
They through the ill air speeding with such force
My cry prevaild by strong affection urgd
 O gracious creature and benign who gost
Visiting through this element obscure
Us who the world with bloody stain imbrud
If for a friend the King of all we ownd
Our prayr to him should for thy peace arise
Since thou hast pity on our evil plight
f whatsoeer to hear or to discourse
It pleases thee that will we hear of that
Freely with thee discourse while eer the wind
As now is mute The land that gave me birth
Is situate on the coast where Po descends
To rest in ocean with his sequent streams
 Love that in gentle heart is quickly learnt
Entangled him by that fair form from me
Taen in such cruel sort as grieves me still
Love that denial takes from none belovd
Caught me with pleasing him so passing well
That as thou seest he yet deserts me not
Love brought us to one death Caina waits
The soul who spilt our life Such were their words
At hearing which downward I bent my looks
And held them there so long that the bard cried
What art thou pondring I in answer thus
Alas by what sweet thoughts what fond desire
Must they at length to that ill pass have reachd
 Then turning I to them my speech addressd
And thus began Francesca your sad fate
Even to tears my grief and pity moves
But tell me in the time of your sweet sighs
By what and how love granted that ye knew
Your yet uncertain wishes She replied
No greater grief than to remember days
Of joy when misry is at hand That kens
Thy learnd instructor Yet so eagerly
If thou art bent to know the primal root
From whence our love gat being I will do
As one who weeps and tells his tale One day
For our delight we read of Lancelot
How him love thralld Alone we were and no
Suspicion near us Ofttimes by that reading
Our eyes were drawn together and the hue
Fled from our alterd cheek But at one point
Alone we fell When of that smile we read
The wished smile rapturously kissd
By one so deep in love then he who neer
From me shall separate at once my lips
All trembling kissd The book and writer both
Were loves purveyors In its leaves that day
We read no more While thus one spirit spake
The other waild so sorely that heartstruck
I through compassion fainting seemd not far
From death and like a corpse fell to the ground



CANTO VI

MY sense reviving that erewhile had droopd
With pity for the kindred shades whence grief
Oercame me wholly straight around I see
New torments new tormented souls which way
Soeer I move or turn or bend my sight
In the third circle I arrive of showrs
Ceaseless accursed heavy and cold unchangd
For ever both in kind and in degree
Large hail discolourd water sleety flaw
Through the dun midnight air streamd down amain
Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell
 Cerberus cruel monster fierce and strange
Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog
Over the multitude immersd beneath
His eyes glare crimson black his unctuous beard
His belly large and clawd the hands with which
He tears the spirits flays them and their limbs
Piecemeal disparts Howling there spread as curs
Under the rainy deluge with one side
The other screening oft they roll them round
A wretched godless crew When that great worm
Descried us savage Cerberus he opd
His jaws and the fangs showd us not a limb
Of him but trembled Then my guide his palms
Expanding on the ground thence filled with earth
Raisd them and cast it in his ravenous maw
Een as a dog that yelling bays for food
His keeper when the morsel comes lets fall
His fury bent alone with eager haste
To swallow it so droppd the loathsome cheeks
Of demon Cerberus who thundring stuns
The spirits that they for deafness wish in vain
 We oer the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt
Of the heavy tempest passing set our feet
Upon their emptiness that substance seemd
 They all along the earth extended lay
Save one that sudden raisd himself to sit
Soon as that way he saw us pass O thou
He cried who through the infernal shades art led
Own if again thou knowst me Thou wast framd
Or ere my frame was broken I replied
The anguish thou endurst perchance so takes
Thy form from my remembrance that it seems
As if I saw thee never But inform
Me who thou art that in a place so sad
Art set and in such torment that although
Other be greater more disgustful none
Can be imagind He in answer thus
Thy city heapd with envy to the brim
Ay that the measure overflows its bounds
Held me in brighter days Ye citizens
Were wont to name me Ciacco For the sin
Of gluttny damned vice beneath this rain
Een as thou seest I with fatigue am worn
Nor I sole spirit in this woe all these
Have by like crime incurrd like punishment
 No more he said and I my speech resumd
Ciacco thy dire affliction grieves me much
Even to tears But tell me if thou knowst
What shall at length befall the citizens
Of the divided city whether any just one
Inhabit there and tell me of the cause
Whence jarring discord hath assaild it thus
 He then After long striving they will come
To blood and the wild party from the woods
Will chase the other with much injury forth
Then it behoves that this must fall within
Three solar circles and the other rise
By borrowd force of one who under shore
Now rests It shall a long space hold aloof
Its forehead keeping under heavy weight
The other oppressd indignant at the load
And grieving sore The just are two in number
But they neglected Avrice envy pride
Three fatal sparks have set the hearts of all
On fire Here ceasd the lamentable sound
And I continud thus Still would I learn
More from thee farther parley still entreat
Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say
They who so well deservd of Giacopo
Arrigo Mosca and the rest who bent
Their minds on working good Oh tell me where
They bide and to their knowledge let me come
For I am pressd with keen desire to hear
If heavens sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell
Be to their lip assignd He answerd straight
These are yet blacker spirits Various crimes
Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss
If thou so far descendest thou mayst see them
But to the pleasant world when thou returnst
Of me make mention I entreat thee there
No more I tell thee answer thee no more
 This said his fixed eyes he turnd askance
A little eyd me then bent down his head
And midst his blind companions with it fell
 When thus my guide No more his bed he leaves
Ere the last angeltrumpet blow The Power
Adverse to these shall then in glory come
Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair
Resume his fleshly vesture and his form
And hear the eternal doom reechoing rend
The vault So passd we through that mixture foul
Of spirits and rain with tardy steps meanwhile
Touching though slightly on the life to come
For thus I questiond Shall these tortures Sir
When the great sentence passes be increasd
Or mitigated or as now severe
 He then Consult thy knowledge that decides
That as each thing to more perfection grows
It feels more sensibly both good and pain
Though neer to true perfection may arrive
This race accursd yet nearer then than now
They shall approach it Compassing that path
Circuitous we journeyed and discourse
Much more than I relate between us passd
Till at the point where the steps led below
Arrivd there Plutus the great foe we found



CANTO VII

AH me O Satan Satan loud exclaimd
Plutus in accent hoarse of wild alarm
And the kind sage whom no event surprisd
To comfort me thus spake Let not thy fear
Harm thee for power in him be sure is none
To hinder down this rock thy safe descent
Then to that sworn lip turning  Peace he cried
Cursd wolf thy fury inward on thyself
Prey and consume thee Through the dark profound
Not without cause he passes So t is willd
On high there where the great Archangel pourd
Heavns vengeance on the first adulterer proud
 As sails full spread and bellying with the wind
Drop suddenly collapsd if the mast split
So to the ground down droppd the cruel fiend
 Thus we descending to the fourth steep ledge
Gaind on the dismal shore that all the woe
Hems in of all the universe Ah me
Almighty Justice in what store thou heapst
New pains new troubles as I here beheld
Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this
 Een as a billow on Charybdis rising
Against encounterd billow dashing breaks
Such is the dance this wretched race must lead
Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found
From one side and the other with loud voice
Both rolld on weights by main forge of their breasts
Then smote together and each one forthwith
Rolld them back voluble turning again
Exclaiming these Why holdest thou so fast
Those answering And why castest thou away
So still repeating their despiteful song
They to the opposite point on either hand
Traversd the horrid circle then arrivd
Both turnd them round and through the middle space
Conflicting met again At sight whereof
I stung with grief thus spake O say my guide
What race is this Were these whose heads are shorn
On our left hand all seprate to the church
 He straight replied In their first life these all
In mind were so distorted that they made
According to due measure of their wealth
No use This clearly from their words collect
Which they howl forth at each extremity
Arriving of the circle where their crime
Contrary in kind disparts them To the church
Were separate those that with no hairy cowls
Are crownd both Popes and Cardinals oer whom
Avrice dominion absolute maintains
 I then Mid such as these some needs must be
Whom I shall recognize that with the blot
Of these foul sins were staind He answering thus
Vain thought conceivst thou That ignoble life
Which made them vile before now makes them dark
And to all knowledge indiscernible
Forever they shall meet in this rude shock
These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise
Those with closeshaven locks That ill they gave
And ill they kept hath of the beauteous world
Deprivd and set them at this strife which needs
No labourd phrase of mine to set if off
Now mayst thou see my son how brief how vain
The goods committed into fortunes hands
For which the human race keep such a coil
Not all the gold that is beneath the moon
Or ever hath been of these toilworn souls
Might purchase rest for one I thus rejoind
 My guide of thee this also would I learn
This fortune that thou speakst of what it is
Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world
 He thus O beings blind what ignorance
Besets you Now my judgment hear and mark
He whose transcendent wisdom passes all
The heavens creating gave them ruling powers
To guide them so that each part shines to each
Their light in equal distribution pourd
By similar appointment he ordaind
Over the worlds bright images to rule
Superintendence of a guiding hand
And general minister which at due time
May change the empty vantages of life
From race to race from one to others blood
Beyond prevention of mans wisest care
Wherefore one nation rises into sway
Another languishes een as her will
Decrees from us conceald as in the grass
The serpent train Against her nought avails
Your utmost wisdom She with foresight plans
Judges and carries on her reign as theirs
The other powers divine Her changes know
Nore intermission by necessity
She is made swift so frequent come who claim
Succession in her favours This is she
So execrated een by those whose debt
To her is rather praise they wrongfully
With blame requite her and with evil word
But she is blessed and for that recks not
Amidst the other primal beings glad
Rolls on her sphere and in her bliss exults
Now on our way pass we to heavier woe
Descending for each star is falling now
That mounted at our entrance and forbids
Too long our tarrying We the circle crossd
To the next steep arriving at a well
That boiling pours itself down to a foss
Sluicd from its source Far murkier was the wave
Than sablest grain and we in company
Of the inky waters journeying by their side
Enterd though by a different track beneath
Into a lake the Stygian namd expands
The dismal stream when it hath reachd the foot
Of the grey witherd cliffs Intent I stood
To gaze and in the marish sunk descried
A miry tribe all naked and with looks
Betokning rage They with their hands alone
Struck not but with the head the breast the feet
Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs
 The good instructor spake Now seest thou son
The souls of those whom anger overcame
This too for certain know that underneath
The water dwells a multitude whose sighs
Into these bubbles make the surface heave
As thine eye tells thee wheresoeer it turn
Fixd in the slime they say Sad once were we
In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun
Carrying a foul and lazy mist within
Now in these murky settlings are we sad
Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats
But word distinct can utter none Our route
Thus compassd we a segment widely stretchd
Between the dry embankment and the core
Of the loathd pool turning meanwhile our eyes
Downward on those who gulpd its muddy lees
Nor stoppd till to a towers low base we came



CANTO VIII

MY theme pursuing I relate that ere
We reachd the lofty turrets base our eyes
Its height ascended where two cressets hung
We markd and from afar another light
Return the signal so remote that scarce
The eye could catch its beam I turning round
To the deep source of knowledge thus inquird
Say what this means and what that other light
In answer set what agency doth this
 There on the filthy waters he replied
Een now what next awaits us mayst thou see
If the marshgenderd fog conceal it not
 Never was arrow from the cord dismissd
That ran its way so nimbly through the air
As a small bark that through the waves I spied
Toward us coming under the sole sway
Of one that ferried it who cried aloud
Art thou arrivd fell spiritPhlegyas Phlegyas
This time thou criest in vain my lord replied
No longer shalt thou have us but while oer
The slimy pool we pass As one who hears
Of some great wrong he hath sustaind whereat
Inly he pines so Phlegyas inly pind
In his fierce ire My guide descending steppd
Into the skiff and bade me enter next
Close at his side nor till my entrance seemd
The vessel freighted Soon as both embarkd
Cutting the waves goes on the ancient prow
More deeply than with others it is wont
 While we our course oer the dead channel held
One drenchd in mire before me came and said
Who art thou that thou comest ere thine hour
 I answerd Though I come I tarry not
But who art thou that art become so foul
 One as thou seest who mourn  he straight replied
 To which I thus  In mourning and in woe
Cursd spirit tarry thou I know thee well
Een thus in filth disguisd Then stretchd he forth
Hands to the bark whereof my teacher sage
Aware thrusting him back Away down there
To the other dogs then with his arms my neck
Encircling kissd my cheek and spake O soul
Justly disdainful blest was she in whom
Thou was conceivd He in the world was one
For arrogance noted to his memory
No virtue lends its lustre even so
Here is his shadow furious There above
How many now hold themselves mighty kings
Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire
Leaving behind them horrible dispraise
 I then Master him fain would I behold
Whelmd in these dregs before we quit the lake
 He thus Or ever to thy view the shore
Be offerd satisfied shall be that wish
Which well deserves completion Scarce his words
Were ended when I saw the miry tribes
Set on him with such violence that yet
For that render I thanks to God and praise
To Filippo Argenti cried they all
And on himself the moody Florentine
Turnd his avenging fangs Him here we left
Nor speak I of him more But on mine ear
Sudden a sound of lamentation smote
Whereat mine eye unbarrd I sent abroad
 And thus the good instructor Now my son
Draws near the city that of Dis is namd
With its grave denizens a mighty throng
 I thus The minarets already Sir
There certes in the valley I descry
Gleaming vermilion as if they from fire
Had issud He replied Eternal fire
That inward burns shows them with ruddy flame
Illumd as in this nether hell thou seest
 We came within the fosses deep that moat
This region comfortless The walls appeard
As they were framd of iron We had made
Wide circuit ere a place we reachd where loud
The mariner cried vehement Go forth
The entrance is here Upon the gates I spied
More than a thousand who of old from heaven
Were hurld With ireful gestures Who is this
They cried that without death first felt goes through
The regions of the dead My sapient guide
Made sign that he for secret parley wishd
Whereat their angry scorn abating thus
They spake Come thou alone and let him go
Who hath so hardily enterd this realm
Alone return he by his witless way
If well he know it let him prove For thee
Here shalt thou tarry who through clime so dark
Hast been his escort Now bethink thee reader
What cheer was mine at sound of those cursd words
I did believe I never should return
 O my lovd guide who more than seven times
Security hast renderd me and drawn
From peril deep whereto I stood exposd
Desert me not I cried in this extreme
And if our onward going be denied
Together trace we back our steps with speed
 My liege who thither had conducted me
Replied Fear not for of our passage none
Hath power to disappoint us by such high
Authority permitted But do thou
Expect me here meanwhile thy wearied spirit
Comfort and feed with kindly hope assurd
I will not leave thee in this lower world
 This said departs the sire benevolent
And quits me Hesitating I remain
At war twixt will and will not in my thoughts
 I could not hear what terms he offerd them
But they conferrd not long for all at once
To trial fled within Closd were the gates
By those our adversaries on the breast
Of my liege lord excluded he returnd
To me with tardy steps Upon the ground
His eyes were bent and from his brow erasd
All confidence while thus with sighs he spake
Who hath denied me these abodes of woe
Then thus to me That I am angerd think
No ground of terror in this trial I
Shall vanquish use what arts they may within
For hindrance This their insolence not new
Erewhile at gate less secret they displayd
Which still is without bolt upon its arch
Thou sawst the deadly scroll and even now
On this side of its entrance down the steep
Passing the circles unescorted comes
One whose strong might can open us this land



CANTO IX

THE hue which coward dread on my pale cheeks
Imprinted when I saw my guide turn back
Chasd that from his which newly they had worn
And inwardly restraind it He as one
Who listens stood attentive for his eye
Not far could lead him through the sable air
And the thickgathring cloud It yet behooves
We win this fightthus he began if not
Such aid to us is offerd Oh how long
Me seems it ere the promisd help arrive
 I noted how the sequel of his words
Clokd their beginning for the last he spake
Agreed not with the first But not the less
My fear was at his saying sith I drew
To import worse perchance than that he held
His mutilated speech Doth ever any
Into this rueful concaves extreme depth
Descend out of the first degree whose pain
Is deprivation merely of sweet hope
 Thus I inquiring Rarely he replied
It chances that among us any makes
This journey which I wend Erewhile tis true
Once came I here beneath conjurd by fell
Erictho sorceress who compelld the shades
Back to their bodies No long space my flesh
Was naked of me when within these walls
She made me enter to draw forth a spirit
From out of Judas circle Lowest place
Is that of all obscurest and removd
Farthest from heavns allcircling orb The road
Full well I know thou therefore rest secure
That lake the noisome stench exhaling round
The city of grief encompasses which now
We may not enter without rage Yet more
He added but I hold it not in mind
For that mine eye toward the lofty tower
Had drawn me wholly to its burning top
Where in an instant I beheld uprisen
At once three hellish furies staind with blood
In limb and motion feminine they seemd
Around them greenest hydras twisting rolld
Their volumes adders and cerastes crept
Instead of hair and their fierce temples bound
 He knowing well the miserable hags
Who tend the queen of endless woe thus spake
Mark thou each dire Erinnys To the left
This is Megaera on the right hand she
Who wails Alecto and Tisiphone
I th midst This said in silence he remaind
Their breast they each one clawing tore themselves
Smote with their palms and such shrill clamour raisd
That to the bard I clung suspicionbound
Hasten Medusa so to adamant
Him shall we change all looking down exclaimd
Een when by Theseus might assaild we took
No ill revenge Turn thyself round and keep
Thy countnance hid for if the Gorgon dire
Be shown and thou shouldst view it thy return
Upwards would be for ever lost This said
Himself my gentle master turnd me round
Nor trusted he my hands but with his own
He also hid me Ye of intellect
Sound and entire mark well the lore conceald
Under close texture of the mystic strain
 And now there came oer the perturbed waves
Loudcrashing terrible a sound that made
Either shore tremble as if of a wind
Impetuous from conflicting vapours sprung
That gainst some forest driving all its might
Plucks off the branches beats them down and hurls
Afar then onward passing proudly sweeps
Its whirlwind rage while beasts and shepherds fly
 Mine eyes he loosd and spake And now direct
Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam
There thickest where the smoke ascends As frogs
Before their foe the serpent through the wave
Ply swiftly all till at the ground each one
Lies on a heap more than a thousand spirits
Destroyd so saw I fleeing before one
Who passd with unwet feet the Stygian sound
He from his face removing the gross air
Oft his left hand forth stretchd and seemd alone
By that annoyance wearied I perceivd
That he was sent from heavn and to my guide
Turnd me who signal made that I should stand
Quiet and bend to him Ah me how full
Of noble anger seemd he To the gate
He came and with his wand touchd it whereat
Open without impediment it flew
 Outcasts of heavn O abject race and scornd
Began he on the horrid grunsel standing
Whence doth this wild excess of insolence
Lodge in you wherefore kick you gainst that will
Neer frustrate of its end and which so oft
Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs
What profits at the fays to but the horn
Your Cerberus if ye remember hence
Bears still peeld of their hair his throat and maw
 This said he turnd back oer the filthy way
And syllable to us spake none but wore
The semblance of a man by other care
Beset and keenly pressd than thought of him
Who in his presence stands Then we our steps
Toward that territory movd secure
After the hallowd words We unopposd
There enterd and my mind eager to learn
What state a fortress like to that might hold
I soon as enterd throw mine eye around
And see on every part widestretching space
Replete with bitter pain and torment ill
 As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles
Or as at Pola near Quarnaros gulf
That closes Italy and laves her bounds
The place is all thick spread with sepulchres
So was it here save what in horror here
Excelld for midst the graves were scattered flames
Wherewith intensely all throughout they burnd
That iron for no craft there hotter needs
 Their lids all hung suspended and beneath
From them forth issud lamentable moans
Such as the sad and torturd well might raise
 I thus Master say who are these interrd
Within these vaults of whom distinct we hear
The dolorous sighs He answer thus returnd
 The archheretics are here accompanied
By every sect their followers and much more
Than thou believest tombs are freighted like
With like is buried and the monuments
Are different in degrees of heat This said
He to the right hand turning on we passd
Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high



CANTO X

NOW by a secret pathway we proceed
Between the walls that hem the region round
And the tormented souls my master first
I close behind his steps Virtue supreme
I thus began who through these ample orbs
In circuit leadst me even as thou willst
Speak thou and satisfy my wish May those
Who lie within these sepulchres be seen
Already all the lids are raisd and none
Oer them keeps watch He thus in answer spake
They shall be closed all whattime they here
From Josaphat returnd shall come and bring
Their bodies which above they now have left
The cemetery on this part obtain
With Epicurus all his followers
Who with the body make the spirit die
Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon
Both to the question askd and to the wish
Which thou concealst in silence I replied
I keep not guide belovd from thee my heart
Secreted but to shun vain length of words
A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself
 O Tuscan thou who through the city of fire
Alive art passing so discreet of speech
Here please thee stay awhile Thy utterance
Declares the place of thy nativity
To be that noble land with which perchance
I too severely dealt Sudden that sound
Forth issud from a vault whereat in fear
I somewhat closer to my leaders side
Approaching he thus spake What dost thou Turn
Lo Farinata there who hath himself
Uplifted from his girdle upwards all
Exposd behold him On his face was mine
Already fixd his breast and forehead there
Erecting seemd as in high scorn he held
Een hell Between the sepulchres to him
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt
This warning added See thy words be clear
 He soon as there I stood at the tombs foot
Eyd me a space then in disdainful mood
Addressd me Say what ancestors were thine
 I willing to obey him straight reveald
The whole nor kept back aught whence he his brow
Somewhat uplifting cried Fiercely were they
Adverse to me my party and the blood
From whence I sprang twice therefore I abroad
Scatterd them Though drivn out yet they each time
From all parts answerd I returnd an art
Which yours have shown they are not skilld to learn
 Then peering forth from the unclosed jaw
Rose from his side a shade high as the chin
Leaning methought upon its knees upraisd
It lookd around as eager to explore
If there were other with me but perceiving
That fond imagination quenchd with tears
Thus spake If thou through this blind prison gost
Led by thy lofty genius and profound
Where is my son and wherefore not with thee
 I straight replied Not of myself I come
By him who there expects me through this clime
Conducted whom perchance Guido thy son
Had in contempt Already had his words
And mode of punishment read me his name
Whence I so fully answerd He at once
Exclaimd up starting How saidst thou he HAD
No longer lives he Strikes not on his eye
The blessed daylight Then of some delay
I made ere my reply aware down fell
Supine not after forth appeard he more
 Meanwhile the other great of soul near whom
I yet was stationd changd not countnance stern
Nor movd the neck nor bent his ribbed side
And if continuing the first discourse
They in this art he cried small skill have shown
That doth torment me more een than this bed
But not yet fifty times shall be relumd
Her aspect who reigns here Queen of this realm
Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art
So to the pleasant world mayst thou return
As thou shalt tell me why in all their laws
Against my kin this people is so fell
 The slaughter and great havoc I replied
That colourd Arbias flood with crimson stain
To these impute that in our hallowd dome
Such orisons ascend Sighing he shook
The head then thus resumd In that affray
I stood not singly nor without just cause
Assuredly should with the rest have stirrd
But singly there I stood when by consent
Of all Florence had to the ground been razd
The one who openly forbad the deed
 So may thy lineage find at last repose
I thus adjurd him as thou solve this knot
Which now involves my mind If right I hear
Ye seem to view beforehand that which time
Leads with him of the present uninformd
 We view as one who hath an evil sight
He answerd plainly objects far remote
So much of his large spendour yet imparts
The Almighty Ruler but when they approach
Or actually exist our intellect
Then wholly fails nor of your human state
Except what others bring us know we aught
Hence therefore mayst thou understand that all
Our knowledge in that instant shall expire
When on futurity the portals close
 Then conscious of my fault and by remorse
Smitten I added thus Now shalt thou say
To him there fallen that his offspring still
Is to the living joind and bid him know
That if from answer silent I abstaind
Twas that my thought was occupied intent
Upon that error which thy help hath solvd
 But now my master summoning me back
I heard and with more eager haste besought
The spirit to inform me who with him
Partook his lot He answer thus returnd
 More than a thousand with me here are laid
Within is Frederick second of that name
And the Lord Cardinal and of the rest
I speak not He this said from sight withdrew
But I my steps towards the ancient bard
Reverting ruminated on the words
Betokening me such ill Onward he movd
And thus in going questiond Whence the amaze
That holds thy senses wrapt I satisfied
The inquiry and the sage enjoind me straight
Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard
To thee importing harm and note thou this
With his raisd finger bidding me take heed
 When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam
Whose bright eye all surveys she of thy life
The future tenour will to thee unfold
 Forthwith he to the left hand turnd his feet
We left the wall and towrds the middle space
Went by a path that to a valley strikes
Which een thus high exhald its noisome steam



CANTO XI

UPON the utmost verge of a high bank
By craggy rocks environd round we came
Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stowd
And here to shun the horrible excess
Of fetid exhalation upward cast
From the profound abyss behind the lid
Of a great monument we stood retird
Whereon this scroll I markd I have in charge
Pope Anastasius whom Photinus drew
From the right pathEre our descent behooves
We make delay that somewhat first the sense
To the dire breath accustomd afterward
Regard it not My master thus to whom
Answering I spake Some compensation find
That the time past not wholly lost He then
Lo how my thoughts een to thy wishes tend
My son within these rocks he thus began
Are three close circles in gradation placd
As these which now thou leavst Each one is full
Of spirits accursd but that the sight alone
Hereafter may suffice thee listen how
And for what cause in durance they abide
 Of all malicious act abhorrd in heaven
The end is injury and all such end
Either by force or fraud works others woe
But fraud because of man peculiar evil
To God is more displeasing and beneath
The fraudulent are therefore doomd to endure
Severer pang The violent occupy
All the first circle and because to force
Three persons are obnoxious in three rounds
Hach within other seprate is it framd
To God his neighbour and himself by man
Force may be offerd to himself I say
And his possessions as thou soon shalt hear
At full Death violent death and painful wounds
Upon his neighbour he inflicts and wastes
By devastation pillage and the flames
His substance Slayers and each one that smites
In malice plundrers and all robbers hence
The torment undergo of the first round
In different herds Man can do violence
To himself and his own blessings and for this
He in the second round must aye deplore
With unavailing penitence his crime
Whoeer deprives himself of life and light
In reckless lavishment his talent wastes
And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy
To God may force be offerd in the heart
Denying and blaspheming his high power
And nature with her kindly law contemning
And thence the inmost round marks with its seal
Sodom and Cahors and all such as speak
Contemptuously of the Godhead in their hearts
 Fraud that in every conscience leaves a sting
May be by man employd on one whose trust
He wins or on another who withholds
Strict confidence Seems as the latter way
Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes
Whence in the second circle have their nest
Dissimulation witchcraft flatteries
Theft falsehood simony all who seduce
To lust or set their honesty at pawn
With such vile scum as these The other way
Forgets both Natures general love and that
Which thereto added afterwards gives birth
To special faith Whence in the lesser circle
Point of the universe dread seat of Dis
The traitor is eternally consumd
 I thus Instructor clearly thy discourse
Proceeds distinguishing the hideous chasm
And its inhabitants with skill exact
But tell me this they of the dull fat pool
Whom the rain beats or whom the tempest drives
Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet
Wherefore within the city fireillumd
Are not these punishd if Gods wrath be on them
And if it be not wherefore in such guise
Are they condemned He answer thus returnd
Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind
Not so accustomd or what other thoughts
Possess it Dwell not in thy memory
The words wherein thy ethic page describes
Three dispositions adverse to Heavns will
Incontnence malice and mad brutishness
And how incontinence the least offends
God and least guilt incurs If well thou note
This judgment and remember who they are
Without these walls to vain repentance doomd
Thou shalt discern why they apart are placd
From these fell spirits and less wreakful pours
Justice divine on them its vengeance down
 O Sun who healest all imperfect sight
Thou so contentst me when thou solvst my doubt
That ignorance not less than knowledge charms
Yet somewhat turn thee back I in these words
Continud where thou saidst that usury
Offends celestial Goodness and this knot
Perplexd unravel He thus made reply
Philosophy to an attentive ear
Clearly points out not in one part alone
How imitative nature takes her course
From the celestial mind and from its art
And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds
Not many leaves scannd oer observing well
Thou shalt discover that your art on her
Obsequious follows as the learner treads
In his instructors step so that your art
Deserves the name of second in descent
From God These two if thou recall to mind
Creations holy book from the beginning
Were the right source of life and excellence
To human kind But in another path
The usurer walks and Nature in herself
And in her follower thus he sets at nought
Placing elsewhere his hope But follow now
My steps on forward journey bent for now
The Pisces play with undulating glance
Along the horizon and the Wain lies all
Oer the northwest and onward there a space
Is our steep passage down the rocky height



CANTO XII

THE place where to descend the precipice
We came was rough as Alp and on its verge
Such object lay as every eye would shun
 As is that ruin which Adices stream
On this side Trento struck shouldring the wave
Or loosd by earthquake or for lack of prop
For from the mountains summit whence it movd
To the low level so the headlong rock
Is shiverd that some passage it might give
To him who from above would pass een such
Into the chasm was that descent and there
At point of the disparted ridge lay stretchd
The infamy of Crete detested brood
Of the feignd heifer and at sight of us
It gnawd itself as one with rage distract
To him my guide exclaimd Perchance thou deemst
The King of Athens here who in the world
Above thy death contrivd Monster avaunt
He comes not tutord by thy sisters art
But to behold your torments is he come
 Like to a bull that with impetuous spring
Darts at the moment when the fatal blow
Hath struck him but unable to proceed
Plunges on either side so saw I plunge
The Minotaur whereat the sage exclaimd
Run to the passage while he storms t is well
That thou descend Thus down our road we took
Through those dilapidated crags that oft
Movd underneath my feet to weight like theirs
Unusd I pondring went and thus he spake
 Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruind steep
Guarded by the brute violence which I
Have vanquishd now Know then that when I erst
Hither descended to the nether hell
This rock was not yet fallen But past doubt
If well I mark not long ere He arrived
Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil
Of the highest circle then through all its bounds
Such trembling seizd the deep concave and foul
I thought the universe was thrilld with love
Whereby there are who deem the world hath oft
Been into chaos turnd and in that point
Here and elsewhere that old rock toppled down
But fix thine eyes beneath the river of blood
Approaches in the which all those are steepd
Who have by violence injurd O blind lust
O foolish wrath who so dost goad us on
In the brief life and in the eternal then
Thus miserably oerwhelm us I beheld
An ample foss that in a bow was bent
As circling all the plain for so my guide
Had told Between it and the ramparts base
On trail ran Centaurs with keen arrows armd
As to the chase they on the earth were wont
 At seeing us descend they each one stood
And issuing from the troop three sped with bows
And missile weapons chosen first of whom
One cried from far Say to what pain ye come
Condemnd who down this steep have journied Speak
From whence ye stand or else the bow I draw
 To whom my guide Our answer shall be made
To Chiron there when nearer him we come
Ill was thy mind thus ever quick and rash
 Then me he touchd and spake Nessus is this
Who for the fair Deianira died
And wrought himself revenge for his own fate
He in the midst that on his breast looks down
Is the great Chiron who Achilles nursd
That other Pholus prone to wrath Around
The foss these go by thousands aiming shafts
At whatsoever spirit dares emerge
From out the blood more than his guilt allows
 We to those beasts that rapid strode along
Drew near when Chiron took an arrow forth
And with the notch pushd back his shaggy beard
To the cheekbone then his great mouth to view
Exposing to his fellows thus exclaimd
Are ye aware that he who comes behind
Moves what he touches The feet of the dead
Are not so wont My trusty guide who now
Stood near his breast where the two natures join
Thus made reply He is indeed alive
And solitary so must needs by me
Be shown the gloomy vale thereto inducd
By strict necessity not by delight
She left her joyful harpings in the sky
Who this new office to my care consignd
He is no robber no dark spirit I
But by that virtue which empowers my step
To treat so wild a path grant us I pray
One of thy band whom we may trust secure
Who to the ford may lead us and convey
Across him mounted on his back for he
Is not a spirit that may walk the air
 Then on his right breast turning Chiron thus
To Nessus spake Return and be their guide
And if ye chance to cross another troop
Command them keep aloof Onward we movd
The faithful escort by our side along
The border of the crimsonseething flood
Whence from those steepd within loud shrieks arose
 Some there I markd as high as to their brow
Immersd of whom the mighty Centaur thus
These are the souls of tyrants who were given
To blood and rapine Here they wail aloud
Their merciless wrongs Here Alexander dwells
And Dionysius fell who many a year
Of woe wrought for fair Sicily That brow
Whereon the hair so jetty clustring hangs
Is Azzolino that with flaxen locks
Obizzo of Este in the world destroyd
By his foul stepson To the bard reverd
I turned me round and thus he spake Let him
Be to thee now first leader me but next
To him in rank Then farther on a space
The Centaur pausd near some who at the throat
Were extant from the wave and showing us
A spirit by itself apart retird
Exclaimd He in Gods bosom smote the heart
Which yet is honourd on the bank of Thames
 A race I next espied who held the head
And even all the bust above the stream
Midst these I many a face rememberd well
Thus shallow more and more the blood became
So that at last it but imbrud the feet
And there our passage lay athwart the foss
 As ever on this side the boiling wave
Thou seest diminishing the Centaur said
So on the other be thou well assurd
It lower still and lower sinks its bed
Till in that part it reuniting join
Where t is the lot of tyranny to mourn
There Heavns stern justice lays chastising hand
On Attila who was the scourge of earth
On Sextus and on Pyrrhus and extracts
Tears ever by the seething flood unlockd
From the Rinieri of Corneto this
Pazzo the other namd who filld the ways
With violence and war This said he turnd
And quitting us alone repassd the ford



CANTO XIII

ERE Nessus yet had reachd the other bank
We enterd on a forest where no track
Of steps had worn a way Not verdant there
The foliage but of dusky hue not light
The boughs and tapering but with knares deformd
And matted thick fruits there were none but thorns
Instead with venom filld Less sharp than these
Less intricate the brakes wherein abide
Those animals that hate the culturd fields
Betwixt Corneto and Cecinas stream
 Here the brute Harpies make their nest the same
Who from the Strophades the Trojan band
Drove with dire boding of their future woe
Broad are their pennons of the human form
Their neck and countnance armd with talons keen
The feet and the huge belly fledge with wings
These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood
 The kind instructor in these words began
Ere farther thou proceed know thou art now
I th second round and shalt be till thou come
Upon the horrid sand look therefore well
Around thee and such things thou shalt behold
As would my speech discredit On all sides
I heard sad plainings breathe and none could see
From whom they might have issud In amaze
Fast bound I stood He as it seemd believd
That I had thought so many voices came
From some amid those thickets close conceald
And thus his speech resumd If thou lop off
A single twig from one of those ill plants
The thought thou hast conceivd shall vanish quite
 Thereat a little stretching forth my hand
From a great wilding gatherd I a branch
And straight the trunk exclaimd Why pluckst thou me
Then as the dark blood trickled down its side
These words it added Wherefore tearst me thus
Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast
Men once were we that now are rooted here
Thy hand might well have spard us had we been
The souls of serpents As a brand yet green
That burning at one end from the other sends
A groaning sound and hisses with the wind
That forces out its way so burst at once
Forth from the broken splinter words and blood
 I letting fall the bough remaind as one
Assaild by terror and the sage replied
If he O injurd spirit could have believd
What he hath seen but in my verse describd
He never against thee had stretchd his hand
But I because the thing surpassd belief
Prompted him to this deed which even now
Myself I rue But tell me who thou wast
That for this wrong to do thee some amends
In the upper world for thither to return
Is granted him thy fame he may revive
 That pleasant word of thine the trunk replied
Hath so inveigled me that I from speech
Cannot refrain wherein if I indulge
A little longer in the snare detaind
Count it not grievous I it was who held
Both keys to Fredericks heart and turnd the wards
Opening and shutting with a skill so sweet
That besides me into his inmost breast
Scarce any other could admittance find
The faith I bore to my high charge was such
It cost me the lifeblood that warmd my veins
The harlot who neer turnd her gloating eyes
From Caesars household common vice and pest
Of courts gainst me inflamd the minds of all
And to Augustus they so spread the flame
That my glad honours changd to bitter woes
My soul disdainful and disgusted sought
Refuge in death from scorn and I became
Just as I was unjust toward myself
By the new roots which fix this stem I swear
That never faith I broke to my liege lord
Who merited such honour and of you
If any to the world indeed return
Clear he from wrong my memory that lies
Yet prostrate under envys cruel blow
 First somewhat pausing till the mournful words
Were ended then to me the bard began
Lose not the time but speak and of him ask
If more thou wish to learn Whence I replied
Question thou him again of whatsoeer
Will as thou thinkst content me for no power
Have I to ask such pity is at my heart
 He thus resumd So may he do for thee
Freely what thou entreatest as thou yet
Be pleasd imprisond Spirit to declare
How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied
And whether any ever from such frame
Be loosend if thou canst that also tell
 Thereat the trunk breathd hard and the wind soon
Changd into sounds articulate like these
 Briefly ye shall be answerd When departs
The fierce soul from the body by itself
Thence torn asunder to the seventh gulf
By Minos doomd into the wood it falls
No place assignd but wheresoever chance
Hurls it there sprouting as a grain of spelt
It rises to a sapling growing thence
A savage plant The Harpies on its leaves
Then feeding cause both pain and for the pain
A vent to grief We as the rest shall come
For our own spoils yet not so that with them
We may again be clad for what a man
Takes from himself it is not just he have
Here we perforce shall drag them and throughout
The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung
Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade
 Attentive yet to listen to the trunk
We stood expecting farther speech when us
A noise surprisd as when a man perceives
The wild boar and the hunt approach his place
Of stationd watch who of the beasts and boughs
Loud rustling round him hears And lo there came
Two naked torn with briers in headlong flight
That they before them broke each fan o th wood
Haste now the foremost cried now haste thee death
The other as seemd impatient of delay
Exclaiming Lano not so bent for speed
Thy sinews in the lists of Toppos field
And then for that perchance no longer breath
Sufficd him of himself and of a bush
One group he made Behind them was the wood
Full of black female mastiffs gaunt and fleet
As greyhounds that have newly slippd the leash
On him who squatted down they stuck their fangs
And having rent him piecemeal bore away
The torturd limbs My guide then seizd my hand
And led me to the thicket which in vain
Mournd through its bleeding wounds O Giacomo
Of Sant Andrea what avails it thee
It cried that of me thou hast made thy screen
For thy ill life what blame on me recoils
 When oer it he had pausd my master spake
Say who wast thou that at so many points
Breathst out with blood thy lamentable speech
 He answerd Oh ye spirits arrivd in time
To spy the shameful havoc that from me
My leaves hath severd thus gather them up
And at the foot of their sad parenttree
Carefully lay them In that city I dwelt
Who for the Baptist her first patron changd
Whence he for this shall cease not with his art
To work her woe and if there still remaind not
On Arnos passage some faint glimpse of him
Those citizens who reard once more her walls
Upon the ashes left by Attila
Had labourd without profit of their toil
I slung the fatal noose from my own roof



CANTO XIV

SOON as the charity of native land
Wrought in my bosom I the scatterd leaves
Collected and to him restord who now
Was hoarse with uttrance To the limit thence
We came which from the third the second round
Divides and where of justice is displayd
Contrivance horrible Things then first seen
Clearlier to manifest I tell how next
A plain we reachd that from its sterile bed
Each plant repelld The mournful wood waves round
Its garland on all sides as round the wood
Spreads the sad foss There on the very edge
Our steps we stayd It was an area wide
Of arid sand and thick resembling most
The soil that erst by Catos foot was trod
 Vengeance of Heavn Oh  how shouldst thou be feard
By all who read what here my eyes beheld
 Of naked spirits many a flock I saw
All weeping piteously to different laws
Subjected for on the earth some lay supine
Some crouching close were seated others pacd
Incessantly around the latter tribe
More numerous those fewer who beneath
The torment lay but louder in their grief
 Oer all the sand fell slowly wafting down
Dilated flakes of fire as flakes of snow
On Alpine summit when the wind is hushd
As in the torrid Indian clime the son
Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band
Descending solid flames that to the ground
Came down whence he bethought him with his troop
To trample on the soil for easier thus
The vapour was extinguishd while alone
So fell the eternal fiery flood wherewith
The marble glowd underneath as under stove
The viands doubly to augment the pain
Unceasing was the play of wretched hands
Now this now that way glancing to shake off
The heat still falling fresh I thus began
Instructor thou who all things overcomst
Except the hardy demons that rushd forth
To stop our entrance at the gate say who
Is yon huge spirit that as seems heeds not
The burning but lies writhen in proud scorn
As by the sultry tempest immaturd
 Straight he himself who was aware I askd
My guide of him exclaimd Such as I was
When living dead such now I am If Jove
Weary his workman out from whom in ire
He snatchd the lightnings that at my last day
Transfixd me if the rest be weary out
At their black smithy labouring by turns
In Mongibello while he cries aloud
Help help good Mulciber as erst he cried
In the Phlegraean warfare and the bolts
Launch he full aimd at me with all his might
He never should enjoy a sweet revenge
 Then thus my guide in accent higher raisd
Than I before had heard him Capaneus
Thou art more punishd in that this thy pride
Lives yet unquenchd no torrent save thy rage
Were to thy fury pain proportiond full
 Next turning round to me with milder lip
He spake This of the seven kings was one
Who girt the Theban walls with siege and held
As still he seems to hold God in disdain
And sets his high omnipotence at nought
But as I told him his despiteful mood
Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it
Follow me now and look thou set not yet
Thy foot in the hot sand but to the wood
Keep ever close Silently on we passd
To where there gushes from the forests bound
A little brook whose crimsond wave yet lifts
My hair with horror As the rill that runs
From Bulicame to be portiond out
Among the sinful women so ran this
Down through the sand its bottom and each bank
Stonebuilt and either margin at its side
Whereon I straight perceivd our passage lay
 Of all that I have shown thee since that gate
We enterd first whose threshold is to none
Denied nought else so worthy of regard
As is this river has thine eye discernd
Oer which the flaming volley all is quenchd
 So spake my guide and I him thence besought
That having givn me appetite to know
The food he too would give that hunger cravd
 In midst of ocean forthwith he began
A desolate country lies which Crete is namd
Under whose monarch in old times the world
Livd pure and chaste A mountain rises there
Calld Ida joyous once with leaves and streams
Deserted now like a forbidden thing
It was the spot which Rhea Saturns spouse
Chose for the secret cradle of her son
And better to conceal him drownd in shouts
His infant cries Within the mount upright
An ancient form there stands and huge that turns
His shoulders towards Damiata and at Rome
As in his mirror looks Of finest gold
His head is shapd pure silver are the breast
And arms thence to the middle is of brass
And downward all beneath welltemperd steel
Save the right foot of potters clay on which
Than on the other more erect he stands
Each part except the gold is rent throughout
And from the fissure tears distil which joind
Penetrate to that cave They in their course
Thus far precipitated down the rock
Form Acheron and Styx and Phlegethon
Then by this straitend channel passing hence
Beneath een to the lowest depth of all
Form there Cocytus of whose lake thyself
Shall see it I here give thee no account
 Then I to him If from our world this sluice
Be thus derivd wherefore to us but now
Appears it at this edge He straight replied
The place thou knowst is round and though great part
Thou have already passd still to the left
Descending to the nethermost not yet
Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb
Wherefore if aught of new to us appear
It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks
 Then I again inquird Where flow the streams
Of Phlegethon and Lethe for of one
Thou tellst not and the other of that shower
Thou sayst is formd He answer thus returnd
Doubtless thy questions all well pleasd I hear
Yet the red seething wave might have resolvd
One thou proposest Lethe thou shalt see
But not within this hollow in the place
Whither to lave themselves the spirits go
Whose blame hath been by penitence removd
He added Time is now we quit the wood
Look thou my steps pursue the margins give
Safe passage unimpeded by the flames
For over them all vapour is extinct



CANTO XV

One of the solid margins bears us now
Envelopd in the mist that from the stream
Arising hovers oer and saves from fire
Both piers and water As the Flemings rear
Their mound twixt Ghent and Bruges to chase back
The ocean fearing his tumultuous tide
That drives toward them or the Paduans theirs
Along the Brenta to defend their towns
And castles ere the genial warmth be felt
On Chiarentanas top such were the mounds
So framd though not in height or bulk to these
Made equal by the master whosoeer
He was that raisd them here We from the wood
Were not so far removd that turning round
I might not have discernd it when we met
A troop of spirits who came beside the pier
 They each one eyd us as at eventide
One eyes another under a new moon
And toward us sharpend their sight as keen
As an old tailor at his needles eye
 Thus narrowly explord by all the tribe
I was agnizd of one who by the skirt
Caught me and cried What wonder have we here
 And I when he to me outstretchd his arm
Intently fixd my ken on his parchd looks
That although smirchd with fire they hinderd not
But I rememberd him and towards his face
My hand inclining answerd Sir Brunetto
And art thou here He thus to me My son
Oh let it not displease thee if Brunetto
Latini but a little space with thee
Turn back and leave his fellows to proceed
 I thus to him replied Much as I can
I thereto pray thee and if thou be willing
That I here seat me with thee I consent
His leave with whom I journey first obtaind
 O son said he  whoever of this throng
One instant stops lies then a hundred years
No fan to ventilate him when the fire
Smites sorest Pass thou therefore on I close
Will at thy garments walk and then rejoin
My troop who go mourning their endless doom
 I dard not from the path descend to tread
On equal ground with him but held my head
Bent down as one who walks in reverent guise
 What chance or destiny thus be began
Ere the last day conducts thee here below
And who is this that shows to thee the way
 There up aloft I answerd in the life
Serene I wanderd in a valley lost
Before mine age had to its fullness reachd
But yestermorn I left it then once more
Into that vale returning him I met
And by this path homeward he leads me back
 If thou he answerd follow but thy star
Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven
Unless in fairer days my judgment errd
And if my fate so early had not chancd
Seeing the heavns thus bounteous to thee I
Had gladly givn thee comfort in thy work
But that ungrateful and malignant race
Who in old times came down from Fesole
Ay and still smack of their rough mountainflint
Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity
Nor wonder for amongst illsavourd crabs
It suits not the sweet figtree lay her fruit
Old fame reports them in the world for blind
Covetous envious proud Look to it well
Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways For thee
Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve
That thou by either party shalt be cravd
With hunger keen but be the fresh herb far
From the goats tooth The herd of Fesole
May of themselves make litter not touch the plant
If any such yet spring on their rank bed
In which the holy seed revives transmitted
From those true Romans who still there remaind
When it was made the nest of so much ill
 Were all my wish fulfilld I straight replied
Thou from the confines of mans nature yet
Hadst not been driven forth for in my mind
Is fixd and now strikes full upon my heart
The dear benign paternal image such
As thine was when so lately thou didst teach me
The way for man to win eternity
And how I prizd the lesson it behooves
That long as life endures my tongue should speak
What of my fate thou tellst that write I down
And with another text to comment on
For her I keep it the celestial dame
Who will know all if I to her arrive
This only would I have thee clearly note
That so my conscience have no plea against me
Do fortune as she list I stand prepard
Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear
Speed fortune then her wheel as likes her best
The clown his mattock all things have their course
 Thereat my sapient guide upon his right
Turnd himself back then lookd at me and spake
He listens to good purpose who takes note
 I not the less still on my way proceed
Discoursing with Brunetto and inquire
Who are most known and chief among his tribe
 To know of some is well thus he replied
But of the rest silence may best beseem
Time would not serve us for report so long
In brief I tell thee that all these were clerks
Men of great learning and no less renown
By one same sin polluted in the world
With them is Priscian and Accorsos son
Francesco herds among that wretched throng
And if the wish of so impure a blotch
Possessd thee him thou also mightst have seen
Who by the servants servant was transferrd
From Arnos seat to Bacchiglione where
His illstraind nerves he left I more would add
But must from farther speech and onward way
Alike desist for yonder I behold
A mist newrisen on the sandy plain
A company with whom I may not sort
Approaches I commend my TREASURE to thee
Wherein I yet survive my sole request
 This said he turnd and seemd as one of those
Who oer Veronas champain try their speed
For the green mantle and of them he seemd
Not he who loses but who gains the prize



CANTO XVI

NOW came I where the waters din was heard
As down it fell into the other round
Resounding like the hum of swarming bees
When forth together issud from a troop
That passd beneath the fierce tormenting storm
Three spirits running swift They towards us came
And each one cried aloud Oh do thou stay
Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem
To be some inmate of our evil land
 Ah me what wounds I markd upon their limbs
Recent and old inflicted by the flames
Een the remembrance of them grieves me yet
 Attentive to their cry my teacher pausd
And turnd to me his visage and then spake
Wait now our courtesy these merit well
And were t not for the nature of the place
Whence glide the fiery darts I should have said
That haste had better suited thee than them
 They when we stoppd resumd their ancient wail
And soon as they had reachd us all the three
Whirld round together in one restless wheel
As naked champions smeard with slippery oil
Are wont intent to watch their place of hold
And vantage ere in closer strife they meet
Thus each one as he wheeld his countenance
At me directed so that opposite
The neck movd ever to the twinkling feet
 If misery of this drear wilderness
Thus one began added to our sad cheer
And destitute do call forth scorn on us
And our entreaties let our great renown
Incline thee to inform us who thou art
That dost imprint with living feet unharmd
The soil of Hell He in whose track thou seest
My steps pursuing naked though he be
And reft of all was of more high estate
Than thou believest grandchild of the chaste
Gualdrada him they Guidoguerra calld
Who in his lifetime many a noble act
Achievd both by his wisdom and his sword
The other next to me that beats the sand
Is Aldobrandi name deserving well
In the upper world of honour and myself
Who in this torment do partake with them
Am Rusticucci whom past doubt my wife
Of savage temper more than aught beside
Hath to this evil brought If from the fire
I had been shelterd down amidst them straight
I then had cast me nor my guide I deem
Would have restraind my going but that fear
Of the dire burning vanquishd the desire
Which made me eager of their wishd embrace
 I then began Not scorn but grief much more
Such as long time alone can cure your doom
Fixd deep within me soon as this my lord
Spake words whose tenour taught me to expect
That such a race as ye are was at hand
I am a countryman of yours who still
Affectionate have utterd and have heard
Your deeds and names renownd Leaving the gall
For the sweet fruit I go that a sure guide
Hath promisd to me But behooves that far
As to the centre first I downward tend
 So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs
He answer straight returnd and so thy fame
Shine bright when thou art gone as thou shalt tell
If courtesy and valour as they wont
Dwell in our city or have vanishd clean
For one amidst us late condemnd to wail
Borsiere yonder walking with his peers
Grieves us no little by the news he brings
 An upstart multitude and sudden gains
Pride and excess O Florence have in thee
Engenderd so that now in tears thou mournst
Thus cried I with my face upraisd and they
All three who for an answer took my words
Lookd at each other as men look when truth
Comes to their ear If thou at other times
They all at once rejoind so easily
Satisfy those who question happy thou
Gifted with words so apt to speak thy thought
Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime
Returning to behold the radiant stars
When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past
See that of us thou speak among mankind
 This said they broke the circle and so swift
Fled that as pinions seemd their nimble feet
 Not in so short a time might one have said
Amen as they had vanishd Straight my guide
Pursud his track I followd and small space
Had we passd onward when the waters sound
Was now so near at hand that we had scarce
Heard one anothers speech for the loud din
 Een as the river that holds on its course
Unmingled from the mount of Vesulo
On the left side of Apennine toward
The east which Acquacheta higher up
They call ere it descend into the vale
At Forli by that name no longer known
Rebellows oer Saint Benedict rolld on
From the Alpine summit down a precipice
Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads
Thus downward from a craggy steep we found
That this dark wave resounded roaring loud
So that the ear its clamour soon had stunnd
 I had a cord that bracd my girdle round
Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take
The painted leopard This when I had all
Unloosend from me so my master bade
I gatherd up and stretchd it forth to him
Then to the right he turnd and from the brink
Standing few paces distant cast it down
Into the deep abyss And somewhat strange
Thus to myself I spake signal so strange
Betokens which my guide with earnest eye
Thus follows Ah what caution must men use
With those who look not at the deed alone
But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill
 Quickly shall come he said what I expect
Thine eye discover quickly that whereof
Thy thought is dreaming Ever to that truth
Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears
A man if possible should bar his lip
Since although blameless he incurs reproach
But silence here were vain and by these notes
Which now I sing reader I swear to thee
So may they favour find to latest times
That through the gross and murky air I spied
A shape come swimming up that might have quelld
The stoutest heart with wonder in such guise
As one returns who hath been down to loose
An anchor grappled fast against some rock
Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies
Who upward springing close draws in his feet



CANTO XVII

LO the fell monster with the deadly sting
Who passes mountains breaks through fenced walls
And firm embattled spears and with his filth
Taints all the world Thus me my guide addressd
And beckond him that he should come to shore
Near to the stony causeways utmost edge
 Forthwith that image vile of fraud appeard
His head and upper part exposd on land
But laid not on the shore his bestial train
His face the semblance of a just mans wore
So kind and gracious was its outward cheer
The rest was serpent all two shaggy claws
Reachd to the armpits and the back and breast
And either side were painted oer with nodes
And orbits Colours variegated more
Nor Turks nor Tartars eer on cloth of state
With interchangeable embroidery wove
Nor spread Arachne oer her curious loom
As ofttimes a light skiff moord to the shore
Stands part in water part upon the land
Or as where dwells the greedy German boor
The beaver settles watching for his prey
So on the rim that fencd the sand with rock
Sat perchd the fiend of evil In the void
Glancing his tail upturnd its venomous fork
With sting like scorpions armd Then thus my guide
Now need our way must turn few steps apart
Far as to that ill beast who couches there
 Thereat toward the right our downward course
We shapd and better to escape the flame
And burning marle ten paces on the verge
Proceeded Soon as we to him arrive
A little further on mine eye beholds
A tribe of spirits seated on the sand
Near the wide chasm Forthwith my master spake
That to the full thy knowledge may extend
Of all this round contains go now and mark
The mien these wear but hold not long discourse
Till thou returnest I with him meantime
Will parley that to us he may vouchsafe
The aid of his strong shoulders Thus alone
Yet forward on the extremity I pacd
Of that seventh circle where the mournful tribe
Were seated At the eyes forth gushd their pangs
Against the vapours and the torrid soil
Alternately their shifting hands they plied
Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply
Their jaws and feet by turns when bitten sore
By gnats or flies or gadflies swarming round
 Noting the visages of some who lay
Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire
One of them all I knew not but perceivd
That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch
With colours and with emblems various markd
On which it seemd as if their eye did feed
 And when amongst them looking round I came
A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought
That wore a lions countenance and port
Then still my sight pursuing its career
Another I beheld than blood more red
A goose display of whiter wing than curd
And one who bore a fat and azure swine
Picturd on his white scrip addressed me thus
What dost thou in this deep Go now and know
Since yet thou livest that my neighbour here
Vitaliano on my left shall sit
A Paduan with these Florentines am I
Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears exclaiming
O haste that noble knight he who the pouch
With the three beaks will bring This said he writhd
The mouth and lolld the tongue out like an ox
That licks his nostrils I lest longer stay
He ill might brook who bade me stay not long
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turnd
 My guide already seated on the haunch
Of the fierce animal I found and thus
He me encouragd Be thou stout be bold
Down such a steep flight must we now descend
Mount thou before for that no power the tail
May have to harm thee I will be i th midst
 As one who hath an ague fit so near
His nails already are turnd blue and he
Quivers all oer if he but eye the shade
Such was my cheer at hearing of his words
But shame soon interposd her threat who makes
The servant bold in presence of his lord
 I settled me upon those shoulders huge
And would have said but that the words to aid
My purpose came not Look thou clasp me firm
 But he whose succour then not first I provd
Soon as I mounted in his arms aloft
Embracing held me up and thus he spake
Geryon now move thee be thy wheeling gyres
Of ample circuit easy thy descent
Think on th unusual burden thou sustainst
 As a small vessel backning out from land
Her station quits so thence the monster loosd
And when he felt himself at large turnd round
There where the breast had been his forked tail
Thus like an eel outstretchd at length he steerd
Gathring the air up with retractile claws
 Not greater was the dread when Phaeton
The reins let drop at random whence high heaven
Whereof signs yet appear was wrapt in flames
Nor when illfated Icarus perceivd
By liquefaction of the scalded wax
The trusted pennons loosend from his loins
His sire exclaiming loud Ill way thou keepst
Than was my dread when round me on each part
The air I viewd and other object none
Save the fell beast He slowly sailing wheels
His downward motion unobservd of me
But that the wind arising to my face
Breathes on me from below Now on our right
I heard the cataract beneath us leap
With hideous crash whence bending down to explore
New terror I conceivd at the steep plunge
For flames I saw and wailings smote mine ear
So that all trembling close I crouchd my limbs
And then distinguishd unperceivd before
By the dread torments that on every side
Drew nearer how our downward course we wound
 As falcon that hath long been on the wing
But lure nor bird hath seen while in despair
The falconer cries Ah me thou stoopst to earth
Wearied descends and swiftly down the sky
In many an orbit wheels then lighting sits
At distance from his lord in angry mood
So Geryon lighting places us on foot
Low down at base of the deepfurrowd rock
And of his burden there dischargd forthwith
Sprang forward like an arrow from the string



CANTO XVIII

THERE is a place within the depths of hell
Calld Malebolge all of rock darkstaind
With hue ferruginous een as the steep
That round it circling winds Right in the midst
Of that abominable region yawns
A spacious gulf profound whereof the frame
Due time shall tell The circle that remains
Throughout its round between the gulf and base
Of the high craggy banks successive forms
Ten trenches in its hollow bottom sunk
 As where to guard the walls full many a foss
Begirds some stately castle sure defence
Affording to the space within so here
Were modeld these and as like fortresses
Een from their threshold to the brink without
Are flankd with bridges from the rocks low base
Thus flinty paths advancd that cross the moles
And dikes struck onward far as to the gulf
That in one bound collected cuts them off
Such was the place wherein we found ourselves
From Geryons back dislodgd The bard to left
Held on his way and I behind him movd
 On our right hand new misery I saw
New pains new executioners of wrath
That swarming peopled the first chasm Below
Were naked sinners Hitherward they came
Meeting our faces from the middle point
With us beyond but with a larger stride
Een thus the Romans when the year returns
Of Jubilee with better speed to rid
The thronging multitudes their means devise
For such as pass the bridge that on one side
All front toward the castle and approach
Saint Peters fane on th other towards the mount
 Each divers way along the grisly rock
Hornd demons I beheld with lashes huge
That on their back unmercifully smote
Ah how they made them bound at the first stripe
None for the second waited nor the third
 Meantime as on I passd one met my sight
Whom soon as viewd Of him cried I not yet
Mine eye hath had his fill With fixed gaze
I therefore scannd him Straight the teacher kind
Pausd with me and consented I should walk
Backward a space and the tormented spirit
Who thought to hide him bent his visage down
But it availd him nought for I exclaimd
Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground
Unless thy features do belie thee much
Venedico art thou But what brings thee
Into this bitter seasning  He replied
Unwillingly I answer to thy words
But thy clear speech that to my mind recalls
The world I once inhabited constrains me
Know then twas I who led fair Ghisola
To do the Marquis will however fame
The shameful tale have bruited Nor alone
Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn
Rather with us the place is so oerthrongd
That not so many tongues this day are taught
Betwixt the Reno and Savenas stream
To answer SIPA in their countrys phrase
And if of that securer proof thou need
Remember but our craving thirst for gold
 Him speaking thus a demon with his thong
Struck and exclaimd Away corrupter here
Women are none for sale Forthwith I joind
My escort and few paces thence we came
To where a rock forth issued from the bank
That easily ascended to the right
Upon its splinter turning we depart
From those eternal barriers When arrivd
Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass
The scourged souls Pause here the teacher said
And let these others miserable now
Strike on thy ken faces not yet beheld
For that together they with us have walkd
 From the old bridge we eyd the pack who came
From th other side towards us like the rest
Excoriate from the lash My gentle guide
By me unquestiond thus his speech resumd
Behold that lofty shade who this way tends
And seems too woebegone to drop a tear
How yet the regal aspect he retains
Jason is he whose skill and prowess won
The ram from Colchos To the Lemnian isle
His passage thither led him when those bold
And pitiless women had slain all their males
There he with tokens and fair witching words
Hypsipyle beguild a virgin young
Who first had all the rest herself beguild
Impregnated he left her there forlorn
Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain
Here too Medeas injries are avenged
All bear him company who like deceit
To his have practisd And thus much to know
Of the first vale suffice thee and of those
Whom its keen torments urge Now had we come
Where crossing the next pier the straightend path
Bestrides its shoulders to another arch
 Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts
Who jibber in low melancholy sounds
With widestretchd nostrils snort and on themselves
Smite with their palms Upon the banks a scurf
From the foul steam condensd encrusting hung
That held sharp combat with the sight and smell
 So hollow is the depth that from no part
Save on the summit of the rocky span
Could I distinguish aught Thus far we came
And thence I saw within the foss below
A crowd immersd in ordure that appeard
Draff of the human body There beneath
Searching with eye inquisitive I markd
One with his head so grimd t were hard to deem
If he were clerk or layman Loud he cried
Why greedily thus bendest more on me
Than on these other filthy ones thy ken
 Because if true my memry I replied
I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks
And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung
Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more
 Then beating on his brain these words he spake
Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk
Wherewith I neer enough could glut my tongue
 My leader thus A little further stretch
Thy face that thou the visage well mayst note
Of that besotted sluttish courtezan
Who there doth rend her with defiled nails
Now crouching down now risen on her feet
Thais is this the harlot whose false lip
Answerd her doting paramour that askd
Thankest me muchSay rather wondrously
And seeing this here satiate be our view



CANTO XIX

WOE to thee Simon Magus woe to you
His wretched followers who the things of God
Which should be wedded unto goodness them
Rapacious as ye are do prostitute
For gold and silver in adultery
Now must the trumpet sound for you since yours
Is the third chasm Upon the following vault
We now had mounted where the rock impends
Directly oer the centre of the foss
 Wisdom Supreme how wonderful the art
Which thou dost manifest in heaven in earth
And in the evil world how just a meed
Allotting by thy virtue unto all
 I saw the livid stone throughout the sides
And in its bottom full of apertures
All equal in their width and circular each
Nor ample less nor larger they appeard
Than in Saint Johns fair dome of me belovd
Those framd to hold the pure baptismal streams
One of the which I brake some few years past
To save a whelming infant and be this
A seal to undeceive whoever doubts
The motive of my deed From out the mouth
Of every one emergd a sinners feet
And of the legs high upward as the calf
The rest beneath was hid On either foot
The soles were burning whence the flexile joints
Glancd with such violent motion as had snapt
Asunder cords or twisted withs As flame
Feeding on unctuous matter glides along
The surface scarcely touching where it moves
So here from heel to point glided the flames
 Master say who is he than all the rest
Glancing in fiercer agony on whom
A ruddier flame doth prey I thus inquird
 If thou be willing he replied that I
Carry thee down where least the slope bank falls
He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs
 I then As pleases thee to me is best
Thou art my lord and knowst that neer I quit
Thy will what silence hides that knowest thou
Thereat on the fourth pier we came we turnd
And on our left descended to the depth
A narrow strait and perforated close
Nor from his side my leader set me down
Till to his orifice he brought whose limb
Quivring expressd his pang Whoeer thou art
Sad spirit thus reversd and as a stake
Drivn in the soil I in these words began
If thou be able utter forth thy voice
 There stood I like the friar that doth shrive
A wretch for murder doomd who een when fixd
Calleth him back whence death awhile delays
 He shouted Ha already standest there
Already standest there O Boniface
By many a year the writing playd me false
So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth
For which thou fearedst not in guile to take
The lovely lady and then mangle her
 I felt as those who piercing not the drift
Of answer made them stand as if exposd
In mockery nor know what to reply
When Virgil thus admonishd Tell him quick
I am not he not he whom thou believst
 And I as was enjoind me straight replied
 That heard the spirit all did wrench his feet
And sighing next in woeful accent spake
What then of me requirest If to know
So much imports thee who I am that thou
Hast therefore down the bank descended learn
That in the mighty mantle I was robd
And of a shebear was indeed the son
So eager to advance my whelps that there
My having in my purse above I stowd
And here myself Under my head are draggd
The rest my predecessors in the guilt
Of simony Stretchd at their length they lie
Along an opening in the rock Midst them
I also low shall fall soon as he comes
For whom I took thee when so hastily
I questiond But already longer time
Hath passd since my souls kindled and I thus
Upturnd have stood than is his doom to stand
Planted with fiery feet For after him
One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive
From forth the west a shepherd without law
Fated to cover both his form and mine
He a new Jason shall be calld of whom
In Maccabees we read and favour such
As to that priest his king indulgent showd
Shall be of Frances monarch shown to him
 I know not if I here too far presumd
But in this strain I answerd Tell me now
What treasures from St Peter at the first
Our Lord demanded when he put the keys
Into his charge Surely he askd no more
But Follow me Nor Peter nor the rest
Or gold or silver of Matthias took
When lots were cast upon the forfeit place
Of the condemned soul Abide thou then
Thy punishment of right is merited
And look thou well to that illgotten coin
Which against Charles thy hardihood inspird
If reverence of the keys restraind me not
Which thou in happier time didst hold I yet
Severer speech might use Your avarice
Oercasts the world with mourning under foot
Treading the good and raising bad men up
Of shepherds like to you th Evangelist
Was ware when her who sits upon the waves
With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld
She who with seven heads towerd at her birth
And from ten horns her proof of glory drew
Long as her spouse in virtue took delight
Of gold and silver ye have made your god
Diffring wherein from the idolater
But he that worships one a hundred ye
Ah Constantine to how much ill gave birth
Not thy conversion but that plenteous dower
Which the first wealthy Father gaind from thee
 Meanwhile as thus I sung he whether wrath
Or conscience smote him violent upsprang
Spinning on either sole I do believe
My teacher well was pleasd with so composd
A lip he listend ever to the sound
Of the true words I utterd In both arms
He caught and to his bosom lifting me
Upward retracd the way of his descent
 Nor weary of his weight he pressd me close
Till to the summit of the rock we came
Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier
His cherishd burden there gently he placd
Upon the rugged rock and steep a path
Not easy for the clambring goat to mount
 Thence to my view another vale appeard



CANTO XX

AND now the verse proceeds to torments new
Fit argument of this the twentieth strain
Of the first song whose awful theme records
The spirits whelmd in woe Earnest I lookd
Into the depth that opend to my view
Moistend with tears of anguish and beheld
A tribe that came along the hollow vale
In silence weeping such their step as walk
Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth
 As on them more direct mine eye descends
Each wondrously seemd to be reversd
At the neckbone so that the countenance
Was from the reins averted and because
None might before him look they were compelld
To advance with backward gait Thus one perhaps
Hath been by force of palsy clean transposd
But I neer saw it nor believe it so
 Now reader think within thyself so God
Fruit of thy reading give thee how I long
Could keep my visage dry when I beheld
Near me our form distorted in such guise
That on the hinder parts falln from the face
The tears downstreaming rolld Against a rock
I leant and wept so that my guide exclaimd
What and art thou too witless as the rest
Here pity most doth show herself alive
When she is dead What guilt exceedeth his
Who with Heavens judgment in his passion strives
Raise up thy head raise up and see the man
Before whose eyes earth gapd in Thebes when all
Cried out Amphiaraus whither rushest
Why leavest thou the war He not the less
Fell ruining far as to Minos down
Whose grapple none eludes Lo how he makes
The breast his shoulders and who once too far
Before him wishd to see now backward looks
And treads reverse his path Tiresias note
Who semblance changd when woman he became
Of male through every limb transformd and then
Once more behovd him with his rod to strike
The two entwining serpents ere the plumes
That markd the better sex might shoot again
 Aruns with rere his belly facing comes
On Lunis mountains midst the marbles white
Where delves Carraras hind who wons beneath
A cavern was his dwelling whence the stars
And mainsea wide in boundless view he held
 The next whose loosend tresses overspread
Her bosom which thou seest not for each hair
On that side grows was Manto she who searchd
Through many regions and at length her seat
Fixd in my native land whence a short space
My words detain thy audience When her sire
From life departed and in servitude
The city dedicate to Bacchus mournd
Long time she went a wandrer through the world
Aloft in Italys delightful land
A lake there lies at foot of that proud Alp
That oer the Tyrol locks Germania in
Its name Benacus which a thousand rills
Methinks and more water between the vale
Camonica and Garda and the height
Of Apennine remote There is a spot
At midway of that lake where he who bears
Of Trentos flock the pastral staff with him
Of Brescia and the Veronese might each
Passing that way his benediction give
A garrison of goodly site and strong
Peschiera stands to awe with front opposd
The Bergamese and Brescian whence the shore
More slope each way descends There whatsoever
Benacus bosom holds not tumbling oer
Down falls and winds a river flood beneath
Through the green pastures Soon as in his course
The steam makes head Benacus then no more
They call the name but Mincius till at last
Reaching Governo into Po he falls
Not far his course hath run when a wide flat
It finds which overstretchmg as a marsh
It covers pestilent in summer oft
Hence journeying the savage maiden saw
Midst of the fen a territory waste
And naked of inhabitants To shun
All human converse here she with her slaves
Plying her arts remaind and livd and left
Her body tenantless Thenceforth the tribes
Who round were scatterd gathring to that place
Assembled for its strength was great enclosd
On all parts by the fen On those dead bones
They reard themselves a city for her sake
Calling it Mantua who first chose the spot
Nor askd another omen for the name
Wherein more numerous the people dwelt
Ere Casalodis madness by deceit
Was wrongd of Pinamonte If thou hear
Henceforth another origin assignd
Of that my country I forewarn thee now
That falsehood none beguile thee of the truth
 I answerd Teacher I conclude thy words
So certain that all else shall be to me
As embers lacking life But now of these
Who here proceed instruct me if thou see
Any that merit more especial note
For thereon is my mind alone intent
 He straight replied That spirit from whose cheek
The beard sweeps oer his shoulders brown what time
Graecia was emptied of her males that scarce
The cradles were supplied the seer was he
In Aulis who with Calchas gave the sign
When first to cut the cable Him they namd
Eurypilus so sings my tragic strain
In which majestic measure well thou knowst
Who knowst it all That other round the loins
So slender of his shape was Michael Scot
Practisd in evry slight of magic wile
 Guido Bonatti see Asdente mark
Who now were willing he had tended still
The thread and cordwain and too late repents
 See next the wretches who the needle left
The shuttle and the spindle and became
Diviners baneful witcheries they wrought
With images and herbs But onward now
For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine
On either hemisphere touching the wave
Beneath the towers of Seville Yesternight
The moon was round Thou mayst remember well
For she good service did thee in the gloom
Of the deep wood This said both onward movd



CANTO XXI

THUS we from bridge to bridge with other talk
The which my drama cares not to rehearse
Passd on and to the summit reaching stood
To view another gap within the round
Of Malebolge other bootless pangs
 Marvelous darkness shadowd oer the place
 In the Venetians arsenal as boils
Through wintry months tenacious pitch to smear
Their unsound vessels for th inclement time
Seafaring men restrains and in that while
His bark one builds anew another stops
The ribs of his that hath made many a voyage
One hammers at the prow one at the poop
This shapeth oars that other cables twirls
The mizen one repairs and mainsail rent
So not by force of fire but art divine
Boild here a glutinous thick mass that round
Limd all the shore beneath I that beheld
But therein nought distinguishd save the surge
Raisd by the boiling in one mighty swell
Heave and by turns subsiding and fall While there
I fixd my ken below Mark mark my guide
Exclaiming drew me towards him from the place
Wherein I stood I turnd myself as one
Impatient to behold that which beheld
He needs must shun whom sudden fear unmans
That he his flight delays not for the view
Behind me I discernd a devil black
That running up advancd along the rock
Ah what fierce cruelty his look bespake
In act how bitter did he seem with wings
Buoyant outstretchd and feet of nimblest tread
His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp
Was with a sinner chargd by either haunch
He held him the foots sinew griping fast
 Ye of our bridge he cried keentalond fiends
Lo one of Santa Zitas elders Him
Whelm ye beneath while I return for more
That land hath store of such All men are there
Except Bonturo barterers of no
For lucre there an aye is quickly made
 Him dashing down oer the rough rock he turnd
Nor ever after thief a mastiff loosd
Sped with like eager haste That other sank
And forthwith writing to the surface rose
But those dark demons shrouded by the bridge
Cried Here the hallowd visage saves not here
Is other swimming than in Serchios wave
Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not
Take heed thou mount not oer the pitch This said
They grappled him with more than hundred hooks
And shouted Coverd thou must sport thee here
So if thou canst in secret mayst thou filch
Een thus the cook bestirs him with his grooms
To thrust the flesh into the caldron down
With fleshhooks that it float not on the top
 Me then my guide bespake Lest they descry
That thou art here behind a craggy rock
Bend low and screen thee and whateer of force
Be offerd me or insult fear thou not
For I am well advisd who have been erst
In the like fray Beyond the bridges head
Therewith he passd and reaching the sixth pier
Behovd him then a forehead terrorproof
 With storm and fury as when dogs rush forth
Upon the poor mans back who suddenly
From whence he standeth makes his suit so rushd
Those from beneath the arch and against him
Their weapons all they pointed He aloud
Be none of you outrageous ere your time
Dare seize me come forth from amongst you one
Who having heard my words decide he then
If he shall tear these limbs They shouted loud
Go Malacoda Whereat one advancd
The others standing firm and as he came
What may this turn avail him he exclaimd
 Believst thou Malacoda I had come
Thus far from all your skirmishing secure
My teacher answered without will divine
And destiny propitious Pass we then
For so Heavens pleasure is that I should lead
Another through this savage wilderness
 Forthwith so fell his pride that he let drop
The instrument of torture at his feet
And to the rest exclaimd We have no power
To strike him Then to me my guide O thou
Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit
Low crouching safely now to me return
 I rose and towards him moved with speed the fiends
Meantime all forward drew me terror seizd
Lest they should break the compact they had made
Thus issuing from Caprona once I saw
Th infantry dreading lest his covenant
The foe should break so close he hemmd them round
 I to my leaders side adherd mine eyes
With fixt and motionless observance bent
On their unkindly visage They their hooks
Protruding one the other thus bespake
Wilt thou I touch him on the hip To whom
Was answerd Even so nor miss thy aim
 But he who was in confrence with my guide
Turnd rapid round and thus the demon spake
Stay stay thee Scarmiglione Then to us
He added Further footing to your step
This rock affords not shiverd to the base
Of the sixth arch But would you still proceed
Up by this cavern go not distant far
Another rock will yield you passage safe
Yesterday later by five hours than now
Twelve hundred threescore years and six had filld
The circuit of their course since here the way
Was broken Thitherward I straight dispatch
Certain of these my scouts who shall espy
If any on the surface bask With them
Go ye for ye shall find them nothing fell
Come Alichino forth with that he cried
And Calcabrina and Cagnazzo thou
The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead
With Libicocco Draghinazzo haste
Fangd Ciriatto Grafflacane fierce
And Farfarello and mad Rubicant
Search ye around the bubbling tar For these
In safety lead them where the other crag
Uninterrupted traverses the dens
 I then O master what a sight is there
Ah without escort journey we alone
Which if thou know the way I covet not
Unless thy prudence fail thee dost not mark
How they do gnarl upon us and their scowl
Threatens us present tortures He replied
I charge thee fear not let them as they will
Gnarl on t is but in token of their spite
Against the souls who mourn in torment steepd
 To leftward oer the pier they turnd but each
Had first between his teeth prest close the tongue
Toward their leader for a signal looking
Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave



CANTO XXII

IT hath been heretofore my chance to see
Horsemen with martial order shifting camp
To onset sallying or in muster rangd
Or in retreat sometimes outstretchd for flight
Lightarmed squadrons and fleet foragers
Scouring thy plains Arezzo have I seen
And clashing tournaments and tilting jousts
Now with the sound of trumpets now of bells
Tabors or signals made from castled heights
And with inventions multiform our own
Or introducd from foreign land but neer
To such a strange recorder I beheld
In evolution moving horse nor foot
Nor ship that tackd by sign from land or star
 With the ten demons on our way we went
Ah fearful company but in the church
With saints with gluttons at the taverns mess
 Still earnest on the pitch I gazd to mark
All things whateer the chasm containd and those
Who burnd within As dolphins that in sign
To mariners heave high their arched backs
That thence forewarnd they may advise to save
Their threatend vessels so at intervals
To ease the pain his back some sinner showd
Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance
 Een as the frogs that of a watry moat
Stand at the brink with the jaws only out
Their feet and of the trunk all else concealed
Thus on each part the sinners stood but soon
As Barbariccia was at hand so they
Drew back under the wave I saw and yet
My heart doth stagger one that waited thus
As it befalls that oft one frog remains
While the next springs away and Graffiacan
Who of the fiends was nearest grappling seizd
His clotted locks and draggd him sprawling up
That he appeard to me an otter Each
Already by their names I knew so well
When they were chosen I observd and markd
How one the other calld O Rubicant
See that his hide thou with thy talons flay
Shouted together all the cursed crew
 Then I Inform thee master if thou may
What wretched soul is this on whom their hand
His foes have laid My leader to his side
Approachd and whence he came inquird to whom
Was answerd thus Born in Navarres domain
My mother placd me in a lords retinue
For she had borne me to a losel vile
A spendthrift of his substance and himself
The good king Thibault after that I servd
To peculating here my thoughts were turnd
Whereof I give account in this dire heat
 Straight Ciriatto from whose mouth a tusk
Issued on either side as from a boar
Ript him with one of these Twixt evil claws
The mouse had falln but Barbariccia cried
Seizing him with both arms Stand thou apart
While I do fix him on my prong transpiercd
Then added turning to my guide his face
Inquire of him if more thou wish to learn
Ere he again be rent My leader thus
Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt
Knowest thou any sprung of Latian land
Under the tarI parted he replied
But now from one who sojournd not far thence
So were I under shelter now with him
Nor hook nor talon then should scare me more
 Too long we suffer Libicocco cried
Then darting forth a prong seizd on his arm
And mangled bore away the sinewy part
Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath
Would next have caught whence angrily their chief
Turning on all sides round with threatning brow
Restraind them When their strife a little ceasd
Of him who yet was gazing on his wound
My teacher thus without delay inquird
Who was the spirit from whom by evil hap
Parting as thou has told thou camst to shore
 It was the friar Gomita he rejoind
He of Gallura vessel of all guile
Who had his masters enemies in hand
And usd them so that they commend him well
Money he took and them at large dismissd
So he reports and in each other charge
Committed to his keeping playd the part
Of barterer to the height with him doth herd
The chief of Logodoro Michel Zanche
Sardinia is a theme whereof their tongue
Is never weary Out alas behold
That other how he grins More would I say
But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore
 Their captain then to Farfarello turning
Who rolld his moony eyes in act to strike
Rebukd him thus Off cursed bird Avaunt
 If ye desire to see or hear he thus
Quaking with dread resumd or Tuscan spirits
Or Lombard I will cause them to appear
Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury
So that no vengeance they may fear from them
And I remaining in this selfsame place
Will for myself but one make sevn appear
When my shrill whistle shall be heard for so
Our custom is to call each other up
 Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinnd
Then waggd the head and spake Hear his device
Mischievous as he is to plunge him down
 Whereto he thus who faild not in rich store
Of nicewove toils  Mischief forsooth extreme
Meant only to procure myself more woe
 No longer Alichino then refraind
But thus the rest gainsaying him bespake
If thou do cast thee down I not on foot
Will chase thee but above the pitch will beat
My plumes Quit we the vantage ground and let
The bank be as a shield that we may see
If singly thou prevail against us all
 Now reader of new sport expect to hear
 They each one turnd his eyes to the other shore
He first who was the hardest to persuade
The spirit of Navarre chose well his time
Planted his feet on land and at one leap
Escaping disappointed their resolve
 Them quick resentment stung but him the most
Who was the cause of failure in pursuit
He therefore sped exclaiming Thou art caught
 But little it availd terror outstrippd
His following flight the other plungd beneath
And he with upward pinion raisd his breast
Een thus the waterfowl when she perceives
The falcon near dives instant down while he
Enragd and spent retires That mockery
In Calcabrina fury stirrd who flew
After him with desire of strife inflamd
And for the barterer had scapd so turnd
His talons on his comrade Oer the dyke
In grapple close they joind but the other provd
A goshawk able to rend well his foe
And in the boiling lake both fell The heat
Was umpire soon between them but in vain
To lift themselves they strove so fast were glued
Their pennons Barbariccia as the rest
That chance lamenting four in flight dispatchd
From the other coast with all their weapons armd
They to their post on each side speedily
Descending stretchd their hooks toward the fiends
Who flounderd inly burning from their scars
And we departing left them to that broil



CANTO XXIII

IN silence and in solitude we went
One first the other following his steps
As minor friars journeying on their road
 The present fray had turnd my thoughts to muse
Upon old Aesops fable where he told
What fate unto the mouse and frog befell
For language hath not sounds more like in sense
Than are these chances if the origin
And end of each be heedfully compard
And as one thought bursts from another forth
So afterward from that another sprang
Which added doubly to my former fear
For thus I reasond These through us have been
So foild with loss and mockry so complete
As needs must sting them sore If anger then
Be to their evil will conjoind more fell
They shall pursue us than the savage hound
Snatches the leveret panting twixt his jaws
 Already I perceivd my hair stand all
On end with terror and lookd eager back
 Teacher I thus began if speedily
Thyself and me thou hide not much I dread
Those evil talons Even now behind
They urge us quick imagination works
So forcibly that I already feel them
 He answerd Were I formd of leaded glass
I should not sooner draw unto myself
Thy outward image than I now imprint
That from within This moment came thy thoughts
Presented before mine with similar act
And countnance similar so that from both
I one design have framd If the right coast
Incline so much that we may thence descend
Into the other chasm we shall escape
Secure from this imagined pursuit
 He had not spoke his purpose to the end
When I from far beheld them with spread wings
Approach to take us Suddenly my guide
Caught me evn as a mother that from sleep
Is by the noise arousd and near her sees
The climbing fires who snatches up her babe
And flies neer pausing careful more of him
Than of herself that but a single vest
Clings round her limbs Down from the jutting beach
Supine he cast him to that pendent rock
Which closes on one part the other chasm
 Never ran water with such hurrying pace
Adown the tube to turn a landmills wheel
When nearest it approaches to the spokes
As then along that edge my master ran
Carrying me in his bosom as a child
Not a companion Scarcely had his feet
Reachd to the lowest of the bed beneath
When over us the steep they reachd but fear
In him was none for that high Providence
Which placd them ministers of the fifth foss
Power of departing thence took from them all
 There in the depth we saw a painted tribe
Who pacd with tardy steps around and wept
Faint in appearance and oercome with toil
Caps had they on with hoods that fell low down
Before their eyes in fashion like to those
Worn by the monks in Cologne Their outside
Was overlaid with gold dazzling to view
But leaden all within and of such weight
That Fredericks compard to these were straw
Oh everlasting wearisome attire
 We yet once more with them together turnd
To leftward on their dismal moan intent
But by the weight oppressd so slowly came
The fainting people that our company
Was changd at every movement of the step
 Whence I my guide addressd See that thou find
Some spirit whose name may by his deeds be known
And to that end look round thee as thou gost
 Then one who understood the Tuscan voice
Cried after us aloud Hold in your feet
Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air
Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish
 Whereat my leader turning me bespake
Pause and then onward at their pace proceed
 I staid and saw two Spirits in whose look
Impatient eagerness of mind was markd
To overtake me but the load they bare
And narrow path retarded their approach
 Soon as arrivd they with an eye askance
Perusd me but spake not then turning each
To other thus conferring said This one
Seems by the action of his throat alive
And be they dead what privilege allows
They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole
 Then thus to me Tuscan who visitest
The college of the mourning hypocrites
Disdain not to instruct us who thou art
 By Arnos pleasant stream I thus replied
In the great city I was bred and grew
And wear the body I have ever worn
but who are ye from whom such mighty grief
As now I witness courseth down your cheeks
What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe
Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue
One of them answerd are so leaden gross
That with their weight they make the balances
To crack beneath them Joyous friars we were
Bolognas natives Catalano I
He Loderingo namd and by thy land
Together taken as men used to take
A single and indifferent arbiter
To reconcile their strifes How there we sped
Gardingos vicinage can best declare
 O friars I began your miseries
But there brake off for one had caught my eye
Fixd to a cross with three stakes on the ground
He when he saw me writhd himself throughout
Distorted ruffling with deep sighs his beard
And Catalano who thereof was ware
Thus spake That pierced spirit whom intent
Thou viewst was he who gave the Pharisees
Counsel that it were fitting for one man
To suffer for the people He doth lie
Transverse nor any passes but him first
Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs
In straits like this along the foss are placd
The father of his consort and the rest
Partakers in that council seed of ill
And sorrow to the Jews I noted then
How Virgil gazd with wonder upon him
Thus abjectly extended on the cross
In banishment eternal To the friar
He next his words addressd We pray ye tell
If so be lawful whether on our right
Lies any opening in the rock whereby
We both may issue hence without constraint
On the dark angels that compelld they come
To lead us from this depth He thus replied
Nearer than thou dost hope there is a rock
From the next circle moving which oersteps
Each vale of horror save that here his cope
Is shatterd By the ruin ye may mount
For on the side it slants and most the height
Rises below With head bent down awhile
My leader stood then spake He warnd us ill
Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook
 To whom the friar At Bologna erst
I many vices of the devil heard
Among the rest was said He is a liar
And the father of lies When he had spoke
My leader with large strides proceeded on
Somewhat disturbd with anger in his look
 I therefore left the spirits heavy laden
And following his beloved footsteps markd



CANTO XXIV

IN the years early nonage when the sun
Tempers his tresses in Aquarius urn
And now towards equal day the nights recede
When as the rime upon the earth puts on
Her dazzling sisters image but not long
Her milder sway endures then riseth up
The village hind whom fails his wintry store
And looking out beholds the plain around
All whitend whence impatiently he smites
His thighs and to his hut returning in
There paces to and fro wailing his lot
As a discomfited and helpless man
Then comes he forth again and feels new hope
Spring in his bosom finding een thus soon
The world hath changd its countnance grasps his crook
And forth to pasture drives his little flock
So me my guide disheartend when I saw
His troubled forehead and so speedily
That ill was curd for at the fallen bridge
Arriving towards me with a look as sweet
He turnd him back as that I first beheld
At the steep mountains foot Regarding well
The ruin and some counsel first maintaind
With his own thought he opend wide his arm
And took me up As one who while he works
Computes his labours issue that he seems
Still to foresee the effect so lifting me
Up to the summit of one peak he fixd
His eye upon another Grapple that
Said he but first make proof if it be such
As will sustain thee For one cappd with lead
This were no journey Scarcely he though light
And I though onward pushd from crag to crag
Could mount And if the precinct of this coast
Were not less ample than the last for him
I know not but my strength had surely faild
But Malebolge all toward the mouth
Inclining of the nethermost abyss
The site of every valley hence requires
That one side upward slope the other fall
 At length the point of our descent we reachd
From the last flag soon as to that arrivd
So was the breath exhausted from my lungs
I could no further but did seat me there
 Now needs thy best of man so spake my guide
For not on downy plumes nor under shade
Of canopy reposing fame is won
Without which whosoeer consumes his days
Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth
As smoke in air or foam upon the wave
Thou therefore rise vanish thy weariness
By the minds effort in each struggle formd
To vanquish if she suffer not the weight
Of her corporeal frame to crush her down
A longer ladder yet remains to scale
From these to have escapd sufficeth not
If well thou note me profit by my words
 I straightway rose and showd myself less spent
Than I in truth did feel me On I cried
For I am stout and fearless Up the rock
Our way we held more rugged than before
Narrower and steeper far to climb From talk
I ceasd not as we journeyd so to seem
Least faint whereat a voice from the other foss
Did issue forth for uttrance suited ill
Though on the arch that crosses there I stood
What were the words I knew not but who spake
Seemd movd in anger Down I stoopd to look
But my quick eye might reach not to the depth
For shrouding darkness wherefore thus I spake
To the next circle Teacher bend thy steps
And from the wall dismount we for as hence
I hear and understand not so I see
Beneath and naught discernI answer not
Said he but by the deed To fair request
Silent performance maketh best return
 We from the bridges head descended where
To the eighth mound it joins and then the chasm
Opening to view I saw a crowd within
Of serpents terrible so strange of shape
And hideous that remembrance in my veins
Yet shrinks the vital current Of her sands
Let Lybia vaunt no more if Jaculus
Pareas and Chelyder be her brood
Cenchris and Amphisboena plagues so dire
Or in such numbers swarming neer she shewd
Not with all Ethiopia and whateer
Above the Erythraean sea is spawnd
 Amid this dread exuberance of woe
Ran naked spirits wingd with horrid fear
Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide
Or heliotrope to charm them out of view
With serpents were their hands behind them bound
Which through their reins infixd the tail and head
Twisted in folds before And lo on one
Near to our side darted an adder up
And where the neck is on the shoulders tied
Transpiercd him Far more quickly than eer pen
Wrote O or I he kindled burnd and changd
To ashes all pourd out upon the earth
When there dissolvd he lay the dust again
Uprolld spontaneous and the selfsame form
Instant resumed So mighty sages tell
The Arabian Phoenix when five hundred years
Have well nigh circled dies and springs forthwith
Renascent Blade nor herb throughout his life
He tastes but tears of frankincense alone
And odorous amomum swaths of nard
And myrrh his funeral shroud As one that falls
He knows not how by force demoniac draggd
To earth or through obstruction fettering up
In chains invisible the powers of man
Who risen from his trance gazeth around
Bewilderd with the monstrous agony
He hath endurd and wildly staring sighs
So stood aghast the sinner when he rose
 Oh how severe Gods judgment that deals out
Such blows in stormy vengeance Who he was
My teacher next inquird and thus in few
He answerd Vanni Fucci am I calld
Not long since rained down from Tuscany
To this dire gullet Me the beastial life
And not the human pleasd mule that I was
Who in Pistoia found my worthy den
 I then to Virgil Bid him stir not hence
And ask what crime did thrust him hither once
A man I knew him choleric and bloody
 The sinner heard and feignd not but towards me
His mind directing and his face wherein
Was dismal shame depicturd thus he spake
It grieves me more to have been caught by thee
In this sad plight which thou beholdest than
When I was taken from the other life
I have no power permitted to deny
What thou inquirest I am doomd thus low
To dwell for that the sacristy by me
Was rifled of its goodly ornaments
And with the guilt another falsely charged
But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus
So as thou eer shalt scape this darksome realm
Open thine ears and hear what I forebode
Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines
Then Florence changeth citizens and laws
From Valdimagra drawn by wrathful Mars
A vapour rises wrapt in turbid mists
And sharp and eager driveth on the storm
With arrowy hurtling oer Picenos field
Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst and strike
Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground
This have I told that grief may rend thy heart



CANTO XXV

WHEN he had spoke the sinner raisd his hands
Pointed in mockery and cried Take them God
I level them at thee From that day forth
The serpents were my friends for round his neck
One of then rolling twisted as it said
Be silent tongue Another to his arms
Upgliding tied them riveting itself
So close it took from them the power to move
 Pistoia Ah Pistoia why dost doubt
To turn thee into ashes cumbring earth
No longer since in evil act so far
Thou hast outdone thy seed I did not mark
Through all the gloomy circles of the abyss
Spirit that swelld so proudly gainst his God
Not him who headlong fell from Thebes He fled
Nor utterd more and after him there came
A centaur full of fury shouting Where
Where is the caitiff On Maremmas marsh
Swarm not the serpent tribe as on his haunch
They swarmd to where the human face begins
Behind his head upon the shoulders lay
With open wings a dragon breathing fire
On whomsoeer he met To me my guide
Cacus is this who underneath the rock
Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood
He from his brethren parted here must tread
A different journey for his fraudful theft
Of the great herd that near him stalld whence found
His felon deeds their end beneath the mace
Of stout Alcides that perchance laid on
A hundred blows and not the tenth was felt
 While yet he spake the centaur sped away
And under us three spirits came of whom
Nor I nor he was ware till they exclaimd
Say who are ye We then brake off discourse
Intent on these alone I knew them not
But as it chanceth oft befell that one
Had need to name another Where said he
Doth Cianfa lurk I for a sign my guide
Should stand attentive placd against my lips
The finger lifted If O reader now
Thou be not apt to credit what I tell
No marvel for myself do scarce allow
The witness of mine eyes But as I looked
Toward them lo a serpent with six feet
Springs forth on one and fastens full upon him
His midmost graspd the belly a forefoot
Seizd on each arm while deep in either cheek
He fleshd his fangs the hinder on the thighs
Were spread twixt which the tail inserted curld
Upon the reins behind Ivy neer claspd
A dodderd oak as round the others limbs
The hideous monster intertwind his own
Then as they both had been of burning wax
Each melted into other mingling hues
That which was either now was seen no more
Thus up the shrinking paper ere it burns
A brown tint glides not turning yet to black
And the clean white expires The other two
Lookd on exclaiming Ah how dost thou change
Agnello See Thou art nor double now
Nor only one The two heads now became
One and two figures blended in one form
Appeard where both were lost Of the four lengths
Two arms were made the belly and the chest
The thighs and legs into such members changd
As never eye hath seen Of former shape
All trace was vanishd Two yet neither seemd
That image miscreate and so passd on
With tardy steps As underneath the scourge
Of the fierce dogstar that lays bare the fields
Shifting from brake to brake the lizard seems
A flash of lightning if he thwart the road
So toward th entrails of the other two
Approaching seemd an adder all on fire
As the dark peppergrain livid and swart
In that part whence our life is nourishd first
One he transpiercd then down before him fell
Stretchd out The pierced spirit lookd on him
But spake not yea stood motionless and yawnd
As if by sleep or fevrous fit assaild
He eyd the serpent and the serpent him
One from the wound the other from the mouth
Breathd a thick smoke whose vapry columns joind
 Lucan in mute attention now may hear
Nor thy disastrous fate Sabellus tell
Nor shine Nasidius Ovid now be mute
What if in warbling fiction he record
Cadmus and Arethusa to a snake
Him changd and her into a fountain clear
I envy not for never face to face
Two natures thus transmuted did he sing
Wherein both shapes were ready to assume
The others substance They in mutual guise
So answerd that the serpent split his train
Divided to a fork and the piercd spirit
Drew close his steps together legs and thighs
Compacted that no sign of juncture soon
Was visible the tail disparted took
The figure which the spirit lost its skin
Softning his indurated to a rind
The shoulders next I markd that entring joind
The monsters armpits whose two shorter feet
So lengthend as the others dwindling shrunk
The feet behind then twisting up became
That part that man conceals which in the wretch
Was cleft in twain While both the shadowy smoke
With a new colour veils and generates
Th excrescent pile on one peeling it off
From th other body lo upon his feet
One upright rose and prone the other fell
Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps
Were shifted though each feature changd beneath
Of him who stood erect the mounting face
Retreated towards the temples and what there
Superfluous matter came shot out in ears
From the smooth cheeks the rest not backward draggd
Of its excess did shape the nose and swelld
Into due size protuberant the lips
He on the earth who lay meanwhile extends
His sharpend visage and draws down the ears
Into the head as doth the slug his horns
His tongue continuous before and apt
For uttrance severs and the others fork
Closing unites That done the smoke was laid
The soul transformd into the brute glides off
Hissing along the vale and after him
The other talking sputters but soon turnd
His newgrown shoulders on him and in few
Thus to another spake Along this path
Crawling as I have done speed Buoso now
 So saw I fluctuate in successive change
Th unsteady ballast of the seventh hold
And here if aught my tongue have swervd events
So strange may be its warrant Oer mine eyes
Confusion hung and on my thoughts amaze
 Yet scapd they not so covertly but well
I markd Sciancato he alone it was
Of the three first that came who changd not thou
The others fate Gaville still dost rue



CANTO XXVI

FLORENCE exult for thou so mightily
Hast thriven that oer land and sea thy wings
Thou beatest and thy name spreads over hell
Among the plundrers such the three I found
Thy citizens whence shame to me thy son
And no proud honour to thyself redounds
 But if our minds when dreaming near the dawn
Are of the truth presageful thou ere long
Shalt feel what Prato not to say the rest
Would fain might come upon thee and that chance
Were in good time if it befell thee now
Would so it were since it must needs befall
For as time wears me I shall grieve the more
 We from the depth departed and my guide
Remounting scald the flinty steps which late
We downward tracd and drew me up the steep
Pursuing thus our solitary way
Among the crags and splinters of the rock
Sped not our feet without the help of hands
 Then sorrow seizd me which een now revives
As my thought turns again to what I saw
And more than I am wont I rein and curb
The powers of nature in me lest they run
Where Virtue guides not that if aught of good
My gentle star or something better gave me
I envy not myself the precious boon
 As in that season when the sun least veils
His face that lightens all what time the fly
Gives way to the shrill gnat the peasant then
Upon some cliff reclind beneath him sees
Fireflies innumerous spangling oer the vale
Vineyard or tilth where his daylabour lies
With flames so numberless throughout its space
Shone the eighth chasm apparent when the depth
Was to my view exposd As he whose wrongs
The bears avengd at its departure saw
Elijahs chariot when the steeds erect
Raisd their steep flight for heavn his eyes meanwhile
Straining pursud them till the flame alone
Upsoaring like a misty speck he kennd
Een thus along the gulf moves every flame
A sinner so enfolded close in each
That none exhibits token of the theft
 Upon the bridge I forward bent to look
And graspd a flinty mass or else had falln
Though pushd not from the height The guide who mark d
How I did gaze attentive thus began
Within these ardours are the spirits each
Swathd in confining fireMaster thy word
I answerd hath assurd me yet I deemd
Already of the truth already wishd
To ask thee who is in yon fire that comes
So parted at the summit as it seemd
Ascending from that funeral pile where lay
The Theban brothers He replied Within
Ulysses there and Diomede endure
Their penal tortures thus to vengeance now
Together hasting as erewhile to wrath
These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore
The ambush of the horse that opend wide
A portal for that goodly seed to pass
Which sowd imperial Rome nor less the guile
Lament they whence of her Achilles reft
Deidamia yet in death complains
And there is rued the stratagem that Troy
Of her Palladium spoildIf they have power
Of uttrance from within these sparks said I
O master think my prayer a thousand fold
In repetition urgd that thou vouchsafe
To pause till here the horned flame arrive
See how toward it with desire I bend
 He thus Thy prayer is worthy of much praise
And I accept it therefore but do thou
Thy tongue refrain to question them be mine
For I divine thy wish and they perchance
For they were Greeks might shun discourse with thee
 When there the flame had come where time and place
Seemd fitting to my guide he thus began
O ye who dwell two spirits in one fire
If living I of you did merit aught
Whateer the measure were of that desert
When in the world my lofty strain I pourd
Move ye not on till one of you unfold
In what clime death oertook him selfdestroyd
 Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn
Began to roll murmuring as a fire
That labours with the wind then to and fro
Wagging the top as a tongue uttering sounds
Threw out its voice and spake When I escapd
From Circe who beyond a circling year
Had held me near Caieta by her charms
Ere thus Aeneas yet had namd the shore
Nor fondness for my son nor reverence
Of my old father nor return of love
That should have crownd Penelope with joy
Could overcome in me the zeal I had
T explore the world and search the ways of life
Mans evil and his virtue Forth I saild
Into the deep illimitable main
With but one bark and the small faithful band
That yet cleavd to me As Iberia far
Far as Morocco either shore I saw
And the Sardinian and each isle beside
Which round that ocean bathes Tardy with age
Were I and my companions when we came
To the strait pass where Hercules ordaind
The boundries not to be oersteppd by man
The walls of Seville to my right I left
On the other hand already Ceuta past
O brothers I began who to the west
Through perils without number now have reachd
To this the short remaining watch that yet
Our senses have to wake refuse not proof
Of the unpeopled world following the track
Of Phoebus Call to mind from whence we sprang
Ye were not formd to live the life of brutes
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high
With these few words I sharpend for the voyage
The mind of my associates that I then
Could scarcely have withheld them To the dawn
Our poop we turnd and for the witless flight
Made our oars wings still gaining on the left
Each star of the other pole night now beheld
And ours so low that from the oceanfloor
It rose not Five times reillumd as oft
Vanishd the light from underneath the moon
Since the deep way we enterd when from far
Appeard a mountain dim loftiest methought
Of all I eer beheld Joy seizd us straight
But soon to mourning changed From the new land
A whirlwind sprung and at her foremost side
Did strike the vessel Thrice it whirld her round
With all the waves the fourth time lifted up
The poop and sank the prow so fate decreed
And over us the booming billow closd



CANTO XXVII

NOW upward rose the flame and stilld its light
To speak no more and now passd on with leave
From the mild poet gaind when following came
Another from whose top a sound confusd
Forth issuing drew our eyes that way to look
 As the Sicilian bull that rightfully
His cries first echoed who had shapd its mould
Did so rebellow with the voice of him
Tormented that the brazen monster seemd
Piercd through with pain thus while no way they found
Nor avenue immediate through the flame
Into its language turnd the dismal words
But soon as they had won their passage forth
Up from the point which vibrating obeyd
Their motion at the tongue these sounds we heard
O thou to whom I now direct my voice
That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase
 Depart thou I solicit thee no more
Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive
Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile
And with me parley lo it irks not me
And yet I burn If but een now thou fall
into this blind world from that pleasant land
Of Latium whence I draw my sum of guilt
Tell me if those who in Romagna dwell
Have peace or war For of the mountains there
Was I betwixt Urbino and the height
Whence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood
 Leaning I listend yet with heedful ear
When as he touchd my side the leader thus
Speak thou he is a Latian My reply
Was ready and I spake without delay
 O spirit who art hidden here below
Never was thy Romagna without war
In her proud tyrants bosoms nor is now
But open war there left I none The state
Ravenna hath maintaind this many a year
Is steadfast There Polentas eagle broods
And in his broad circumference of plume
Oershadows Cervia The green talons grasp
The land that stood erewhile the proof so long
And pild in bloody heap the host of France
 The old mastiff of Verruchio and the young
That tore Montagna in their wrath still make
Where they are wont an augre of their fangs
 Lamones city and Santernos range
Under the lion of the snowy lair
Inconstant partisan that changeth sides
Or ever summer yields to winters frost
And she whose flank is washd of Savios wave
As twixt the level and the steep she lies
Lives so twixt tyrant power and liberty
 Now tell us I entreat thee who art thou
Be not more hard than others In the world
So may thy name still rear its forehead high
 Then roard awhile the fire its sharpend point
On either side wavd and thus breathd at last
If I did think my answer were to one
Who ever could return unto the world
This flame should rest unshaken But since neer
If true be told me any from this depth
Has found his upward way I answer thee
Nor fear lest infamy record the words
 A man of arms at first I clothd me then
In good Saint Francis girdle hoping so
T have made amends And certainly my hope
Had faild not but that he whom curses light on
The high priest again seducd me into sin
And how and wherefore listen while I tell
Long as this spirit movd the bones and pulp
My mother gave me less my deeds bespake
The nature of the lion than the fox
All ways of winding subtlety I knew
And with such art conducted that the sound
Reachd the worlds limit Soon as to that part
Of life I found me come when each behoves
To lower sails and gather in the lines
That which before had pleased me then I rued
And to repentance and confession turnd
Wretch that I was and well it had bested me
The chief of the new Pharisees meantime
Waging his warfare near the Lateran
Not with the Saracens or Jews his foes
All Christians were nor against Acre one
Had fought nor trafficd in the Soldans land
He his great charge nor sacred ministry
In himself revrencd nor in me that cord
Which usd to mark with leanness whom it girded
As in Socrate Constantine besought
To cure his leprosy Sylvesters aid
So me to cure the fever of his pride
This man besought my counsel to that end
He askd and I was silent for his words
Seemd drunken but forthwith he thus resumd
From thy heart banish fear of all offence
I hitherto absolve thee In return
Teach me my purpose so to execute
That Penestrino cumber earth no more
Heavn as thou knowest I have power to shut
And open and the keys are therefore twain
The which my predecessor meanly prizd
 Then yielding to the forceful arguments
Of silence as more perilous I deemd
And answerd Father since thou washest me
Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall
Large promise with performance scant be sure
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat
 When I was numberd with the dead then came
Saint Francis for me but a cherub dark
He met who cried Wrong me not he is mine
And must below to join the wretched crew
For the deceitful counsel which he gave
Eer since I watchd him hovring at his hair
No power can the impenitent absolve
Nor to repent and will at once consist
By contradiction absolute forbid
Oh misry how I shook myself when he
Seizd me and cried Thou haply thoughtst me not
A disputant in logic so exact
To Minos down he bore me and the judge
Twind eight times round his callous back the tail
Which biting with excess of rage he spake
This is a guilty soul that in the fire
Must vanish Hence perditiondoomd I rove
A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb
 When he had thus fulfilld his words the flame
In dolour parted beating to and fro
And writhing its sharp horn We onward went
I and my leader up along the rock
Far as another arch that overhangs
The foss wherein the penalty is paid
Of those who load them with committed sin



CANTO XXVIII

WHO een in words unfetterd might at full
Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw
Though he repeated oft the tale No tongue
So vast a theme could equal speech and thought
Both impotent alike If in one band
Collected stood the people all who eer
Pourd on Apulias happy soil their blood
Slain by the Trojans and in that long war
When of the rings the measurd booty made
A pile so high as Romes historian writes
Who errs not with the multitude that felt
The grinding force of Guiscards Norman steel
And those the rest whose bones are gatherd yet
At Ceperano there where treachery
Branded th Apulian name or where beyond
Thy walls O Tagliacozzo without arms
The old Alardo conquerd and his limbs
One were to show transpiercd another his
Clean lopt away a spectacle like this
Were but a thing of nought to the hideous sight
Of the ninth chasm A rundlet that hath lost
Its middle or side stave gapes not so wide
As one I markd torn from the chin throughout
Down to the hinder passage twixt the legs
Dangling his entrails hung the midriff lay
Open to view and wretched ventricle
That turns th englutted aliment to dross
 Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze
He eyd me with his hands laid his breast bare
And cried Now mark how I do rip me lo
How is Mohammed mangled before me
Walks Ali weeping from the chin his face
Cleft to the forelock and the others all
Whom here thou seest while they livd did sow
Scandal and schism and therefore thus are rent
A fiend is here behind who with his sword
Hacks us thus cruelly slivering again
Each of this ream when we have compast round
The dismal way for first our gashes close
Ere we repass before him But say who
Art thou that standest musing on the rock
Haply so lingering to delay the pain
Sentencd upon thy crimesHim death not yet
My guide rejoind hath overtaen nor sin
Conducts to torment but that he may make
Full trial of your state I who am dead
Must through the depths of hell from orb to orb
Conduct him Trust my words for they are true
 More than a hundred spirits when that they heard
Stood in the foss to mark me through amazed
Forgetful of their pangs Thou who perchance
Shalt shortly view the sun this warning thou
Bear to Dolcino bid him if he wish not
Here soon to follow me that with good store
Of food he arm him lest imprisning snows
Yield him a victim to Novaras power
No easy conquest else With foot upraisd
For stepping spake Mohammed on the ground
Then fixd it to depart Another shade
Piercd in the throat his nostrils mutilate
Een from beneath the eyebrows and one ear
Lopt off who with the rest through wonder stood
Gazing before the rest advancd and bard
His windpipe that without was all oersmeard
With crimson stain O thou said he whom sin
Condemns not and whom erst unless too near
Resemblance do deceive me I aloft
Have seen on Latian ground call thou to mind
Piero of Medicina if again
Returning thou beholdst the pleasant land
That from Vercelli slopes to Mercabo
And there instruct the twain whom Fano boasts
Her worthiest sons Guido and Angelo
That if t is givn us here to scan aright
The future they out of lifes tenement
Shall be cast forth and whelmd under the waves
Near to Cattolica through perfidy
Of a fell tyrant Twixt the Cyprian isle
And Balearic neer hath Neptune seen
An injury so foul by pirates done
Or Argive crew of old That oneeyd traitor
Whose realm there is a spirit here were fain
His eye had still lackd sight of them shall bring
To confrence with him then so shape his end
That they shall need not gainst Focaras wind
Offer up vow nor prayr I answering thus
 Declare as thou dost wish that I above
May carry tidings of thee who is he
In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance
 Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheekbone
Of one his fellowspirit and his jaws
Expanding cried Lo this is he I wot of
He speaks not for himself the outcast this
Who overwhelmd the doubt in Caesars mind
Affirming that delay to men prepard
Was ever harmful Oh how terrified
Methought was Curio from whose throat was cut
The tongue which spake that hardy word Then one
Maimd of each hand uplifted in the gloom
The bleeding stumps that they with gory spots
Sullied his face and cried Remember thee
Of Mosca too I who alas exclaimd
The deed once done there is an end that provd
A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race
 I added Ay and death to thine own tribe
 Whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off
As one grief stung to madness But I there
Still lingerd to behold the troop and saw
Things such as I may fear without more proof
To tell of but that conscience makes me firm
The boon companion who her strong breastplate
Buckles on him that feels no guilt within
And bids him on and fear not Without doubt
I saw and yet it seems to pass before me
A headless trunk that even as the rest
Of the sad flock pacd onward By the hair
It bore the severd member lanternwise
Pendent in hand which lookd at us and said
Woes me The spirit lighted thus himself
And two there were in one and one in two
How that may be he knows who ordereth so
 When at the bridges foot direct he stood
His arm aloft he reard thrusting the head
Full in our view that nearer we might hear
The words which thus it utterd Now behold
This grievous torment thou who breathing gost
To spy the dead behold if any else
Be terrible as this And that on earth
Thou mayst bear tidings of me know that I
Am Bertrand he of Born who gave King John
The counsel mischievous Father and son
I set at mutual war For Absalom
And David more did not Ahitophel
Spurring them on maliciously to strife
For parting those so closely knit my brain
Parted alas I carry from its source
That in this trunk inhabits Thus the law
Of retribution fiercely works in me



CANTO XXIX

SO were mine eyes inebriate with view
Of the vast multitude whom various wounds
Disfigurd that they longd to stay and weep
 But Virgil rousd me What yet gazest on
Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below
Among the maimd and miserable shades
Thou hast not shewn in any chasm beside
This weakness Know if thou wouldst number them
That two and twenty miles the valley winds
Its circuit and already is the moon
Beneath our feet the time permitted now
Is short and more not seen remains to see
 If thou I straight replied hadst weighd the cause
For which I lookd thou hadst perchance excusd
The tarrying still My leader part pursud
His way the while I followd answering him
And adding thus Within that cave I deem
Whereon so fixedly I held my ken
There is a spirit dwells one of my blood
Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear
 Then spake my master Let thy soul no more
Afflict itself for him Direct elsewhere
Its thought and leave him At the bridges foot
I markd how he did point with menacing look
At thee and heard him by the others namd
Geri of Bello Thou so wholly then
Wert busied with his spirit who once ruld
The towers of Hautefort that thou lookedst not
That way ere he was goneO guide belovd
His violent death yet unavengd said I
By any who are partners in his shame
Made him contemptuous therefore as I think
He passd me speechless by and doing so
Hath made me more compassionate his fate
 So we discoursd to where the rock first showd
The other valley had more light been there
Een to the lowest depth Soon as we came
Oer the last cloister in the dismal rounds
Of Malebolge and the brotherhood
Were to our view exposd then many a dart
Of sore lament assaild me headed all
With points of thrilling pity that I closd
Both ears against the volley with mine hands
 As were the torment if each lazarhouse
Of Valdichiana in the sultry time
Twixt July and September with the isle
Sardinia and Maremmas pestilent fen
Had heapd their maladies all in one foss
Together such was here the torment dire
The stench as issuing steams from festerd limbs
 We on the utmost shore of the long rock
Descended still to leftward Then my sight
Was livelier to explore the depth wherein
The minister of the most mighty Lord
Allsearching Justice dooms to punishment
The forgers noted on her dread record
 More rueful was it not methinks to see
The nation in Aegina droop what time
Each living thing een to the little worm
All fell so full of malice was the air
And afterward as bards of yore have told
The ancient people were restord anew
From seed of emmets than was here to see
The spirits that languishd through the murky vale
Uppild on many a stack Confusd they lay
One oer the belly oer the shoulders one
Rolld of another sideling crawld a third
Along the dismal pathway Step by step
We journeyd on in silence looking round
And listning those diseasd who strove in vain
To lift their forms Then two I markd that sat
Proppd gainst each other as two brazen pans
Set to retain the heat From head to foot
A tetter barkd them round Nor saw I eer
Groom currying so fast for whom his lord
Impatient waited or himself perchance
Tird with long watching as of these each one
Plied quickly his keen nails through furiousness
Of neer abated pruriency The crust
Came drawn from underneath in flakes like scales
Scrapd from the bream or fish of broader mail
 O thou who with thy fingers rendest off
Thy coat of proof thus spake my guide to one
And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them
Tell me if any born of Latian land
Be among these within so may thy nails
Serve thee for everlasting to this toil
 Both are of Latium weeping he replied
Whom torturd thus thou seest but who art thou
That hast inquird of us To whom my guide
One that descend with this man who yet lives
From rock to rock and show him hells abyss
 Then started they asunder and each turnd
Trembling toward us with the rest whose ear
Those words redounding struck To me my liege
Addressd him Speak to them whateer thou list
 And I therewith began So may no time
Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men
In th upper world but after many suns
Survive it as ye tell me who ye are
And of what race ye come Your punishment
Unseemly and disgustful in its kind
Deter you not from opening thus much to me
 Arezzo was my dwelling answerd one
And me Albero of Sienna brought
To die by fire but that for which I died
Leads me not here True is in sport I told him
That I had learnd to wing my flight in air
And he admiring much as he was void
Of wisdom willd me to declare to him
The secret of mine art and only hence
Because I made him not a Daedalus
Prevaild on one supposd his sire to burn me
But Minos to this chasm last of the ten
For that I practisd alchemy on earth
Has doomd me Him no subterfuge eludes
 Then to the bard I spake Was ever race
Light as Siennas Sure not France herself
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain
 The other leprous spirit heard my words
And thus returnd Be Stricca from this charge
Exempted he who knew so temprately
To lay out fortunes gifts and Niccolo
Who first the spices costly luxury
Discoverd in that garden where such seed
Roots deepest in the soil and be that troop
Exempted with whom Caccia of Asciano
Lavishd his vineyards and widespreading woods
And his rare wisdom Abbagliato showd
A spectacle for all That thou mayst know
Who seconds thee against the Siennese
Thus gladly bend this way thy sharpend sight
That well my face may answer to thy ken
So shalt thou see I am Capocchios ghost
Who forgd transmuted metals by the power
Of alchemy and if I scan thee right
Thus needs must well remember how I aped
Creative nature by my subtle art



CANTO XXX

WHAT time resentment burnd in Junos breast
For Semele against the Theban blood
As more than once in dire mischance was rued
Such fatal frenzy seizd on Athamas
That he his spouse beholding with a babe
Laden on either arm Spread out he cried
The meshes that I take the lioness
And the young lions at the pass then forth
Stretchd he his merciless talons grasping one
One helpless innocent Learchus namd
Whom swinging down he dashd upon a rock
And with her other burden selfdestroyd
The hapless mother plungd and when the pride
Of allpresuming Troy fell from its height
By fortune overwhelmd and the old king
With his realm perishd then did Hecuba
A wretch forlorn and captive when she saw
Polyxena first slaughterd and her son
Her Polydorus on the wild seabeach
Next met the mourners view then reft of sense
Did she run barking even as a dog
Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul
Bet neer the Furies or of Thebes or Troy
With such fell cruelty were seen their goads
Infixing in the limbs of man or beast
As now two pale and naked ghost I saw
That gnarling wildly scamperd like the swine
Excluded from his stye One reachd Capocchio
And in the neckjoint sticking deep his fangs
Draggd him that oer the solid pavement rubbd
His belly stretchd out prone The other shape
He of Arezzo there left trembling spake
That sprite of air is Schicchi in like mood
Of random mischief vent he still his spite
 To whom I answring Oh as thou dost hope
The other may not flesh its jaws on thee
Be patient to inform us who it is
Ere it speed hence That is the ancient soul
Of wretched Myrrha he replied who burnd
With most unholy flame for her own sire
And a false shape assuming so performd
The deed of sin een as the other there
That onward passes dard to counterfeit
Donatis features to feignd testament
The seal affixing that himself might gain
For his own share the lady of the herd
 When vanishd the two furious shades on whom
Mine eye was held I turnd it back to view
The other cursed spirits One I saw
In fashion like a lute had but the groin
Been severd where it meets the forked part
Swoln dropsy disproportioning the limbs
With illconverted moisture that the paunch
Suits not the visage opend wide his lips
Gasping as in the hectic man for drought
One towards the chin the other upward curld
 O ye who in this world of misery
Wherefore I know not are exempt from pain
Thus he began attentively regard
Adamos woe When living full supply
Neer lackd me of what most I coveted
One drop of water now alas I crave
The rills that glitter down the grassy slopes
Of Casentino making fresh and soft
The banks whereby they glide to Arnos stream
Stand ever in my view and not in vain
For more the picturd semblance dries me up
Much more than the disease which makes the flesh
Desert these shriveld cheeks So from the place
Where I transgressd stern justice urging me
Takes means to quicken more my labring sighs
There is Romena where I falsified
The metal with the Baptists form imprest
For which on earth I left my body burnt
But if I here might see the sorrowing soul
Of Guido Alessandro or their brother
For Brandas limpid spring I would not change
The welcome sight One is een now within
If truly the mad spirits tell that round
Are wandring But wherein besteads me that
My limbs are fetterd Were I but so light
That I each hundred years might move one inch
I had set forth already on this path
Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew
Although eleven miles it wind not more
Than half of one across They brought me down
Among this tribe inducd by them I stampd
The florens with three carats of alloy
 Who are that abject pair I next inquird
That closely bounding thee upon thy right
Lie smoking like a band in winter steepd
In the chill streamWhen to this gulf I dropt
He answerd here I found them since that hour
They have not turnd nor ever shall I ween
Till time hath run his course One is that dame
The false accuser of the Hebrew youth
Sinon the other that false Greek from Troy
Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out
In such a cloud upsteamd When that he heard
One galld perchance to be so darkly namd
With clenchd hand smote him on the braced paunch
That like a drum resounded but forthwith
Adamo smote him on the face the blow
Returning with his arm that seemd as hard
 Though my oerweighty limbs have taen from me
The power to move said he I have an arm
At liberty for such employ To whom
Was answerd When thou wentest to the fire
Thou hadst it not so ready at command
Then readier when it coind th impostor gold
 And thus the dropsied Ay now speakst thou true
But there thou gavst not such true testimony
When thou wast questiond of the truth at Troy
 If I spake false thou falsely stampdst the coin
Said Sinon I am here but for one fault
And thou for more than any imp beside
 Remember he replied O perjurd one
The horse remember that did teem with death
And all the world be witness to thy guilt
 To thine returnd the Greek witness the thirst
Whence thy tongue cracks witness the fluid mound
Reard by thy belly up before thine eyes
A mass corrupt To whom the coiner thus
Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass
Its evil saying Me if thirst assails
Yet I am stuffd with moisture Thou art parchd
Pains rack thy head no urging wouldst thou need
To make thee lap Narcissus mirror up
 I was all fixd to listen when my guide
Admonishd Now beware a little more
And I do quarrel with thee I perceivd
How angrily he spake and towards him turnd
With shame so poignant as rememberd yet
Confounds me As a man that dreams of harm
Befalln him dreaming wishes it a dream
And that which is desires as if it were not
Such then was I who wanting power to speak
Wishd to excuse myself and all the while
Excusd me though unweeting that I did
 More grievous fault than thine has been less shame
My master cried might expiate Therefore cast
All sorrow from thy soul and if again
Chance bring thee where like conference is held
Think I am ever at thy side To hear
Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds



CANTO XXXI

THE very tongue whose keen reproof before
Had wounded me that either cheek was staind
Now ministerd my cure So have I heard
Achilles and his fathers javelin causd
Pain first and then the boon of health restord
 Turning our back upon the vale of woe
W crossd th encircled mound in silence There
Was twilight dim that far long the gloom
Mine eye advancd not but I heard a horn
Sounded aloud The peal it blew had made
The thunder feeble Following its course
The adverse way my strained eyes were bent
On that one spot So terrible a blast
Orlando blew not when that dismal rout
Oerthrew the host of Charlemagne and quenchd
His saintly warfare Thitherward not long
My head was raisd when many lofty towers
Methought I spied Master said I what land
Is this He answerd straight Too long a space
Of intervening darkness has thine eye
To traverse thou hast therefore widely errd
In thy imagining Thither arrivd
Thou well shalt see how distance can delude
The sense A little therefore urge thee on
 Then tenderly he caught me by the hand
Yet know said he ere farther we advance
That it less strange may seem these are not towers
But giants In the pit they stand immersd
Each from his navel downward round the bank
 As when a fog disperseth gradually
Our vision traces what the mist involves
Condensd in air so piercing through the gross
And gloomy atmosphere as more and more
We neard toward the brink mine error fled
And fear came oer me As with circling round
Of turrets Montereggion crowns his walls
Een thus the shore encompassing th abyss
Was turreted with giants half their length
Uprearing horrible whom Jove from heavn
Yet threatens when his muttring thunder rolls
 Of one already I descried the face
Shoulders and breast and of the belly huge
Great part and both arms down along his ribs
 Allteeming nature when her plastic hand
Left framing of these monsters did display
Past doubt her wisdom taking from mad War
Such slaves to do his bidding and if she
Repent her not of th elephant and whale
Who ponders well confesses her therein
Wiser and more discreet for when brute force
And evil will are backd with subtlety
Resistance none avails His visage seemd
In length and bulk as doth the pine that tops
Saint Peters Roman fane and th other bones
Of like proportion so that from above
The bank which girdled him below such height
Arose his stature that three Friezelanders
Had strivn in vain to reach but to his hair
Full thirty ample palms was he exposd
Downward from whence a man his garments loops
Raphel bai ameth sabi almi
So shouted his fierce lips which sweeter hymns
Became not and my guide addressd him thus
O senseless spirit let thy horn for thee
Interpret therewith vent thy rage if rage
Or other passion wring thee Search thy neck
There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on
Wild spirit lo upon thy mighty breast
Where hangs the baldrick Then to me he spake
He doth accuse himself Nimrod is this
Through whose ill counsel in the world no more
One tongue prevails But pass we on nor waste
Our words for so each language is to him
As his to others understood by none
 Then to the leftward turning sped we forth
And at a slings throw found another shade
Far fiercer and more huge I cannot say
What master hand had girt him but he held
Behind the right arm fetterd and before
The other with a chain that fastend him
From the neck down and five times round his form
Apparent met the wreathed links This proud one
Would of his strength against almighty Jove
Make trial said my guide whence he is thus
Requited Ephialtes him they call
Great was his prowess when the giants brought
Fear on the gods those arms which then he piled
Now moves he never Forthwith I returnd
Fain would I if t were possible mine eyes
Of Briareus immeasurable gaind
Experience next He answerd Thou shalt see
Not far from hence Antaeus who both speaks
And is unfetterd who shall place us there
Where guilt is at its depth Far onward stands
Whom thou wouldst fain behold in chains and made
Like to this spirit save that in his looks
More fell he seems By violent earthquake rockd
Neer shook a towr so reeling to its base
As Ephialtes More than ever then
I dreaded death nor than the terror more
Had needed if I had not seen the cords
That held him fast We straightway journeying on
Came to Antaeus who five ells complete
Without the head forth issued from the cave
 O thou who in the fortunate vale that made
Great Scipio heir of glory when his sword
Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight
Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil
An hundred lions and if thou hadst fought
In the high conflict on thy brethrens side
Seems as men yet believd that through thine arm
The sons of earth had conquerd now vouchsafe
To place us down beneath where numbing cold
Locks up Cocytus Force not that we crave
Or Tityus help or Typhons Here is one
Can give what in this realm ye covet Stoop
Therefore nor scornfully distort thy lip
He in the upper world can yet bestow
Renown on thee for he doth live and looks
For life yet longer if before the time
Grace call him not unto herself Thus spake
The teacher He in haste forth stretchd his hands
And caught my guide Alcides whilom felt
That grapple straightend score Soon as my guide
Had felt it he bespake me thus This way
That I may clasp thee then so caught me up
That we were both one burden As appears
The tower of Carisenda from beneath
Where it doth lean if chance a passing cloud
So sail across that opposite it hangs
Such then Antaeus seemd as at mine ease
I markd him stooping I were fain at times
T have passd another way Yet in th abyss
That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs
Iightly he placd us nor there leaning stayd
But rose as in a bark the stately mast



CANTO XXXII

COULD I command rough rhimes and hoarse to suit
That hole of sorrow oer which evry rock
His firm abutment rears then might the vein
Of fancy rise full springing but not mine
Such measures and with faltring awe I touch
The mighty theme for to describe the depth
Of all the universe is no emprize
To jest with and demands a tongue not usd
To infant babbling But let them assist
My song the tuneful maidens by whose aid
Amphion walld in Thebes so with the truth
My speech shall best accord Oh illstarrd folk
Beyond all others wretched who abide
In such a mansion as scarce thought finds words
To speak of better had ye here on earth
Been flocks or mountain goats As down we stood
In the dark pit beneath the giants feet
But lower far than they and I did gaze
Still on the lofty battlement a voice
Bespoke me thus Look how thou walkest Take
Good heed thy soles do tread not on the heads
Of thy poor brethren Thereupon I turnd
And saw before and underneath my feet
A lake whose frozen surface liker seemd
To glass than water Not so thick a veil
In winter eer hath Austrian Danube spread
Oer his still course nor Tanais far remote
Under the chilling sky Rolld oer that mass
Had Tabernich or Pietrapana falln
Not een its rim had creakd As peeps the frog
Croaking above the wave what time in dreams
The village gleaner oft pursues her toil
So to where modest shame appears thus low
Blue pinchd and shrind in ice the spirits stood
Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork
His face each downward held their mouth the cold
Their eyes expressd the dolour of their heart
 A space I lookd around then at my feet
Saw two so strictly joind that of their head
The very hairs were mingled Tell me ye
Whose bosoms thus together press said I
Who are ye At that sound their necks they bent
And when their looks were lifted up to me
Straightway their eyes before all moist within
Distilld upon their lips and the frost bound
The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there
Plank unto plank hath never cramp closd up
So stoutly Whence like two enraged goats
They clashd together them such fury seizd
 And one from whom the cold both ears had reft
Exclaimd still looking downward Why on us
Dost speculate so long If thou wouldst know
Who are these two the valley whence his wave
Bisenzio slopes did for its master own
Their sire Alberto and next him themselves
They from one body issued and throughout
Caina thou mayst search nor find a shade
More worthy in congealment to be fixd
Not him whose breast and shadow Arthurs land
At that one blow disseverd not Focaccia
No not this spirit whose oerjutting head
Obstructs my onward view he bore the name
Of Mascheroni Tuscan if thou be
Well knowest who he was and to cut short
All further question in my form behold
What once was Camiccione I await
Carlino here my kinsman whose deep guilt
Shall wash out mine A thousand visages
Then markd I which the keen and eager cold
Had shapd into a doggish grin whence creeps
A shivring horror oer me at the thought
Of those frore shallows While we journeyd on
Toward the middle at whose point unites
All heavy substance and I trembling went
Through that eternal chillness I know not
If will it were or destiny or chance
But passing midst the heads my foot did strike
With violent blow against the face of one
 Wherefore dost bruise me weeping he exclaimd
Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge
For Montaperto wherefore troublest me
 I thus Instructor now await me here
That I through him may rid me of my doubt
Thenceforth what haste thou wilt The teacher pausd
And to that shade I spake who bitterly
Still cursd me in his wrath What art thou speak
That railest thus on others He replied
Now who art thou that smiting others cheeks
Through Antenora roamest with such force
As were past suffrance wert thou living still
 And I am living to thy joy perchance
Was my reply if fame be dear to thee
That with the rest I may thy name enrol
 The contrary of what I covet most
Said he thou tenderst hence nor vex me more
Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale
 Then seizing on his hinder scalp I cried
Name thee or not a hair shall tarry here
 Rend all away he answerd yet for that
I will not tell nor show thee who I am
Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times
 Now I had graspd his tresses and stript off
More than one tuft he barking with his eyes
Drawn in and downward when another cried
What ails thee Bocca Sound not loud enough
Thy chattring teeth but thou must bark outright
What devil wrings thee Now said I be dumb
Accursed traitor to thy shame of thee
True tidings will I bear Off he replied
Tell what thou list but as thou escape from hence
To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib
Forget not here he wails the Frenchmans gold
Him of Duera thou canst say I markd
Where the starvd sinners pine If thou be askd
What other shade was with them at thy side
Is Beccaria whose red gorge distaind
The biting axe of Florence Farther on
If I misdeem not Soldanieri bides
With Ganellon and Tribaldello him
Who opd Faenza when the people slept
 We now had left him passing on our way
When I beheld two spirits by the ice
Pent in one hollow that the head of one
Was cowl unto the other and as bread
Is ravend up through hunger th uppermost
Did so apply his fangs to th others brain
Where the spine joins it Not more furiously
On Menalippus temples Tydeus gnawd
Than on that skull and on its garbage he
 O thou who showst so beastly sign of hate
Gainst him thou preyst on let me hear said I
The cause on such condition that if right
Warrant thy grievance knowing who ye are
And what the colour of his sinning was
I may repay thee in the world above
If that wherewith I speak be moist so long



CANTO XXXIII

HIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast
That sinner wipd them on the hairs o th head
Which he behind had mangled then began
Thy will obeying I call up afresh
Sorrow past cure which but to think of wrings
My heart or ere I tell ont But if words
That I may utter shall prove seed to bear
Fruit of eternal infamy to him
The traitor whom I gnaw at thou at once
Shalt see me speak and weep Who thou mayst be
I know not nor how here below art come
But Florentine thou seemest of a truth
When I do hear thee Know I was on earth
Count Ugolino and th Archbishop he
Ruggieri Why I neighbour him so close
Now list That through effect of his ill thoughts
In him my trust reposing I was taen
And after murderd need is not I tell
What therefore thou canst not have heard that is
How cruel was the murder shalt thou hear
And know if he have wrongd me A small grate
Within that mew which for my sake the name
Of famine bears where others yet must pine
Already through its opening sevral moons
Had shown me when I slept the evil sleep
That from the future tore the curtain off
This one methought as master of the sport
Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
Unto the mountain which forbids the sight
Of Lucca to the Pisan With lean brachs
Inquisitive and keen before him rangd
Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi
After short course the father and the sons
Seemd tird and lagging and methought I saw
The sharp tusks gore their sides When I awoke
Before the dawn amid their sleep I heard
My sons for they were with me weep and ask
For bread Right cruel art thou if no pang
Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold
And if not now why use thy tears to flow
Now had they wakend and the hour drew near
When they were wont to bring us food the mind
Of each misgave him through his dream and I
Heard at its outlet underneath lockd up
The horrible tower whence uttering not a word
I lookd upon the visage of my sons
I wept not so all stone I felt within
They wept and one my little Anslem cried
Thou lookest so Father what ails thee Yet
I shed no tear nor answerd all that day
Nor the next night until another sun
Came out upon the world When a faint beam
Had to our doleful prison made its way
And in four countenances I descryd
The image of my own on either hand
Through agony I bit and they who thought
I did it through desire of feeding rose
O th sudden and cried Father we should grieve
Far less if thou wouldst eat of us thou gavst
These weeds of miserable flesh we wear
And do thou strip them off from us again
Then not to make them sadder I kept down
My spirit in stillness That day and the next
We all were silent Ah obdurate earth
Why opendst not upon us When we came
To the fourth day then Geddo at my feet
Outstretchd did fling him crying Hast no help
For me my father There he died and een
Plainly as thou seest me saw I the three
Fall one by one twixt the fifth day and sixth
Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope
Over them all and for three days aloud
Calld on them who were dead Then fasting got
The mastery of grief Thus having spoke
Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
He fastend like a mastiffs gainst the bone
Firm and unyielding Oh thou Pisa shame
Of all the people who their dwelling make
In that fair region where th Italian voice
Is heard since that thy neighbours are so slack
To punish from their deep foundations rise
Capraia and Gorgona and dam up
The mouth of Arno that each soul in thee
May perish in the waters What if fame
Reported that thy castles were betrayd
By Ugolino yet no right hadst thou
To stretch his children on the rack For them
Brigata Ugaccione and the pair
Of gentle ones of whom my song hath told
Their tender years thou modern Thebes did make
Uncapable of guilt Onward we passd
Where others skarfd in rugged folds of ice
Not on their feet were turnd but each reversd
 There very weeping suffers not to weep
For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
Impediment and rolling inward turns
For increase of sharp anguish the first tears
Hang clusterd and like crystal vizors show
Under the socket brimming all the cup
 Now though the cold had from my face dislodgd
Each feeling as t were callous yet me seemd
Some breath of wind I felt Whence cometh this
Said I my master Is not here below
All vapour quenchdThou shalt be speedily
He answerd where thine eye shall tell thee whence
The cause descrying of this airy shower
 Then cried out one in the chill crust who mournd
O souls so cruel that the farthest post
Hath been assignd you from this face remove
The hardend veil that I may vent the grief
Impregnate at my heart some little space
Ere it congeal again I thus replied
Say who thou wast if thou wouldst have mine aid
And if I extricate thee not far down
As to the lowest ice may I descend
 The friar Alberigo answered he
Am I who from the evil garden pluckd
Its fruitage and am here repaid the date
More luscious for my figHah I exclaimd
Art thou too deadHow in the world aloft
It fareth with my body answerd he
I am right ignorant Such privilege
Hath Ptolomea that ofttimes the soul
Drops hither ere by Atropos divorcd
And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
The glazed teardrops that oerlay mine eyes
Know that the soul that moment she betrays
As I did yields her body to a fiend
Who after moves and governs it at will
Till all its time be rounded headlong she
Falls to this cistern And perchance above
Doth yet appear the body of a ghost
Who here behind me winters Him thou knowst
If thou but newly art arrivd below
The years are many that have passd away
Since to this fastness Branca Doria came
 Now answerd I methinks thou mockest me
For Branca Doria never yet hath died
But doth all natural functions of a man
Eats drinks and sleeps and putteth raiment on
 He thus Not yet unto that upper foss
By th evil talons guarded where the pitch
Tenacious boils had Michael Zanche reachd
When this one left a demon in his stead
In his own body and of one his kin
Who with him treachery wrought But now put forth
Thy hand and ope mine eyes I opd them not
Ill manners were best courtesy to him
 Ah Genoese men perverse in every way
With every foulness staind why from the earth
Are ye not canceld Such an one of yours
I with Romagnas darkest spirit found
As for his doings even now in soul
Is in Cocytus plungd and yet doth seem
In body still alive upon the earth



CANTO XXXIV

THE banners of Hells Monarch do come forth
Towards us therefore look so spake my guide
If thou discern him As when breathes a cloud
Heavy and dense or when the shades of night
Fall on our hemisphere seems viewd from far
A windmill which the blast stirs briskly round
Such was the fabric then methought I saw
 To shield me from the wind forthwith I drew
Behind my guide no covert else was there
 Now came I and with fear I bid my strain
Record the marvel where the souls were all
Whelmd underneath transparent as through glass
Pellucid the frail stem Some prone were laid
Others stood upright this upon the soles
That on his head a third with face to feet
Archd like a bow When to the point we came
Whereat my guide was pleasd that I should see
The creature eminent in beauty once
He from before me steppd and made me pause
 Lo he exclaimd lo Dis and lo the place
Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength
 How frozen and how faint I then became
Ask me not reader for I write it not
Since words would fail to tell thee of my state
I was not dead nor living Think thyself
If quick conception work in thee at all
How I did feel That emperor who sways
The realm of sorrow at mid breast from th ice
Stood forth and I in stature am more like
A giant than the giants are in his arms
Mark now how great that whole must be which suits
With such a part If he were beautiful
As he is hideous now and yet did dare
To scowl upon his Maker well from him
May all our misry flow Oh what a sight
How passing strange it seemd when I did spy
Upon his head three faces one in front
Of hue vermilion th other two with this
Midway each shoulder joind and at the crest
The right twixt wan and yellow seemd the left
To look on such as come from whence old Nile
Stoops to the lowlands Under each shot forth
Two mighty wings enormous as became
A bird so vast Sails never such I saw
Outstretchd on the wide sea No plumes had they
But were in texture like a bat and these
He flappd i th air that from him issued still
Three winds wherewith Cocytus to its depth
Was frozen At six eyes he wept the tears
Adown three chins distilld with bloody foam
At every mouth his teeth a sinner champd
Bruisd as with pondrous engine so that three
Were in this guise tormented But far more
Than from that gnawing was the foremost pangd
By the fierce rending whence ofttimes the back
Was stript of all its skin That upper spirit
Who hath worse punishment so spake my guide
Is Judas he that hath his head within
And plies the feet without Of th other two
Whose heads are under from the murky jaw
Who hangs is Brutus lo how he doth writhe
And speaks not Th other Cassius that appears
So large of limb But night now reascends
And it is time for parting All is seen
 I clippd him round the neck for so he bade
And noting time and place he when the wings
Enough were opd caught fast the shaggy sides
And down from pile to pile descending steppd
Between the thick fell and the jagged ice
 Soon as he reachd the point whereat the thigh
Upon the swelling of the haunches turns
My leader there with pain and struggling hard
Turnd round his head where his feet stood before
And grappled at the fell as one who mounts
That into hell methought we turnd again
 Expect that by such stairs as these thus spake
The teacher panting like a man forespent
We must depart from evil so extreme
Then at a rocky opening issued forth
And placd me on a brink to sit next joind
With wary step my side I raisd mine eyes
Believing that I Lucifer should see
Where he was lately left but saw him now
With legs held upward Let the grosser sort
Who see not what the point was I had passd
Bethink them if sore toil oppressd me then
 Arise my master cried upon thy feet
The way is long and much uncouth the road
And now within one hour and half of noon
The sun returns It was no palacehall
Lofty and luminous wherein we stood
But natural dungeon where ill footing was
And scant supply of light Ere from th abyss
I seprate thus when risen I began
My guide vouchsafe few words to set me free
From errors thralldom Where is now the ice
How standeth he in posture thus reversd
And how from eve to morn in space so brief
Hath the sun made his transit He in few
Thus answering spake Thou deemest thou art still
On th other side the centre where I graspd
Th abhorred worm that boreth through the world
Thou wast on th other side so long as I
Descended when I turnd thou didst oerpass
That point to which from evry part is draggd
All heavy substance Thou art now arrivd
Under the hemisphere opposed to that
Which the great continent doth overspread
And underneath whose canopy expird
The Man that was born sinless and so livd
Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere
Whose other aspect is Judecca Morn
Here rises when there evening sets and he
Whose shaggy pile was scald yet standeth fixd
As at the first On this part he fell down
From heavn and th earth here prominent before
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea
And to our hemisphere retird Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears
That sprang aloof There is a place beneath
From Belzebub as distant as extends
The vaulted tomb discoverd not by sight
But by the sound of brooklet that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock
Which as it winds with no precipitous course
The wave hath eaten By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter to return
To the fair world and heedless of repose
We climbed he first I following his steps
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heavn
Dawn through a circular opening in the cave
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars

Averroes called by the Arabians Roschd translated and commented
the works of Aristotle According to Tiraboschi storia della
Lett Ital t v 1 ii c ii sect 4 he was the source of
modern philosophical impiety The critic quotes some passages
from Petrarch Senil 1 v ep iii et Oper v ii p 1143 to
show how strongly such sentiments prevailed in the time of that
poet by whom they were held in horror and detestation He adds
that this fanatic admirer of Aristotle translated his writings
with that felicity which might be expected from one who did not
know a syllable of Greek and who was therefore compelled to
avail himself of the unfaithful Arabic versions DHerbelot on
the other hand informs us that Averroes was the first who
translated Aristotle from Greek into Arabic before the Jews had
made their translation and that we had for a long time no other
text of Aristotle except that of the Latin translation which
was made from this Arabic version of this great philosopher
Averroes who afterwards added to it a very ample commentary
of which Thomas Aquinas and the other scholastic writers
availed themselves before the Greek originals of Aristotle and
his commentators were known to us in Europe According to
DHerbelot he died in 1198 but Tiraboschi places that event
about 1206

CANTO VII

v 1 Ah me O Satan Satan Pape Satan Pape Satan aleppe
Pape is said by the commentators to be the same as the Latin word
papae strange Of aleppe they do not give a more
satisfactory account
See the Life of Benvenuto Cellini translated by Dr Nugent v
ii b iii c vii p 113 where he mentions having heard the
words Paix paix Satan allez paix in the court of justice
at Paris I recollected what Dante said when he with his master
Virgil entered the gates of hell for Dante and Giotto the
painter were together in France and visited Paris with
particular attention where the court of justice may be
considered as hell Hence it is that Dante who was likewise
perfect master of the French made use of that expression and I
have often been surprised that it was never understood in that
sense

which Dante had been delivered by Virgil Reckoning the beasts

others we shall have the number and if this be not
satisfactory we may suppose a determinate to have been put for
an indeterminate number

an angel has just passed by whose aid we shall overcome this

whom I call the first of my friends says Dante in his Vita

From the character given of him by contemporary writers his
temper was well formed to assimilate with that of our poet He
was according to G Villani l viii c 41 of a
philosophical and elegant mind if he had not been too delicate
and fastidious And Dino Compagni terms him a young and noble
knight brave and courteous but of a lofty scornful spirit much
addicted to solitude and study Muratori Rer Ital Script t 9

Guido Cavalcanti being more given to philosophy than poetry was
perhaps no great admirer of Virgil Some poetical compositions by
Guido are however still extant and his reputation for skill in
the art was such as to eclipse that of his predecessor and
namesake Guido Guinicelli as we shall see in the Purgatory

Guelfi were conquered by the army of King Manfredi near the
river Arbia with so great a slaughter that those who escaped
from that defeat took refuge not in Florence which city they
considered as lost to them but in Lucca Macchiavelli Hist

v 86 Such orisons This appears to allude to certain prayers
which were offered up in the churches of Florence for
deliverance from the hostile attempts of the Uberti

v 90 Singly there I stood Guido Novello assembled a council
of the Ghibellini at Empoli where it was agreed by all that in
order to maintain the ascendancy of the Ghibelline party in
Tuscany it was necessary to destroy Florence which could serve
only the people of that city beingvGuelfi to enable the party
attached to the church to recover its strength This cruel
sentence passed upon so noble a city met with no opposition
from any of its citizens or friends except Farinata degli
Uberti who openly and without reserve forbade the measure
affirming that he had endured so many hardships and encountered
so many dangers with no other view than that of being able to
pass his days in his own country Macchiavelli Hist of Flor b

species of philosophical course of lectures divided into theory
and practice or as he expresses it un enchaussement des
choses divines et humaines c Sir R Claytons Translation of
Tenhoves Memoirs of the Medici vol i ch ii p 104 The
Tresor has never been printed in the original language There is
a fine manuscript of it in the British Museum with an
illuminated portrait of Brunetto in his study prefixed Mus
Brit MSS 17 E 1 Tesor It is divided into four books the
first on Cosmogony and Theology the second a translation of
Aristotles Ethics the third on Virtues and Vices the fourth
on Rhetoric For an interesting memoir relating to this work
see Hist de lAcad des Inscriptions tom vii 296 His
Tesoretto one of the earliest productions of Italian poetry is
a curious work not unlike the writings of Chaucer in style and
numbers though Bembo remarks that his pupil however largely he
had stolen from it could not have much enriched himself As it
is perhaps but little known I will here add a slight sketch of
it

Brunetto describes himself as returning from an embassy to the
King of Spain on which he had been sent by the Guelph party from
Florence On the plain of Roncesvalles he meets a scholar on a
bay mule who tells him that the Guelfi are driven out of the
city with great loss

Struck with grief at these mournful tidings and musing with his
head bent downwards he loses his road and wanders into a wood
Here Nature whose figure is described with sublimity appears
and discloses to him the secrets of her operations After this
he wanders into a desert but at length proceeds on his way
under the protection of a banner with which Nature had furnished
him till on the third day he finds himself in a large pleasant
champaign where are assembled many emperors kings and sages
It is the habitation of Virtue and her daughters the four
Cardinal Virtues Here Brunetto sees also Courtesy Bounty
Loyalty and Prowess and hears the instructions they give to a
knight which occupy about a fourth part of the poem Leaving
this territory he passes over valleys mountains woods
forests and bridges till he arrives in a beautiful valley
covered with flowers on all sides and the richest in the world
but which was continually shifting its appearance from a round
figure to a square from obscurity to light and from
populousness to solitude This is the region of Pleasure or
Cupid who is accompanied by four ladies Love Hope Fear and
Desire In one part of it he meets with Ovid and is instructed
by him how to conquer the passion of love and to escape from
that place After his escape he makes his confession to a friar
and then returns to the forest of visions and ascending a
mountain he meets with Ptolemy a venerable old man Here the
narrative breaks off The poem ends as it began with an
address to Rustico di Filippo on whom he lavishes every sort of
praise

It has been observed that Dante derived the idea of opening his
poem by describing himself as lost in a wood from the Tesoretto
of his master I know not whether it has been remarked that the
crime of usury is branded by both these poets as offensive to God
and Nature or that the sin for which Brunetto is condemned by
his pupil is mentioned in the Tesoretto with great horror
Dantes twentyfifth sonnet is a jocose one addressed to
Brunetto He died in 1295

v 62 Who in old times came down from Fesole See G Villani
Hist l iv c 5 and Macchiavelli Hist of Flor b ii

v 89 With another text He refers to the prediction of
Farinata in Canto X

v 110 Priscian There is no reason to believe as the
commentators observe that the grammarian of this name was stained
with the vice imputed to him and we must therefore suppose that
Dante puts the individual for the species and implies the
frequency of the crime among those who abused the opportunities
which the education of youth afforded them to so abominable a
purpose

CANTO XVI

v 38 Gualdrada Gualdrada was the daughter of Bellincione
Berti of whom mention is made in the Paradise Canto XV and
XVI He was of the family of Ravignani a branch of the Adimari

The Emperor Otho IV being at a festival in Florence where
Gualdrada was present was struck with her beauty and inquiring
who she was was answered by Bellincione that she was the
daughter of one who if it was his Majestys pleasure would make
her admit the honour of his salute On overhearing this she
arose from her seat and blushing in an animated tone of voice
desired her father that he would not be so liberal in his offers
for that no man should ever be allowed that freedom except him
who should be her lawful husband The Emperor was not less
delighted by her resolute modesty than he had before been by the
loveliness of her person and calling to him Guido one of his
barons gave her to him in marriage at the same time raising him

to the rank of a count and bestowing on her the whole of
Casentino and a part of the territory of Romagna as her
portion Two sons were the offspring of this union Guglielmo
and Ruggieri the latter of whom was father of Guidoguerra a man
of great military skill and prowess who at the head of four
hundred Florentines of the Guelph party was signally
instrumental to the victory obtained at Benevento by Charles of
Anjou over Manfredi King of Naples in 1265 One of the
consequences of this victory was the expulsion of the Ghibellini

v 51 The good king Thibault Thibault I king of Navarre
died on the 8th of June 1233 as much to be commended for the
desire he showed of aiding the war in the Holy Land as
reprehensible and faulty for his design of oppressing the rights
and privileges of the church on which account it is said that
the whole kingdom was under an interdict for the space of three
entire years Thibault undoubtedly merits praise as for his
other endowments so especially for his cultivation of the
liberal arts his exercise and knowledge of music and poetry in
which he much excelled that he was accustomed to compose verses
and sing them to the viol and to exhibit his poetical
compositions publicly in his palace that they might be
criticized by all Mariana History of Spain b xiii c 9

An account of Thibault and two of his songs with what were
probably the original melodies may be seen in Dr Burneys
History of Music v ii c iv His poems which are in the
French language were edited by M lEveque de la Ravalliere

v 104 Joyous friars Those who ruled the city of Florence
on the part of the Ghibillines perceiving this discontent and
murmuring which they were fearful might produce a rebellion
against themselves in order to satisfy the people made choice
of two knights Frati Godenti joyous friars of Bologna on whom
they conferred the chief power in Florence One named M
Catalano de Malavolti the other M Loderingo di Liandolo one
an adherent of the Guelph the other of the Ghibelline party It
is to be remarked that the Joyous Friars were called Knights of
St Mary and became knights on taking that habit their robes
were white the mantle sable and the arms a white field and red
cross with two stars Their office was to defend widows and
orphans they were to act as mediators they had internal
regulations like other religious bodies The abovementioned M
Loderingo was the founder of that order But it was not long
before they too well deserved the appellation given them and
were found to be more bent on enjoying themselves than on any
other subject These two friars were called in by the
Florentines and had a residence assigned them in the palace
belonging to the people over against the Abbey Such was the
dependence placed on the character of their order that it was
expected they would be impartial and would save the commonwealth
any unnecessary expense instead of which though inclined to
opposite parties they secretly and hypocritically concurred in
promoting their own advantage rather than the public good G

prophetical threat to allude to the victory obtained by the
Marquis Marcello Malaspina of Valdimagra a tract of country now
called the Lunigiana who put himself at the head of the Neri and
defeated their opponents the Bianchi in the Campo Piceno near
Pistoia soon after the occurrence related in the preceding note

Of this engagement I find no mention in Villani Currado
Malaspina is introduced in the eighth Canto of Purgatory where
it appears that although on the present occaision they espoused
contrary sides some important favours were nevertheless
conferred by that family on our poet at a subsequent perid of his
exile in 1307

wwhich Tiraboschi expressed respecting the duration of Guidos

heretical doctrines He blamed the pope cardinals and other
prelates of the holy church for not observing their duty nor
leading the angelic life and affirmed that he ought to be pope
He was followed by more than three thousand men and women who
lived promiscuously on the mountains together like beasts and
when they wanted provisions supplied themselves by depredation
and rapine This lasted for two years till many being struck
with compunction at the dissolute life they led his sect was
much diminished and through failure of food and the severity of
the snows he was taken by the people of Novarra and burnt with
Margarita his companion and many other men and women whom his
errors had seduced G Villanni l viii c 84

CANTO XXXIII

v 14 Count Ugolino In the year 1288 in the month of July
Pisa was much divided by competitors for the sovereignty one
party composed of certain of the Guelphi being headed by the
Judge Nino di Gallura deVisconti another consisting of others
of the same faction by the Count Ugolino de Gherardeschi and
the third by the Archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini with the
Lanfranchi Sismondi Gualandi and other Ghibelline houses The
Count Ugolinoto effect his purpose united with the Archbishop
and his party and having betrayed Nino his sisters son they
contrived that he and his followers should either be driven out
of Pisa or their persons seized Nino hearing this and not
seeing any means of defending himself retired to Calci his
castle and formed an alliance with the Florentines and people of
Lucca against the Pisans The Count before Nino was gone in
order to cover his treachery when everything was settled for his
expulsion quitted Pisa and repaired to a manor of his called
Settimo whence as soon as he was informed of Ninos departure
he returned to Pisa with great rejoicing and festivity and was
elevated to the supreme power with every demonstration of triumph
and honour But his greatness was not of long continuauce It
pleased the Almighty that a total reverse of fortune should
ensue as a punishment for his acts of treachery and guilt for
he was said to have poisoned the Count Anselmo da Capraia his
sisters son on account of the envy and fear excited in his mind
by the high esteem in which the gracious manners of Anselmo were
held by the Pisans The power of the Guelphi being so much
diminished the Archbishop devised means to betray the Count
Uglino and caused him to be suddenly attacked in his palace by
the fury of the people whom he had exasperated by telling them
that Ugolino had betrayed Pisa and given up their castles to the
citizens of Florence and of Lucca He was immediately compelled
to surrender his bastard son and his grandson fell in the
assault and two of his sons with their two sons also were
conveyed to prison G Villani l vii c 120

In the following march the Pisans who had imprisoned the Count
Uglino with two of his sons and two of his grandchildren the
offspring of his son the Count Guelfo in a tower on the Piazza
of the Anzania caused the tower to be locked the key thrown
into the Arno and all food to be withheld from them In a few
days they died of hunger but the Count first with loud cries
declared his penitence and yet neither priest nor friar was
allowed to shrive him All the five when dead were dragged out
of the prison and meanly interred and from thence forward the
tower was called the tower of famine and so shall ever be

v 6 A windmill The author of the Caliph Vathek in the
notes to that tale justly observes that it is more than
probable that Don Quixotes mistake of the windmills for giants
was suggested to Cervantes by this simile

v 37 Three faces It can scarcely be doubted but that Milton
derived his description of Satan in those lines

 Each passion dimmd his face
 Thrice changd with pale ire envy and despair
 P L b iv 114
from this passage coupled with the remark of Vellutello upon it

The first of these sins is anger which he signifies by the red
face the second represented by that between pale and yellow is
envy and not as others have said avarice and the third
denoted by the black is a melancholy humour that causes a mans
thoughts to be dark and evil and averse from all joy and
tranquillity

PURGATORY


CANTO I


Oer better waves to speed her rapid course
The light bark of my genius lifts the sail
Well pleasd to leave so cruel sea behind
And of that second region will I sing
In which the human spirit from sinful blot
Is purgd and for ascent to Heaven prepares
 Here O ye hallowd Nine for in your train
I follow here the deadened strain revive
Nor let Calliope refuse to sound
A somewhat higher song of that loud tone
Which when the wretched birds of chattering note
Had heard they of forgiveness lost all hope
 Sweet hue of eastern sapphire that was spread
Oer the serene aspect of the pure air
High up as the first circle to mine eyes
Unwonted joy renewd soon as I scapd
Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom
That had mine eyes and bosom filld with grief
The radiant planet that to love invites
Made all the orient laugh and veild beneath
The Pisces light that in his escort came
 To the right hand I turnd and fixd my mind
On the other pole attentive where I saw
Four stars neer seen before save by the ken
Of our first parents Heaven of their rays
Seemd joyous O thou northern site bereft
Indeed and widowd since of these deprivd
 As from this view I had desisted straight
Turning a little towrds the other pole
There from whence now the wain had disappeard
I saw an old man standing by my side
Alone so worthy of revrence in his look
That neer from son to father more was owd
Low down his beard and mixd with hoary white
Descended like his locks which parting fell
Upon his breast in double fold The beams
Of those four luminaries on his face
So brightly shone and with such radiance clear
Deckd it that I beheld him as the sun
 Say who are ye that stemming the blind stream
Forth from th eternal prisonhouse have fled
He spoke and moved those venerable plumes
Who hath conducted or with lantern sure
Lights you emerging from the depth of night
That makes the infernal valley ever black
Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss
Broken or in high heaven new laws ordaind
That thus condemnd ye to my caves approach
 My guide then laying hold on me by words
And intimations given with hand and head
Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay
Due reverence then thus to him replied
 Not of myself I come a Dame from heaven
Descending had besought me in my charge
To bring But since thy will implies that more
Our true condition I unfold at large
Mine is not to deny thee thy request
This mortal neer hath seen the farthest gloom
But erring by his folly had approachd
So near that little space was left to turn
Then as before I told I was dispatchd
To work his rescue and no way remaind
Save this which I have taen I have displayd
Before him all the regions of the bad
And purpose now those spirits to display
That under thy command are purgd from sin
How I have brought him would be long to say
From high descends the virtue by whose aid
I to thy sight and hearing him have led
Now may our coming please thee In the search
Of liberty he journeys that how dear
They know who for her sake have life refusd
Thou knowest to whom death for her was sweet
In Utica where thou didst leave those weeds
That in the last great day will shine so bright
For us the eternal edicts are unmovd
He breathes and I am free of Minos power
Abiding in that circle where the eyes
Of thy chaste Marcia beam who still in look
Prays thee O hallowd spirit to own her shine
Then by her love we implore thee let us pass
Through thy sevn regions for which best thanks
I for thy favour will to her return
If mention there below thou not disdain
 Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found
He then to him rejoind while I was there
That all she askd me I was fain to grant
Now that beyond the accursed stream she dwells
She may no longer move me by that law
Which was ordaind me when I issued thence
Not so if Dame from heaven as thou sayst
Moves and directs thee then no flattery needs
Enough for me that in her name thou ask
Go therefore now and with a slender reed
See that thou duly gird him and his face
Lave till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence
For not with eye by any cloud obscurd
Would it be seemly before him to come
Who stands the foremost minister in heaven
This islet all around there far beneath
Where the wave beats it on the oozy bed
Produces store of reeds No other plant
Coverd with leaves or hardend in its stalk
There lives not bending to the waters sway
After this way return not but the sun
Will show you that now rises where to take
The mountain in its easiest ascent
 He disappeard and I myself upraisd
Speechless and to my guide retiring close
Toward him turnd mine eyes He thus began
My son observant thou my steps pursue
We must retreat to rearward for that way
The champain to its low extreme declines
 The dawn had chasd the matin hour of prime
Which deaf before it so that from afar
I spyd the trembling of the ocean stream
 We traversd the deserted plain as one
Who wanderd from his track thinks every step
Trodden in vain till he regain the path
 When we had come where yet the tender dew
Strove with the sun and in a place where fresh
The wind breathd oer it while it slowly dried
Both hands extended on the watery grass
My master placd in graceful act and kind
Whence I of his intent before apprizd
Stretchd out to him my cheeks suffusd with tears
There to my visage he anew restord
That hue which the dun shades of hell conceald
 Then on the solitary shore arrivd
That never sailing on its waters saw
Man that could after measure back his course
He girt me in such manner as had pleasd
Him who instructed and O strange to tell
As he selected every humble plant
Wherever one was pluckd another there
Resembling straightway in its place arose



CANTO II

Now had the sun to that horizon reachd
That covers with the most exalted point
Of its meridian circle Salems walls
And night that opposite to him her orb
Sounds from the stream of Ganges issued forth
Holding the scales that from her hands are droppd
When she reigns highest so that where I was
Auroras white and vermeiltincturd cheek
To orange turnd as she in age increasd
 Meanwhile we lingerd by the waters brink
Like men who musing on their road in thought
Journey while motionless the body rests
When lo as near upon the hour of dawn
Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam
Glares down in west over the ocean floor
So seemd what once again I hope to view
A light so swiftly coming through the sea
No winged course might equal its career
From which when for a space I had withdrawn
Thine eyes to make inquiry of my guide
Again I lookd and saw it grown in size
And brightness thou on either side appeard
Something but what I knew not of bright hue
And by degrees from underneath it came
Another My preceptor silent yet
Stood while the brightness that we first discernd
Opend the form of wings then when he knew
The pilot cried aloud Down down bend low
Thy knees behold Gods angel fold thy hands
Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed
Lo how all human means he sets at naught
So that nor oar he needs nor other sail
Except his wings between such distant shores
Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them reard
Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes
That not like mortal hairs fall off or change
 As more and more toward us came more bright
Appeard the bird of God nor could the eye
Endure his splendor near I mine bent down
He drove ashore in a small bark so swift
And light that in its course no wave it drank
The heavnly steersman at the prow was seen
Visibly written blessed in his looks
Within a hundred spirits and more there sat
In Exitu Israel de Aegypto
All with one voice together sang with what
In the remainder of that hymn is writ
Then soon as with the sign of holy cross
He blessd them they at once leapd out on land
The swiftly as he came returnd The crew
There left appeard astounded with the place
Gazing around as one who sees new sights
 From every side the sun darted his beams
And with his arrowy radiance from mid heavn
Had chasd the Capricorn when that strange tribe
Lifting their eyes towards us If ye know
Declare what path will Lead us to the mount
 Them Virgil answerd Ye suppose perchance
Us well acquainted with this place but here
We as yourselves are strangers Not long erst
We came before you but a little space
By other road so rough and hard that now
The ascent will seem to us as play The spirits
Who from my breathing had perceivd I livd
Grew pale with wonder As the multitude
Flock round a herald sent with olive branch
To hear what news he brings and in their haste
Tread one another down een so at sight
Of me those happy spirits were fixd each one
Forgetful of its errand to depart
Where cleansd from sin it might be made all fair
 Then one I saw darting before the rest
With such fond ardour to embrace me I
To do the like was movd O shadows vain
Except in outward semblance thrice my hands
I claspd behind it they as oft returnd
Empty into my breast again Surprise
I needs must think was painted in my looks
For that the shadow smild and backward drew
To follow it I hastend but with voice
Of sweetness it enjoind me to desist
Then who it was I knew and prayd of it
To talk with me it would a little pause
It answered Thee as in my mortal frame
I lovd so loosd forth it I love thee still
And therefore pause but why walkest thou here
 Not without purpose once more to return
Thou findst me my Casella where I am
Journeying this way I said but how of thee
Hath so much time been lost He answerd straight
No outrage hath been done to me if he
Who when and whom he chooses takes me oft
This passage hath denied since of just will
His will he makes These three months past indeed
He whose chose to enter with free leave
Hath taken whence I wandring by the shore
Where Tybers wave grows salt of him gaind kind
Admittance at that rivers mouth towrd which
His wings are pointed for there always throng
All such as not to Archeron descend
 Then I If new laws have not quite destroyd
Memory and use of that sweet song of love
That while all my cares had power to swage
Please thee with it a little to console
My spirit that incumberd with its frame
Travelling so far of pain is overcome
 Love that discourses in my thoughts He then
Began in such soft accents that within
The sweetness thrills me yet My gentle guide
And all who came with him so well were pleasd
That seemd naught else might in their thoughts have room
 Fast fixd in mute attention to his notes
We stood when lo that old man venerable
Exclaiming How is this ye tardy spirits
What negligence detains you loitring here
Run to the mountain to cast off those scales
That from your eyes the sight of God conceal
 As a wild flock of pigeons to their food
Collected blade or tares without their pride
Accustomd and in still and quiet sort
If aught alarm them suddenly desert
Their meal assaild by more important care
So I that newcome troop beheld the song
Deserting hasten to the mountains side
As one who goes yet where he tends knows not
 Nor with less hurried step did we depart



CANTO III

Them sudden flight had scatterd over the plain
Turnd towrds the mountain whither reasons voice
Drives us I to my faithful company
Adhering left it not For how of him
Deprivd might I have sped or who beside
Would oer the mountainous tract have led my steps
He with the bitter pang of selfremorse
Seemd smitten O clear conscience and upright
How doth a little fling wound thee sore
 Soon as his feet desisted slackning pace
From haste that mars all decency of act
My mind that in itself before was wrapt
Its thoughts expanded as with joy restord
And full against the steep ascent I set
My face where highest to heavn its top oerflows
 The sun that flard behind with ruddy beam
Before my form was broken for in me
His rays resistance met I turnd aside
With fear of being left when I beheld
Only before myself the ground obscurd
When thus my solace turning him around
Bespake me kindly Why distrustest thou
Believst not I am with thee thy sure guide
It now is evening there where buried lies
The body in which I cast a shade removd
To Naples from Brundusiums wall Nor thou
Marvel if before me no shadow fall
More than that in the sky element
One ray obstructs not other To endure
Torments of heat and cold extreme like frames
That virtue hath disposd which how it works
Wills not to us should be reveald Insane
Who hopes our reason may that space explore
Which holds three persons in one substance knit
Seek not the wherefore race of human kind
Could ye have seen the whole no need had been
For Mary to bring forth Moreover ye
Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly
To whose desires repose would have been givn
That now but serve them for eternal grief
I speak of Plato and the Stagyrite
And others many more And then he bent
Downwards his forehead and in troubled mood
Broke off his speech Meanwhile we had arrivd
Far as the mountains foot and there the rock
Found of so steep ascent that nimblest steps
To climb it had been vain The most remote
Most wild untrodden path in all the tract
Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this
A ladder easy and open of access
 Who knows on which hand now the steep declines
My master said and pausd so that he may
Ascend who journeys without aid of wine
And while with looks directed to the ground
The meaning of the pathway he explord
And I gazd upward round the stony height
Of spirits that toward us movd their steps
Yet moving seemd not they so slow approachd
 I thus my guide addressd Upraise thine eyes
Lo that way some of whom thou mayst obtain
Counsel if of thyself thou findst it not
 Straightway he lookd and with free speech replied
Let us tend thither they but softly come
And thou be firm in hope my son belovd
 Now was that people distant far in space
A thousand paces behind ours as much
As at a throw the nervous arm could fling
When all drew backward on the messy crags
Of the steep bank and firmly stood unmovd
As one who walks in doubt might stand to look
 O spirits perfect O already chosen
Virgil to them began by that blest peace
Which as I deem is for you all prepard
Instruct us where the mountain low declines
So that attempt to mount it be not vain
For who knows most him loss of time most grieves
 As sheep that step from forth their fold by one
Or pairs or three at once meanwhile the rest
Stand fearfully bending the eye and nose
To ground and what the foremost does that do
The others gathring round her if she stops
Simple and quiet nor the cause discern
So saw I moving to advance the first
Who of that fortunate crew were at the head
Of modest mien and graceful in their gait
When they before me had beheld the light
From my right side fall broken on the ground
So that the shadow reachd the cave they stoppd
And somewhat back retird the same did all
Who followd though unweeting of the cause
 Unaskd of you yet freely I confess
This is a human body which ye see
That the suns light is broken on the ground
Marvel not but believe that not without
Virtue derivd from Heaven we to climb
Over this wall aspire So them bespake
My master and that virtuous tribe rejoind
 Turn and before you there the entrance lies
Making a signal to us with bent hands
 Then of them one began Whoeer thou art
Who journeyst thus this way thy visage turn
Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen
 I towrds him turnd and with fixd eye beheld
Comely and fair and gentle of aspect
He seemd but on one brow a gash was markd
 When humbly I disclaimd to have beheld
Him ever Now behold he said and showd
High on his breast a wound then smiling spake
 I am Manfredi grandson to the Queen
Costanza whence I pray thee when returnd
To my fair daughter go the parent glad
Of Aragonia and Sicilias pride
And of the truth inform her if of me
Aught else be told When by two mortal blows
My frame was shatterd I betook myself
Weeping to him who of free will forgives
My sins were horrible but so wide arms
Hath goodness infinite that it receives
All who turn to it Had this text divine
Been of Cosenzas shepherd better scannd
Who then by Clement on my hunt was set
Yet at the bridges head my bones had lain
Near Benevento by the heavy mole
Protected but the rain now drenches them
And the wind drives out of the kingdoms bounds
Far as the stream of Verde where with lights
Extinguishd he removd them from their bed
Yet by their curse we are not so destroyd
But that the eternal love may turn while hope
Retains her verdant blossoms True it is
That such one as in contumacy dies
Against the holy church though he repent
Must wander thirtyfold for all the time
In his presumption past if such decree
Be not by prayers of good men shorter made
Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss
Revealing to my good Costanza how
Thou hast beheld me and beside the terms
Laid on me of that interdict for here
By means of those below much profit comes


CANTO IV

When by sensations of delight or pain
That any of our faculties hath seizd
Entire the soul collects herself it seems
She is intent upon that power alone
And thus the error is disprovd which holds
The soul not singly lighted in the breast
And therefore when as aught is heard or seen
That firmly keeps the soul toward it turnd
Time passes and a man perceives it not
For that whereby he hearken is one power
Another that which the whole spirit hash
This is as it were bound while that is free
 This found I true by proof hearing that spirit
And wondring for full fifty steps aloft
The sun had measurd unobservd of me
When we arrivd where all with one accord
The spirits shouted Here is what ye ask
 A larger aperture ofttimes is stoppd
With forked stake of thorn by villager
When the ripe grape imbrowns than was the path
By which my guide and I behind him close
Ascended solitary when that troop
Departing left us On Sanleos road
Who journeys or to Noli low descends
Or mounts Bismantuas height must use his feet
But here a man had need to fly I mean
With the swift wing and plumes of high desire
Conducted by his aid who gave me hope
And with light furnishd to direct my way
 We through the broken rock ascended close
Pent on each side while underneath the ground
Askd help of hands and feet When we arrivd
Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank
Where the plain level opend I exclaimd
O master say which way can we proceed
 He answerd Let no step of thine recede
Behind me gain the mountain till to us
Some practisd guide appear That eminence
Was lofty that no eye might reach its point
And the side proudly rising more than line
From the mid quadrant to the centre drawn
I wearied thus began Parent belovd
Turn and behold how I remain alone
If thou stay not  My son He straight replyd
Thus far put forth thy strength and to a track
Pointed that on this side projecting round
Circles the hill His words so spurrd me on
That I behind him clambring forcd myself
Till my feet pressd the circuit plain beneath
There both together seated turnd we round
To eastward whence was our ascent and oft
Many beside have with delight lookd back
 First on the nether shores I turnd my eyes
Then raisd them to the sun and wondring markd
That from the left it smote us Soon perceivd
That Poet sage how at the car of light
Amazd I stood where twixt us and the north
Its course it enterd Whence he thus to me
Were Ledas offspring now in company
Of that broad mirror that high up and low
Imparts his light beneath thou mightst behold
The ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears
Wheel if its ancient course it not forsook
How that may be if thou wouldst think within
Pondring imagine Sion with this mount
Placd on the earth so that to both be one
Horizon and two hemispheres apart
Where lies the path that Phaeton ill knew
To guide his erring chariot thou wilt see
How of necessity by this on one
He passes while by that on the other side
If with clear view shine intellect attend
 Of truth kind teacher I exclaimd so clear
Aught saw I never as I now discern
Where seemd my ken to fail that the mid orb
Of the supernal motion which in terms
Of art is called the Equator and remains
Ever between the sun and winter for the cause
Thou hast assignd from hence toward the north
Departs when those who in the Hebrew land
Inhabit see it towrds the warmer part
But if it please thee I would gladly know
How far we have to journey for the hill
Mounts higher than this sight of mine can mount
 He thus to me Such is this steep ascent
That it is ever difficult at first
But more a man proceeds less evil grows
When pleasant it shall seem to thee so much
That upward going shall be easy to thee
As in a vessel to go down the tide
Then of this path thou wilt have reachd the end
There hope to rest thee from thy toil No more
I answer and thus far for certain know
As he his words had spoken near to us
A voice there sounded Yet ye first perchance
May to repose you by constraint be led
At sound thereof each turnd and on the left
A huge stone we beheld of which nor I
Nor he before was ware Thither we drew
find there were some who in the shady place
Behind the rock were standing as a man
Thru idleness might stand Among them one
Who seemd to me much wearied sat him down
And with his arms did fold his knees about
Holding his face between them downward bent
 Sweet Sir I cryd behold that man who shows
Himself more idle than if laziness
Were sister to him Straight he turnd to us
And oer the thigh lifting his face observd
Then in these accents spake Up then proceed
Thou valiant one Straight who it was I knew
Nor could the pain I felt for want of breath
Still somewhat urgd me hinder my approach
And when I came to him he scarce his head
Uplifted saying Well hast thou discernd
How from the left the sun his chariot leads
 His lazy acts and broken words my lips
To laughter somewhat movd when I began
Belacqua now for thee I grieve no more
But tell why thou art seated upright there
Waitest thou escort to conduct thee hence
Or blame I only shine accustomd ways
Then he My brother of what use to mount
When to my suffering would not let me pass
The bird of God who at the portal sits
Behooves so long that heavn first bear me round
Without its limits as in life it bore
Because I to the end repentant Sighs
Delayd if prayer do not aid me first
That riseth up from heart which lives in grace
What other kind avails not heard in heaven
 Before me now the Poet up the mount
Ascending cried Haste thee for see the sun
Has touchd the point meridian and the night
Now covers with her foot Maroccos shore



CANTO V

Now had I left those spirits and pursued
The steps of my Conductor when beheld
Pointing the finger at me one exclaimd
See how it seems as if the light not shone
From the left hand of him beneath and he
As living seems to be led on Mine eyes
I at that sound reverting saw them gaze
Through wonder first at me and then at me
And the light broken underneath by turns
Why are thy thoughts thus riveted my guide
Exclaimd that thou hast slackd thy pace or how
Imports it thee what thing is whisperd here
Come after me and to their babblings leave
The crowd Be as a tower that firmly set
Shakes not its top for any blast that blows
He in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out
Still of his aim is wide in that the one
Sicklies and wastes to nought the others strength
 What other could I answer save I come
I said it somewhat with that colour tingd
Which ofttimes pardon meriteth for man
 Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came
A little way before us some who sang
The Miserere in responsive Strains
When they perceivd that through my body I
Gave way not for the rays to pass their song
Straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they changd
And two of them in guise of messengers
Ran on to meet us and inquiring askd
Of your condition we would gladly learn
 To them my guide Ye may return and bear
Tidings to them who sent you that his frame
Is real flesh If as I deem to view
His shade they pausd enough is answerd them
Him let them honour they may prize him well
 Neer saw I fiery vapours with such speed
Cut through the serene air at fall of night
Nor Augusts clouds athwart the setting sun
That upward these did not in shorter space
Return and there arriving with the rest
Wheel back on us as with loose rein a troop
 Many exclaimd the bard are these who throng
Around us to petition thee they come
Go therefore on and listen as thou gost
 O spirit who gost on to blessedness
With the same limbs that clad thee at thy birth
Shouting they came a little rest thy step
Look if thou any one amongst our tribe
Hast eer beheld that tidings of him there
Thou mayst report Ah wherefore gost thou on
Ah wherefore tarriest thou not We all
By violence died and to our latest hour
Were sinners but then warnd by light from heavn
So that repenting and forgiving we
Did issue out of life at peace with God
Who with desire to see him fills our heart
 Then I The visages of all I scan
Yet none of ye remember But if aught
That I can do may please you gentle spirits
Speak and I will perform it by that peace
Which on the steps of guide so excellent
Following from world to world intent I seek
 In answer he began None here distrusts
Thy kindness though not promisd with an oath
So as the will fail not for want of power
Whence I who sole before the others speak
Entreat thee if thou ever see that land
Which lies between Romagna and the realm
Of Charles that of thy courtesy thou pray
Those who inhabit Fano that for me
Their adorations duly be put up
By which I may purge off my grievous sins
From thence I came But the deep passages
Whence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt
Upon my bosom in Antenors land
Were made where to be more secure I thought
The author of the deed was Estes prince
Who more than right could warrant with his wrath
Pursued me Had I towards Mira fled
When overtaen at Oriaco still
Might I have breathd But to the marsh I sped
And in the mire and rushes tangled there
Fell and beheld my lifeblood float the plain
 Then said another Ah so may the wish
That takes thee oer the mountain be fulfilld
As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine
Of Montefeltro I Buonconte I
Giovanna nor none else have care for me
Sorrowing with these I therefore go I thus
From Campaldinos field what force or chance
Drew thee that neer thy sepulture was known
 Oh answerd he at Casentinos foot
A stream there courseth namd Archiano sprung
In Apennine above the Hermits seat
Een where its name is canceld there came I
Piercd in the heart fleeing away on foot
And bloodying the plain Here sight and speech
Faild me and finishing with Marys name
I fell and tenantless my flesh remaind
I will report the truth which thou again0
Tell to the living Me Gods angel took
Whilst he of hell exclaimd O thou from heavn
Say wherefore hast thou robbd me Thou of him
Th eternal portion bearst with thee away
For one poor tear that he deprives me of
But of the other other rule I make
 Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects
That vapour dank returning into water
Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it
That evil will which in his intellect
Still follows evil came and raisd the wind
And smoky mist by virtue of the power
Given by his nature Thence the valley soon
As day was spent he coverd oer with cloud
From Pratomagno to the mountain range
And stretchd the sky above so that the air
Impregnate changd to water Fell the rain
And to the fosses came all that the land
Containd not and as mightiest streams are wont
To the great river with such headlong sweep
Rushd that nought stayd its course My stiffend frame
Laid at his mouth the fell Archiano found
And dashd it into Arno from my breast
Loosning the cross that of myself I made
When overcome with pain He hurld me on
Along the banks and bottom of his course
Then in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt
 Ah when thou to the world shalt be returnd
And rested after thy long road so spake
Next the third spirit then remember me
I once was Pia Sienna gave me life
Maremma took it from me That he knows
Who me with jewelld ring had first espousd



CANTO VI

When from their game of dice men separate
He who hath lost remains in sadness fixd
Revolving in his mind what luckless throws
He cast but meanwhile all the company
Go with the other one before him runs
And one behind his mantle twitches one
Fast by his side bids him remember him
He stops not and each one to whom his hand
Is stretchd well knows he bids him stand aside
And thus he from the press defends himself
Een such was I in that closecrowding throng
And turning so my face around to all
And promising I scapd from it with pains
 Here of Arezzo him I saw who fell
By Ghinos cruel arm and him beside
Who in his chase was swallowd by the stream
Here Frederic Novello with his hand
Stretchd forth entreated and of Pisa he
Who put the good Marzuco to such proof
Of constancy Count Orso I beheld
And from its frame a soul dismissd for spite
And envy as it said but for no crime
I speak of Peter de la Brosse and here
While she yet lives that Lady of Brabant
Let her beware lest for so false a deed
She herd with worse than these When I was freed
From all those spirits who prayd for others prayers
To hasten on their state of blessedness
Straight I began O thou my luminary
It seems expressly in thy text denied
That heavens supreme decree can never bend
To supplication yet with this design
Do these entreat Can then their hope be vain
Or is thy saying not to me reveald
 He thus to me Both what I write is plain
And these deceivd not in their hope if well
Thy mind consider that the sacred height
Of judgment doth not stoop because loves flame
In a short moment all fulfils which he
Who sojourns here in right should satisfy
Besides when I this point concluded thus
By praying no defect could be supplied
Because the prayr had none access to God
Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not
Contented unless she assure thee so
Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light
I know not if thou take me right I mean
Beatrice Her thou shalt behold above
Upon this mountains crown fair seat of joy
 Then I Sir let us mend our speed for now
I tire not as before and lo the hill
Stretches its shadow far He answerd thus
Our progress with this day shall be as much
As we may now dispatch but otherwise
Than thou supposest is the truth For there
Thou canst not be ere thou once more behold
Him back returning who behind the steep
Is now so hidden that as erst his beam
Thou dost not break But lo a spirit there
Stands solitary and toward us looks
It will instruct us in the speediest way
 We soon approachd it O thou Lombard spirit
How didst thou stand in high abstracted mood
Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes
It spoke not aught but let us onward pass
Eyeing us as a lion on his watch
I3ut Virgil with entreaty mild advancd
Requesting it to show the best ascent
It answer to his question none returnd
But of our country and our kind of life
Demanded When my courteous guide began
Mantua the solitary shadow quick
Rose towards us from the place in which it stood
And cryd Mantuan I am thy countryman
Sordello Each the other then embracd
 Ah slavish Italy thou inn of grief
Vessel without a pilot in loud storm
Lady no longer of fair provinces
But brothelhouse impure this gentle spirit
Evn from the Pleasant sound of his dear land
Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen
With such glad cheer while now thy living ones
In thee abide not without war and one
Malicious gnaws another ay of those
Whom the same wall and the same moat contains
Seek wretched one around thy seacoasts wide
Then homeward to thy bosom turn and mark
If any part of the sweet peace enjoy
What boots it that thy reins Justinians hand
Befitted if thy saddle be unpressd
Nought doth he now but aggravate thy shame
Ah people thou obedient still shouldst live
And in the saddle let thy Caesar sit
If well thou markedst that which God commands
 Look how that beast to felness hath relapsd
From having lost correction of the spur
Since to the bridle thou hast set thine hand
O German Albert who abandonst her
That is grown savage and unmanageable
When thou shouldst clasp her flanks with forked heels
Just judgment from the stars fall on thy blood
And be it strange and manifest to all
Such as may strike thy successor with dread
For that thy sire and thou have sufferd thus
Through greediness of yonder realms detaind
The garden of the empire to run waste
Come see the Capulets and Montagues
The Philippeschi and Monaldi man
Who carst for nought those sunk in grief and these
With dire suspicion rackd Come cruel one
Come and behold the oppression of the nobles
And mark their injuries and thou mayst see
What safety Santafiore can supply
Come and behold thy Rome who calls on thee
Desolate widow day and night with moans
My Caesar why dost thou desert my side
Come and behold what love among thy people
And if no pity touches thee for us
Come and blush for thine own report For me
If it be lawful O Almighty Power
Who wast in earth for our sakes crucified
Are thy just eyes turnd elsewhere or is this
A preparation in the wondrous depth
Of thy sage counsel made for some good end
Entirely from our reach of thought cut off
So are the Italian cities all oerthrongd
With tyrants and a great Marcellus made
Of every petty factious villager
 My Florence thou mayst well remain unmovd
At this digression which affects not thee
Thanks to thy people who so wisely speed
Many have justice in their heart that long
Waiteth for counsel to direct the bow
Or ere it dart unto its aim but shine
Have it on their lips edge Many refuse
To bear the common burdens readier thine
Answer unealld and cry Behold I stoop
 Make thyself glad for thou hast reason now
Thou wealthy thou at peace thou wisdomfraught
Facts best witness if I speak the truth
Athens and Lacedaemon who of old
Enacted laws for civil arts renownd
Made little progress in improving life
Towrds thee who usest such nice subtlety
That to the middle of November scarce
Reaches the thread thou in October weavst
How many times within thy memory
Customs and laws and coins and offices
Have been by thee renewd and people changd
 If thou rememberst well and canst see clear
Thou wilt perceive thyself like a sick wretch
Who finds no rest upon her down hut oft
Shifting her side short respite seeks from pain




CANTO VII

After their courteous greetings joyfully
Sevn times exchangd Sordello backward drew
Exclaiming Who are ye Before this mount
By spirits worthy of ascent to God
Was sought my bones had by Octavius care
Been buried I am Virgil for no sin
Deprivd of heavn except for lack of faith
 So answerd him in few my gentle guide
 As one who aught before him suddenly
Beholding whence his wonder riseth cries
It is yet is not wavring in belief
Such he appeard then downward bent his eyes
And drawing near with reverential step
Caught him where of mean estate might clasp
His lord Glory of Latium he exclaimd
In whom our tongue its utmost power displayd
Boast of my honord birthplace what desert
Of mine what favour rather undeservd
Shows thee to me If I to hear that voice
Am worthy say if from below thou comst
And from what cloisters paleThrough every orb
Of that sad region he replyd thus far
Am I arrivd by heavnly influence led
And with such aid I come There is a place
There underneath not made by torments sad
But by dun shades alone where mournings voice
Sounds not of anguish sharp but breathes in sighs
There I with little innocents abide
Who by deaths fangs were bitten ere exempt
From human taint There I with those abide
Who the three holy virtues put not on
But understood the rest and without blame
Followd them all But if thou knowst and canst
Direct us how we soonest may arrive
Where Purgatory its true beginning takes
 He answerd thus We have no certain place
Assignd us upwards I may go or round
Far as I can I join thee for thy guide
But thou beholdest now how day declines
And upwards to proceed by night our power
Excels therefore it may be well to choose
A place of pleasant sojourn To the right
Some spirits sit apart retird If thou
Consentest I to these will lead thy steps
And thou wilt know them not without delight
 How chances this was answerd who so wishd
To ascend by night would he be thence debarrd
By other or through his own weakness fail
 The good Sordello then along the ground
Trailing his finger spoke Only this line
Thou shalt not overpass soon as the sun
Hath disappeard not that aught else impedes
Thy going upwards save the shades of night
These with the wont of power perplex the will
With them thou haply mightst return beneath
Or to and fro around the mountains side
Wander while day is in the horizon shut
 My master straight as wondring at his speech
Exclaimd Then lead us quickly where thou sayst
That while we stay we may enjoy delight
 A little space we were removd from thence
When I perceivd the mountain hollowd out
Evn as large valleys hollowd out on earth
 That way the escorting spirit cried we go
Where in a bosom the high bank recedes
And thou await renewal of the day
 Betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path
Led us traverse into the ridges side
Where more than half the sloping edge expires
Refulgent gold and silver thrice refind
And scarlet grain and ceruse Indian wood
Of lucid dye serene fresh emeralds
But newly broken by the herbs and flowers
Placd in that fair recess in color all
Had been surpassd as great surpasses less
Nor nature only there lavishd her hues
But of the sweetness of a thousand smells
A rare and undistinguishd fragrance made
 Salve Regina on the grass and flowers
Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit
Who not beyond the valley could be seen
 Before the westring sun sink to his bed
Began the Mantuan who our steps had turnd
 Mid those desires not that I lead ye on
For from this eminence ye shall discern
Better the acts and visages of all
Than in the nether vale among them mixd
He who sits high above the rest and seems
To have neglected that he should have done
And to the others song moves not his lip
The Emperor Rodolph call who might have heald
The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died
So that by others she revives but slowly
He who with kindly visage comforts him
Swayd in that country where the water springs
That Moldaws river to the Elbe and Elbe
Rolls to the ocean Ottocar his name
Who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth
Than Winceslaus his son a bearded man
Pamperd with rank luxuriousness and ease
And that one with the nose depress who close
In counsel seems with him of gentle look
Flying expird withring the lilys flower
Look there how he doth knock against his breast
The other ye behold who for his cheek
Makes of one hand a couch with frequent sighs
They are the father and the fatherinlaw
Of Gallias bane his vicious life they know
And foul thence comes the grief that rends them thus
 He so robust of limb who measure keeps
In song with him of feature prominent
With evry virtue bore his girdle bracd
And if that stripling who behinds him sits
King after him had livd his virtue then
From vessel to like vessel had been pourd
Which may not of the other heirs be said
By James and Frederick his realms are held
Neither the better heritage obtains
Rarely into the branches of the tree
Doth human worth mount up and so ordains
He who bestows it that as his free gift
It may be calld To Charles my words apply
No less than to his brother in the song
Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess
So much that plant degenerates from its seed
As more than Beatrice and Margaret
Costanza still boasts of her valorous spouse
 Behold the king of simple life and plain
Harry of England sitting there alone
He through his branches better issue spreads
 That one who on the ground beneath the rest
Sits lowest yet his gaze directs aloft
Us William that brave Marquis for whose cause
The deed of Alexandria and his war
Makes Conferrat and Canavese weep



CANTO VIII

Now was the hour that wakens fond desire
In men at sea and melts their thoughtful heart
Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell
And pilgrim newly on his road with love
Thrills if he hear the vesper bell from far
That seems to mourn for the expiring day
When I no longer taking heed to hear
Began with wonder from those spirits to mark
One risen from its seat which with its hand
Audience implord Both palms it joind and raisd
Fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east
As telling God I care for naught beside
 Te Lucis Ante so devoutly then
Came from its lip and in so soft a strain
That all my sense in ravishment was lost
And the rest after softly and devout
Followd through all the hymn with upward gaze
Directed to the bright supernal wheels
 Here reader for the truth makes thine eyes keen
For of so subtle texture is this veil
That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmarkd
 I saw that gentle band silently next
Look up as if in expectation held
Pale and in lowly guise and from on high
I saw forth issuing descend beneath
Two angels with two flameillumind swords
Broken and mutilated at their points
Green as the tender leaves but newly born
Their vesture was the which by wings as green
Beaten they drew behind them fannd in air
A little over us one took his stand
The other lighted on the Opposing hill
So that the troop were in the midst containd
 Well I descried the whiteness on their heads
But in their visages the dazzled eye
Was lost as faculty that by too much
Is overpowerd From Marys bosom both
Are come exclaimd Sordello as a guard
Over the vale ganst him who hither tends
The serpent Whence not knowing by which path
He came I turnd me round and closely pressd
All frozen to my leaders trusted side
 Sordello pausd not To the valley now
For it is time let us descend and hold
Converse with those great shadows haply much
Their sight may please ye Only three steps down
Methinks I measurd ere I was beneath
And noted one who lookd as with desire
To know me Time was now that air arrow dim
Yet not so dim that twixt his eyes and mine
It cleard not up what was conceald before
Mutually towrds each other we advancd
Nino thou courteous judge what joy I felt
When I perceivd thou wert not with the bad
 No salutation kind on either part
Was left unsaid He then inquird How long
Since thou arrivedst at the mountains foot
Over the distant waves O answerd I
Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came
And still in my first life thus journeying on
The other strive to gain Soon as they heard
My words he and Sordello backward drew
As suddenly amazd To Virgil one
The other to a spirit turnd who near
Was seated crying Conrad up with speed
Come see what of his grace high God hath willd
Then turning round to me By that rare mark
Of honour which thou owst to him who hides
So deeply his first cause it hath no ford
When thou shalt he beyond the vast of waves
Tell my Giovanna that for me she call
There where reply to innocence is made
Her mother I believe loves me no more
Since she has changd the white and wimpled folds
Which she is doomd once more with grief to wish
By her it easily may be perceivd
How long in women lasts the flame of love
If sight and touch do not relume it oft
For her so fair a burial will not make
The viper which calls Milan to the field
As had been made by shrill Galluras bird
 He spoke and in his visage took the stamp
Of that right seal which with due temperature
Glows in the bosom My insatiate eyes
Meanwhile to heavn had traveld even there
Where the bright stars are slowest as a wheel
Nearest the axle when my guide inquird
What there aloft my son has caught thy gaze
 I answerd The three torches with which here
The pole is all on fire He then to me
The four resplendent stars thou sawst this morn
Are there beneath and these risn in their stead
 While yet he spoke Sordello to himself
Drew him and cryd Lo there our enemy
And with his hand pointed that way to look
 Along the side where barrier none arose
Around the little vale a serpent lay
Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food
Between the grass and flowers the evil snake
Came on reverting oft his lifted head
And as a beast that smoothes its polishd coat
Licking his hack I saw not nor can tell
How those celestial falcons from their seat
Movd but in motion each one well descried
Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes
The serpent fled and to their stations back
The angels up returnd with equal flight
 The Spirit who to Nino when he calld
Had come from viewing me with fixed ken
Through all that conflict loosend not his sight
 So may the lamp which leads thee up on high
Find in thy destind lot of wax so much
As may suffice thee to the enamels height
It thus began If any certain news
Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part
Thou knowst tell me who once was mighty there
They calld me Conrad Malaspina not
That old one but from him I sprang The love
I bore my people is now here refind
 In your dominions I answerd neer was I
But through all Europe where do those men dwell
To whom their glory is not manifest
The fame that honours your illustrious house
Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land
So that he knows it who was never there
I swear to you so may my upward route
Prosper your honourd nation not impairs
The value of her coffer and her sword
Nature and use give her such privilege
That while the world is twisted from his course
By a bad head she only walks aright
And has the evil way in scorn He then
Now pass thee on sevn times the tired sun
Revisits not the couch which with four feet
The forked Aries covers ere that kind
Opinion shall be naild into thy brain
With stronger nails than others speech can drive
If the sure course of judgment be not stayd



CANTO IX

Now the fair consort of Tithonus old
Arisen from her mates beloved arms
Lookd palely oer the eastern cliff her brow
Lucent with jewels glitterd set in sign
Of that chill animal who with his train
Smites fearful nations and where then we were
Two steps of her ascent the night had past
And now the third was closing up its wing
When I who had so much of Adam with me
Sank down upon the grass oercome with sleep
There where all five were seated In that hour
When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay
Remembring haply ancient grief renews
And with our minds more wandrers from the flesh
And less by thought restraind are as t were full
Of holy divination in their dreams
Then in a vision did I seem to view
A goldenfeatherd eagle in the sky
With open wings and hovring for descent
And I was in that place methought from whence
Young Ganymede from his associates reft
Was snatchd aloft to the high consistory
Perhaps thought I within me here alone
He strikes his quarry and elsewhere disdains
To pounce upon the prey Therewith it seemd
A little wheeling in his airy tour
Terrible as the lightning rushd he down
And snatchd me upward even to the fire
There both I thought the eagle and myself
Did burn and so intense th imagind flames
That needs my sleep was broken off As erst
Achilles shook himself and round him rolld
His wakend eyeballs wondring where he was
Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled
To Scyros with him sleeping in her arms
Een thus I shook me soon as from my face
The slumber parted turning deadly pale
Like one icestruck with dread Solo at my side
My comfort stood and the bright sun was now
More than two hours aloft and to the sea
My looks were turnd Fear not my master cried
Assurd we are at happy point Thy strength
Shrink not but rise dilated Thou art come
To Purgatory now Lo there the cliff
That circling bounds it Lo the entrance there
Where it doth seem disparted Ere the dawn
Usherd the daylight when thy wearied soul
Slept in thee oer the flowery vale beneath
A lady came and thus bespake me I
Am Lucia Suffer me to take this man
Who slumbers Easier so his way shall speed
Sordello and the other gentle shapes
Tarrying she bare thee up and as day shone
This summit reachd and I pursued her steps
Here did she place thee First her lovely eyes
That open entrance showd me then at once
She vanishd with thy sleep Like one whose doubts
Are chasd by certainty and terror turnd
To comfort on discovery of the truth
Such was the change in me and as my guide
Beheld me fearless up along the cliff
He movd and I behind him towards the height
 Reader thou markest how my theme doth rise
Nor wonder therefore if more artfully
I prop the structure Nearer now we drew
Arrivd whence in that part where first a breach
As of a wall appeard I could descry
A portal and three steps beneath that led
For inlet there of different colour each
And one who watchd but spake not yet a word
As more and more mine eye did stretch its view
I markd him seated on the highest step
In visage such as past my power to bear
Graspd in his hand a naked sword glancd back
The rays so toward me that I oft in vain
My sight directed Speak from whence ye stand
He cried What would ye Where is your escort
Take heed your coming upward harm ye not
 A heavenly dame not skilless of these things
Replied the instructor told us even now
Pass that way here the gate is And may she
Befriending prosper your ascent resumd
The courteous keeper of the gate Come then
Before our steps We straightway thither came
 The lowest stair was marble white so smooth
And polishd that therein my mirrord form
Distinct I saw The next of hue more dark
Than sablest grain a rough and singed block
Crackd lengthwise and across The third that lay
Massy above seemd porphyry that flamd
Red as the lifeblood spouting from a vein
On this Gods angel either foot sustaind
Upon the threshold seated which appeard
A rock of diamond Up the trinal steps
My leader cheerily drew me Ask said he
 With humble heart that he unbar the bolt
 Piously at his holy feet devolvd
I cast me praying him for pitys sake
That he would open to me but first fell
Thrice on my bosom prostrate Seven times0
The letter that denotes the inward stain
He on my forehead with the blunted point
Of his drawn sword inscribd And Look he cried
When enterd that thou wash these scars away
 Ashes or earth taen dry out of the ground
Were of one colour with the robe he wore
From underneath that vestment forth he drew
Two keys of metal twain the one was gold
Its fellow silver With the pallid first
And next the burnishd he so plyd the gate
As to content me well Whenever one
Faileth of these that in the keyhole straight
It turn not to this alley then expect
Access in vain Such were the words he spake
One is more precious but the other needs
Skill and sagacity large share of each
Ere its good task to disengage the knot
Be worthily performd From Peter these
I hold of him instructed that I err
Rather in opening than in keeping fast
So but the suppliant at my feet implore
 Then of that hallowd gate he thrust the door
Exclaiming Enter but this warning hear
He forth again departs who looks behind
 As in the hinges of that sacred ward
The swivels turnd sonorous metal strong
Harsh was the grating nor so surlily
Roard the Tarpeian when by force bereft
Of good Metellus thenceforth from his loss
To leanness doomd Attentively I turnd
Listning the thunder that first issued forth
And We praise thee O God methought I heard
In accents blended with sweet melody
The strains came oer mine ear een as the sound
Of choral voices that in solemn chant
With organ mingle and now high and clear
Come swelling now float indistinct away



CANTO X

When we had passed the threshold of the gate
Which the souls ill affection doth disuse
Making the crooked seem the straighter path
I heard its closing sound Had mine eyes turnd
For that offence what plea might have availd
 We mounted up the riven rock that wound
On either side alternate as the wave
Flies and advances Here some little art
Behooves us said my leader that our steps
Observe the varying flexure of the path
 Thus we so slowly sped that with cleft orb
The moon once more oerhangs her watry couch
Ere we that strait have threaded But when free
We came and open where the mount above
One solid mass retires I spent with toil
And both uncertain of the way we stood
Upon a plain more lonesome than the roads
That traverse desert wilds From whence the brink
Borders upon vacuity to foot
Of the steep bank that rises still the space
Had measurd thrice the stature of a man
And distant as mine eye could wing its flight
To leftward now and now to right dispatchd
That cornice equal in extent appeard
 Not yet our feet had on that summit movd
When I discoverd that the bank around
Whose proud uprising all ascent denied
Was marble white and so exactly wrought
With quaintest sculpture that not there alone
Had Polycletus but een natures self
Been shamd The angel who came down to earth
With tidings of the peace so many years
Wept for in vain that opd the heavenly gates
From their long interdict before us seemd
In a sweet act so sculpturd to the life
He lookd no silent image One had sworn
He had said Hail for she was imagd there
By whom the key did open to Gods love
And in her act as sensibly impress
That word Behold the handmaid of the Lord
As figure seald on wax Fix not thy mind
On one place only said the guide belovd
Who had me near him on that part where lies
The heart of man My sight forthwith I turnd
And markd behind the virgin mothers form
Upon that side where he that movd me stood
Another story graven on the rock
 I passed athwart the bard and drew me near
That it might stand more aptly for my view
There in the selfsame marble were engravd
The cart and kine drawing the sacred ark
That from unbidden office awes mankind
Before it came much people and the whole
Parted in seven quires One sense cried Nay
Another Yes they sing Like doubt arose
Betwixt the eye and smell from the curld fume
Of incense breathing up the wellwrought toil
Preceding the blest vessel onward came
With light dance leaping girt in humble guise
Sweet Israels harper in that hap he seemd
Less and yet more than kingly Opposite
At a great palace from the lattice forth
Lookd Michol like a lady full of scorn
And sorrow To behold the tablet next
Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone
I movd me There was storied on the rock
The exalted glory of the Roman prince
Whose mighty worth movd Gregory to earn
His mighty conquest Trajan th Emperor
A widow at his bridle stood attird
In tears and mourning Round about them troopd
Full throng of knights and overhead in gold
The eagles floated struggling with the wind
The wretch appeard amid all these to say
Grant vengeance sire for woe beshrew this heart
My son is murderd He replying seemd
 Wait now till I return And she as one
Made hasty by her grief O sire if thou
Dost not returnWhere I am who then is
May right thee What to thee is others good
If thou neglect thy ownNow comfort thee
At length he answers It beseemeth well
My duty be performd ere I move hence
So justice wills and pity bids me stay
 He whose ken nothing new surveys producd
That visible speaking new to us and strange
The like not found on earth Fondly I gazd
Upon those patterns of meek humbleness
Shapes yet more precious for their artists sake
When Lo the poet whisperd where this way
But slack their pace a multitude advance
These to the lofty steps shall guide us on
 Mine eyes though bent on view of novel sights
Their lovd allurement were not slow to turn
 Reader I would not that amazd thou miss
Of thy good purpose hearing how just God
Decrees our debts be canceld Ponder not
The form of suffring Think on what succeeds
Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom
It cannot pass Instructor I began
What I see hither tending bears no trace
Of human semblance nor of aught beside
That my foild sight can guess He answering thus
So courbd to earth beneath their heavy teems
Of torment stoop they that mine eye at first
Struggled as thine But look intently thither
An disentangle with thy labring view
What underneath those stones approacheth now
Een now mayst thou discern the pangs of each
 Christians and proud O poor and wretched ones
That feeble in the minds eye lean your trust
Upon unstaid perverseness Know ye not
That we are worms yet made at last to form
The winged insect impd with angel plumes
That to heavens justice unobstructed soars
Why buoy ye up aloft your unflegd souls
Abortive then and shapeless ye remain
Like the untimely embryon of a worm
 As to support incumbent floor or roof
For corbel is a figure sometimes seen
That crumples up its knees unto its breast
With the feignd posture stirring ruth unfeignd
In the beholders fancy so I saw
These fashiond when I noted well their guise
 Each as his back was laden came indeed
Or more or less contract but it appeard
As he who showd most patience in his look
Wailing exclaimd I can endure no more



CANTO XI

O thou Almighty Father who dost make
The heavens thy dwelling not in bounds confind
But that with love intenser there thou viewst
Thy primal effluence hallowd be thy name
Join each created being to extol
Thy might for worthy humblest thanks and praise
Is thy blest Spirit May thy kingdoms peace
Come unto us for we unless it come
With all our striving thither tend in vain
As of their will the angels unto thee
Tender meet sacrifice circling thy throne
With loud hosannas so of theirs be done
By saintly men on earth Grant us this day
Our daily manna without which he roams
Through this rough desert retrograde who most
Toils to advance his steps As we to each
Pardon the evil done us pardon thou
Benign and of our merit take no count
Gainst the old adversary prove thou not
Our virtue easily subdud but free
From his incitements and defeat his wiles
This last petition dearest Lord is made
Not for ourselves since that were needless now
But for their sakes who after us remain
 Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring
Those spirits went beneath a weight like that
We sometimes feel in dreams all sore beset
But with unequal anguish wearied all
Round the first circuit purging as they go
The worlds gross darkness off In our behalf
If there vows still be offerd what can here
For them be vowd and done by such whose wills
Have root of goodness in them Well beseems
That we should help them wash away the stains
They carried hence that so made pure and light
They may spring upward to the starry spheres
 Ah so may mercytemperd justice rid
Your burdens speedily that ye have power
To stretch your wing which een to your desire
Shall lift you as ye show us on which hand
Toward the ladder leads the shortest way
And if there be more passages than one
Instruct us of that easiest to ascend
For this man who comes with me and bears yet
The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him
Despite his better will but slowly mounts
From whom the answer came unto these words
Which my guide spake appeard not but twas said
 Along the bank to rightward come with us
And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil
Of living man to climb and were it not
That I am hinderd by the rock wherewith
This arrogant neck is tamd whence needs I stoop
My visage to the ground him who yet lives
Whose name thou speakst not him I fain would view
To mark if eer I knew him and to crave
His pity for the fardel that I bear
I was of Latiun of a Tuscan horn
A mighty one Aldobranlescos name
My sires I know not if ye eer have heard
My old blood and forefathers gallant deeds
Made me so haughty that I clean forgot
The common mother and to such excess
Waxd in my scorn of all men that I fell
Fell therefore by what fate Siennas sons
Each child in Campagnatico can tell
I am Omberto not me only pride
Hath injurd but my kindred all involvd
In mischief with her Here my lot ordains
Under this weight to groan till I appease
Gods angry justice since I did it not
Amongst the living here amongst the dead
 Listning I bent my visage down and one
Not he who spake twisted beneath the weight
That urgd him saw me knew me straight and calld
Holding his eyes With difficulty fixd
Intent upon me stooping as I went
Companion of their way O I exclaimd
 Art thou not Oderigi art not thou
Agobbios glory glory of that art
Which they of Paris call the limmers skill
 Brother said he with tints that gayer smile
Bolognian Francos pencil lines the leaves
His all the honour now mine borrowd light
In truth I had not been thus courteous to him
The whilst I livd through eagerness of zeal
For that preeminence my heart was bent on
Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid
Nor were I even here if able still
To sin I had not turnd me unto God
O powers of man how vain your glory nippd
Een in its height of verdure if an age
Less bright succeed not Cimabue thought
To lord it over paintings field and now
The cry is Giottos and his name eclipsd
Thus hath one Guido from the other snatchd
The letterd prize and he perhaps is born
Who shall drive either from their nest The noise
Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind
That blows from divers points and shifts its name
Shifting the point it blows from Shalt thou more
Live in the mouths of mankind if thy flesh
Part shriveld from thee than if thou hadst died
Before the coral and the pap were left
Or ere some thousand years have passed and that
Is to eternity compard a space
Briefer than is the twinkling of an eye
To the heavens slowest orb He there who treads
So leisurely before me far and wide
Through Tuscany resounded once and now
Is in Sienna scarce with whispers namd
There was he sovreign when destruction caught
The maddning rage of Florence in that day
Proud as she now is loathsome Your renown
Is as the herb whose hue doth come and go
And his might withers it by whom it sprang
Crude from the lap of earth I thus to him
True are thy sayings to my heart they breathe
The kindly spirit of meekness and allay
What tumours rankle there But who is he
Of whom thou spakst but now This he replied
Is Provenzano He is here because
He reachd with grasp presumptuous at the sway
Of all Sienna Thus he still hath gone
Thus goeth neverresting since he died
Such is th acquittance renderd back of him
Who beyond measure dard on earth I then
If soul that to the verge of life delays
Repentance linger in that lower space
Nor hither mount unless good prayers befriend
How chancd admittance was vouchsafd to him
 When at his glorys topmost height said he
Respect of dignity all cast aside
Freely He fixd him on Siennas plain
A suitor to redeem his suffring friend
Who languishd in the prisonhouse of Charles
Nor for his sake refusd through every vein
To tremble More I will not say and dark
I know my words are but thy neighbours soon
Shall help thee to a comment on the text
This is the work that from these limits freed him



CANTO XII

With equal pace as oxen in the yoke
I with that laden spirit journeyd on
Long as the mild instructor sufferd me
But when he bade me quit him and proceed
For here said he behooves with sail and oars
Each man as best he may push on his bark
Upright as one disposd for speed I raisd
My body still in thought submissive bowd
 I now my leaders track not loth pursued
And each had shown how light we fard along
When thus he warnd me Bend thine eyesight down
For thou to ease the way shall find it good
To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet
 As in memorial of the buried drawn
Upon earthlevel tombs the sculpturd form
Of what was once appears at sight whereof
Tears often stream forth by remembrance wakd
Whose sacred stings the piteous only feel
So saw I there but with more curious skill
Of portraiture oerwrought whateer of space
From forth the mountain stretches On one part
Him I beheld above all creatures erst
Created noblest lightning fall from heaven
On th other side with bolt celestial piercd
Briareus cumbring earth he lay through dint
Of mortal icestroke The Thymbraean god
With Mars I saw and Pallas round their sire
Armd still and gazing on the giants limbs
Strewn oer th ethereal field Nimrod I saw
At foot of the stupendous work he stood
As if bewilderd looking on the crowd
Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaars plain
 O Niobe in what a trance of woe
Thee I beheld upon that highway drawn
Sevn sons on either side thee slain O Saul
How ghastly didst thou look on thine own sword
Expiring in Gilboa from that hour
Neer visited with rain from heavn or dew
 O fond Arachne thee I also saw
Half spider now in anguish crawling up
Th unfinishd web thou weavedst to thy bane
 O Rehoboam here thy shape doth seem
Louring no more defiance but fearsmote
With none to chase him in his chariot whirld
 Was shown beside upon the solid floor
How dear Alcmaeon forcd his mother rate
That ornament in evil hour receivd
How in the temple on Sennacherib fell
His sons and how a corpse they left him there
Was shown the scath and cruel mangling made
By Tomyris on Cyrus when she cried
Blood thou didst thirst for take thy fill of blood
Was shown how routed in the battle fled
Th Assyrians Holofernes slain and een
The relics of the carnage Troy I markd
In ashes and in caverns Oh how falln
How abject Ilion was thy semblance there
 What master of the pencil or the style
Had tracd the shades and lines that might have made
The subtlest workman wonder Dead the dead
The living seemd alive with clearer view
His eye beheld not who beheld the truth
Than mine what I did tread on while I went
Low bending Now swell out and with stiff necks
Pass on ye sons of Eve veil not your looks
Lest they descry the evil of your path
 I noted not so busied was my thought
How much we now had circled of the mount
And of his course yet more the sun had spent
When he who with still wakeful caution went
Admonishd Raise thou up thy head for know
Time is not now for slow suspense Behold
That way an angel hasting towards us Lo
Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return
From service on the day Wear thou in look
And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe
That gladly he may forward us aloft
Consider that this day neer dawns again
 Times loss he had so often warnd me gainst
I could not miss the scope at which he aimd
 The goodly shape approachd us snowy white
In vesture and with visage casting streams
Of tremulous lustre like the matin star
His arms he opend then his wings and spake
Onward the steps behold are near and now
Th ascent is without difficulty gaind
 A scanty few are they who when they hear
Such tidings hasten O ye race of men
Though born to soar why suffer ye a wind
So slight to baffle ye He led us on
Where the rock parted here against my front
Did beat his wings then promisd I should fare
In safety on my way As to ascend
That steep upon whose brow the chapel stands
Oer Rubaconte looking lordly down
On the wellguided city up the right
Th impetuous rise is broken by the steps
Carvd in that old and simple age when still
The registry and label rested safe
Thus is th acclivity relievd which here
Precipitous from the other circuit falls
But on each hand the tall cliff presses close
 As entring there we turnd voices in strain
Ineffable sang Blessed are the poor
In spirit Ah how far unlike to these
The straits of hell here songs to usher us
There shrieks of woe We climb the holy stairs
And lighter to myself by far I seemd
Than on the plain before whence thus I spake
Say master of what heavy thing have I
Been lightend that scarce aught the sense of toil
Affects me journeying He in few replied
When sins broad characters that yet remain
Upon thy temples though well nigh effacd
Shall be as one is all clean razed out
Then shall thy feet by heartiness of will
Be so oercome they not alone shall feel
No sense of labour but delight much more
Shall wait them urgd along their upward way
 Then like to one upon whose head is placd
Somewhat he deems not of but from the becks
Of others as they pass him by his hand
Lends therefore help to assure him searches finds
And well performs such office as the eye
Wants power to execute so stretching forth
The fingers of my right hand did I find
Six only of the letters which his sword
Who bare the keys had tracd upon my brow
The leader as he markd mine action smild



CANTO XIII

We reachd the summit of the scale and stood
Upon the second buttress of that mount
Which healeth him who climbs A cornice there
Like to the former girdles round the hill
Save that its arch with sweep less ample bends
 Shadow nor image there is seen all smooth
The rampart and the path reflecting nought
But the rocks sullen hue If here we wait
For some to question said the bard I fear
Our choice may haply meet too long delay
 Then fixedly upon the sun his eyes
He fastnd made his right the central point
From whence to move and turnd the left aside
O pleasant light my confidence and hope
Conduct us thou he cried on this new way
Where now I venture leading to the bourn
We seek The universal world to thee
Owes warmth and lustre If no other cause
Forbid thy beams should ever be our guide
 Far as is measurd for a mile on earth
In brief space had we journeyd such prompt will
Impelld and towards us flying now were heard
Spirits invisible who courteously
Unto loves table bade the welcome guest
The voice that first flew by calld forth aloud
They have no wine  so on behind us past
Those sounds reiterating nor yet lost
In the faint distance when another came
Crying I am Orestes and alike
Wingd its fleet way Oh father I exclaimd
What tongues are these and as I questiond lo
A third exclaiming Love ye those have wrongd you
 This circuit said my teacher knots the scourge
For envy and the cords are therefore drawn
By charitys correcting hand The curb
Is of a harsher sound as thou shalt hear
If I deem rightly ere thou reach the pass
Where pardon sets them free But fix thine eyes
Intently through the air and thou shalt see
A multitude before thee seated each
Along the shelving grot Then more than erst
I opd my eyes before me viewd and saw
Shadows with garments dark as was the rock
And when we passd a little forth I heard
A crying Blessed Mary pray for us
Michael and Peter all ye saintly host
 I do not think there walks on earth this day
Man so remorseless that he hath not yearnd
With pity at the sight that next I saw
Mine eyes a load of sorrow teemed when now
I stood so near them that their semblances
Came clearly to my view Of sackcloth vile
Their covring seemd and on his shoulder one
Did stay another leaning and all leand
Against the cliff Een thus the blind and poor
Near the confessionals to crave an alms
Stand each his head upon his fellows sunk
So most to stir compassion not by sound
Of words alone but that which moves not less
The sight of misry And as never beam
Of noonday visiteth the eyeless man
Een so was heavn a niggard unto these
Of his fair light for through the orbs of all
A thread of wire impiercing knits them up
As for the taming of a haggard hawk
 It were a wrong methought to pass and look
On others yet myself the while unseen
To my sage counsel therefore did I turn
He knew the meaning of the mute appeal
Nor waited for my questioning but said
Speak and be brief be subtle in thy words
 On that part of the cornice whence no rim
Engarlands its steep fall did Virgil come
On the other side me were the spirits their cheeks
Bathing devout with penitential tears
That through the dread impalement forcd a way
 I turnd me to them and O shades said I
 Assurd that to your eyes unveild shall shine
The lofty light sole object of your wish
So may heavens grace clear whatsoeer of foam
Floats turbid on the conscience that thenceforth
The stream of mind roll limpid from its source
As ye declare for so shall ye impart
A boon I dearly prize if any soul
Of Latium dwell among ye and perchance
That soul may profit if I learn so much
 My brother we are each one citizens
Of one true city Any thou wouldst say
Who lived a stranger in Italias land
 So heard I answering as appeald a voice
That onward came some space from whence I stood
 A spirit I noted in whose look was markd
Expectance Ask ye how The chin was raisd
As in one reft of sight Spirit said I
Who for thy rise are tutoring if thou be
That which didst answer to me or by place
Or name disclose thyself that I may know thee
 I was it answerd of Sienna here
I cleanse away with these the evil life
Soliciting with tears that He who is
Vouchsafe him to us Though Sapia namd
In sapience I excelld not gladder far
Of others hurt than of the good befell me
That thou mayst own I now deceive thee not
Hear if my folly were not as I speak it
When now my years slopd waning down the arch
It so bechancd my fellow citizens
Near Colle met their enemies in the field
And I prayd God to grant what He had willd
There were they vanquishd and betook themselves
Unto the bitter passages of flight
I markd the hunt and waxing out of bounds
In gladness lifted up my shameless brow
And like the merlin cheated by a gleam
Cried It is over Heavn I fear thee not
Upon my verge of life I wishd for peace
With God nor repentance had supplied
What I did lack of duty were it not
The hermit Piero touchd with charity
In his devout orisons thought on me
But who art thou that questionst of our state
Who gost to my belief with lids unclosd
And breathest in thy talk Mine eyes said I
May yet be here taen from me but not long
For they have not offended grievously
With envious glances But the woe beneath
Urges my soul with more exceeding dread
That nether load already weighs me down
 She thus Who then amongst us here aloft
Hath brought thee if thou weenest to return
 He answerd I who standeth mute beside me
I live of me ask therefore chosen spirit
If thou desire I yonder yet should move
For thee my mortal feet Oh she replied
This is so strange a thing it is great sign
That God doth love thee Therefore with thy prayer
Sometime assist me and by that I crave
Which most thou covetest that if thy feet
Eer tread on Tuscan soil thou save my fame
Amongst my kindred Them shalt thou behold
With that vain multitude who set their hope
On Telamones haven there to fail
Confounded more shall when the fancied stream
They sought of Dian calld but they who lead
Their navies more than ruind hopes shall mourn


CANTO XIV

Say who is he around our mountain winds
Or ever death has prund his wing for flight
That opes his eyes and covers them at will
 I know not who he is but know thus much
He comes not singly Do thou ask of him
For thou art nearer to him and take heed
Accost him gently so that he may speak
 Thus on the right two Spirits bending each
Toward the other talkd of me then both
Addressing me their faces backward leand
And thus the one began O soul who yet
Pent in the body tendest towards the sky
For charity we pray thee comfort us
Recounting whence thou comst and who thou art
For thou dost make us at the favour shown thee
Marvel as at a thing that neer hath been
 There stretches through the midst of Tuscany
I straight began a brooklet whose wellhead
Springs up in Falterona with his race
Not satisfied when he some hundred miles
Hath measurd From his banks bring I this frame
To tell you who I am were words misspent
For yet my name scarce sounds on rumours lip
 If well I do incorprate with my thought
The meaning of thy speech said he who first
Addrest me thou dost speak of Arnos wave
 To whom the other Why hath he conceald
The title of that river as a man
Doth of some horrible thing The spirit who
Thereof was questiond did acquit him thus
I know not but tis fitting well the name
Should perish of that vale for from the source
Where teems so plenteously the Alpine steep
Maimd of Pelorus that doth scarcely pass
Beyond that limit even to the point
Whereunto ocean is restord what heaven
Drains from th exhaustless store for all earths streams
Throughout the space is virtue worried down
As twere a snake by all for mortal foe
Or through disastrous influence on the place
Or else distortion of misguided wills
That custom goads to evil whence in those
The dwellers in that miserable vale
Nature is so transformd it seems as they
Had shard of Circes feeding Midst brute swine
Worthier of acorns than of other food
Created for mans use he shapeth first
His obscure way then sloping onward finds
Curs snarlers more in spite than power from whom
He turns with scorn aside still journeying down
By how much more the curst and luckless foss
Swells out to largeness een so much it finds
Dogs turning into wolves Descending still
Through yet more hollow eddies next he meets
A race of foxes so replete with craft
They do not fear that skill can master it
Nor will I cease because my words are heard
By other ears than thine It shall be well
For this man if he keep in memory
What from no erring Spirit I reveal
Lo I behold thy grandson that becomes
A hunter of those wolves upon the shore
Of the fierce stream and cows them all with dread
Their flesh yet living sets he up to sale
Then like an aged beast to slaughter dooms
Many of life he reaves himself of worth
And goodly estimation Smeard with gore
Mark how he issues from the rueful wood
Leaving such havoc that in thousand years
It spreads not to prime lustihood again
 As one who tidings hears of woe to come
Changes his looks perturbd from whateer part
The peril grasp him so beheld I change
That spirit who had turnd to listen struck
With sadness soon as he had caught the word
 His visage and the others speech did raise
Desire in me to know the names of both
whereof with meek entreaty I inquird
 The shade who late addrest me thus resumd
Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do
For thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine
But since Gods will is that so largely shine
His grace in thee I will be liberal too
Guido of Duca know then that I am
Envy so parchd my blood that had I seen
A fellow man made joyous thou hadst markd
A livid paleness overspread my cheek
Such harvest reap I of the seed I sowd
O man why place thy heart where there doth need
Exclusion of participants in good
This is Rinieris spirit this the boast
And honour of the house of Calboli
Where of his worth no heritage remains
Nor his the only blood that hath been stript
twixt Po the mount the Reno and the shore
Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss
But in those limits such a growth has sprung
Of rank and venomd roots as long would mock
Slow cultures toil Where is good Lizio where
Manardi Traversalo and Carpigna
O bastard slips of old Romagnas line
When in Bologna the low artisan
And in Faenza yon Bernardin sprouts
A gentle cyon from ignoble stem
Wonder not Tuscan if thou see me weep
When I recall to mind those once lovd names
Guido of Prata and of Azzo him
That dwelt with you Tignoso and his troop
With Traversaros house and Anastagio s
Each race disherited and beside these
The ladies and the knights the toils and ease
That witchd us into love and courtesy
Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts
O Brettinoro wherefore tarriest still
Since forth of thee thy family hath gone
And many hating evil joind their steps
Well doeth he that bids his lineage cease
Bagnacavallo Castracaro ill
And Conio worse who care to propagate
A race of Counties from such blood as theirs
Well shall ye also do Pagani then
When from amongst you tries your demon child
Not so howeer that henceforth there remain
True proof of what ye were O Hugolin
Thou sprung of Fantolinis line thy name
Is safe since none is lookd for after thee
To cloud its lustre warping from thy stock
But Tuscan go thy ways for now I take
Far more delight in weeping than in words
Such pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart
 We knew those gentle spirits at parting heard
Our steps Their silence therefore of our way
Assurd us Soon as we had quitted them
Advancing onward lo a voice that seemd
Like vollied lightning when it rives the air
Met us and shouted Whosoever finds
Will slay me then fled from us as the bolt
Lancd sudden from a downwardrushing cloud
When it had givn short truce unto our hearing
Behold the other with a crash as loud
As the quickfollowing thunder Mark in me
Aglauros turnd to rock I at the sound
Retreating drew more closely to my guide
 Now in mute stillness rested all the air
And thus he spake There was the galling bit
But your old enemy so baits his hook
He drags you eager to him Hence nor curb
Avails you nor reclaiming call Heavn calls
And round about you wheeling courts your gaze
With everlasting beauties Yet your eye
Turns with fond doting still upon the earth
Therefore He smites you who discerneth all



CANTO XV

As much as twixt the third hours close and dawn
Appeareth of heavns sphere that ever whirls
As restless as an infant in his play
So much appeard remaining to the sun
Of his slope journey towards the western goal
 Evening was there and here the noon of night
and full upon our forehead smote the beams
For round the mountain circling so our path
Had led us that toward the sunset now
Direct we journeyd when I felt a weight
Of more exceeding splendour than before
Press on my front The cause unknown amaze
Possessd me and both hands against my brow
Lifting I interposd them as a screen
That of its gorgeous superflux of light
Clippd the diminishd orb As when the ray
Striking On water or the surface clear
Of mirror leaps unto the opposite part
Ascending at a glance een as it fell
And so much differs from the stone that falls
Through equal space as practice skill hath shown
Thus with refracted light before me seemed
The ground there smitten whence in sudden haste
My sight recoild What is this sire belovd
Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain
Cried I and which towards us moving seems
 Marvel not if the family of heavn
He answerd yet with dazzling radiance dim
Thy sense it is a messenger who comes
Inviting mans ascent Such sights ere long
Not grievous shall impart to thee delight
As thy perception is by nature wrought
Up to their pitch The blessed angel soon
As we had reachd him haild us with glad voice
Here enter on a ladder far less steep
Than ye have yet encounterd We forthwith
Ascending heard behind us chanted sweet
Blessed the merciful and happy thou
That conquerst Lonely each my guide and I
Pursued our upward way and as we went
Some profit from his words I hopd to win
And thus of him inquiring framd my speech
 What meant Romagnas spirit when he spake
Of bliss exclusive with no partner shard
 He straight replied No wonder since he knows
What sorrow waits on his own worst defect
If he chide others that they less may mourn
Because ye point your wishes at a mark
Where by communion of possessors part
Is lessend envy bloweth up the sighs of men
No fear of that might touch ye if the love
Of higher sphere exalted your desire
For there by how much more they call it ours
So much propriety of each in good
Increases more and heightend charity
Wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame
 Now lack I satisfaction more said I
Than if thou hadst been silent at the first
And doubt more gathers on my labring thought
How can it chance that good distributed
The many that possess it makes more rich
Than if t were shard by few He answering thus
Thy mind reverting still to things of earth
Strikes darkness from true light The highest good
Unlimited ineffable doth so speed
To love as beam to lucid body darts
Giving as much of ardour as it finds
The sempiternal effluence streams abroad
Spreading wherever charity extends
So that the more aspirants to that bliss
Are multiplied more good is there to love
And more is lovd as mirrors that reflect
Each unto other propagated light
If these my words avail not to allay
Thy thirsting Beatrice thou shalt see
Who of this want and of all else thou hast
Shall rid thee to the full Provide but thou
That from thy temples may be soon erasd
Een as the two already those five scars
That when they pain thee worst then kindliest heal
 Thou I had said contentst me when I saw
The other round was gaind and wondring eyes
Did keep me mute There suddenly I seemd
By an ecstatic vision wrapt away
And in a temple saw methought a crowd
Of many persons and at th entrance stood
A dame whose sweet demeanour did express
A mothers love who said Child why hast thou
Dealt with us thus Behold thy sire and I
Sorrowing have sought thee and so held her peace
And straight the vision fled A female next
Appeard before me down whose visage coursd
Those waters that grief forces out from one
By deep resentment stung who seemd to say
If thou Pisistratus be lord indeed
Over this city namd with such debate
Of adverse gods and whence each science sparkles
Avenge thee of those arms whose bold embrace
Hath claspd our daughter and to fuel meseemd
Benign and meek with visage undisturbd
Her sovran spake How shall we those requite
Who wish us evil if we thus condemn
The man that loves us After that I saw
A multitude in fury burning slay
With stones a stripling youth and shout amain
Destroy destroy and him I saw who bowd
Heavy with death unto the ground yet made
His eyes unfolded upward gates to heavn
Praying forgiveness of th Almighty Sire
Amidst that cruel conflict on his foes
With looks that With compassion to their aim
 Soon as my spirit from her airy flight
Returning sought again the things whose truth
Depends not on her shaping I observd
How she had rovd to no unreal scenes
 Meanwhile the leader who might see I movd
As one who struggles to shake off his sleep
Exclaimd What ails thee that thou canst not hold
Thy footing firm but more than half a league
Hast traveld with closd eyes and tottring gait
Like to a man by wine or sleep oerchargd
 Beloved father so thou deign said I
To listen I will tell thee what appeard
Before me when so faild my sinking steps
 He thus Not if thy Countenance were maskd
With hundred vizards could a thought of thine
How small soeer elude me What thou sawst
Was shown that freely thou mightst ope thy heart
To the waters of peace that flow diffusd
From their eternal fountain I not askd
What ails thee for such cause as he doth who
Looks only with that eye which sees no more
When spiritless the body lies but askd
To give fresh vigour to thy foot Such goads
The slow and loitring need that they be found
Not wanting when their hour of watch returns
 So on we journeyd through the evening sky
Gazing intent far onward as our eyes
With level view could stretch against the bright
Vespertine ray and lo by slow degrees
Gathring a fog made towrds us dark as night
There was no room for scaping and that mist
Bereft us both of sight and the pure air



CANTO XVI

Hells dunnest gloom or night unlustrous dark
Of every planes reft and palld in clouds
Did never spread before the sight a veil
In thickness like that fog nor to the sense
So palpable and gross Entring its shade
Mine eye endured not with unclosed lids
Which marking near me drew the faithful guide
Offering me his shoulder for a stay
 As the blind man behind his leader walks
Lest he should err or stumble unawares
On what might harm him or perhaps destroy
I journeyd through that bitter air and foul
Still listning to my escorts warning voice
Look that from me thou part not Straight I heard
Voices and each one seemd to pray for peace
And for compassion to the Lamb of God
That taketh sins away Their prelude still
Was Agnus Dei and through all the choir
One voice one measure ran that perfect seemd
The concord of their song Are these I hear
Spirits O master I exclaimd and he
Thou aimst aright these loose the bonds of wrath
 Now who art thou that through our smoke dost cleave
And speakst of us as thou thyself een yet
Dividest time by calends So one voice
Bespake me whence my master said Reply
And ask if upward hence the passage lead
 O being who dost make thee pure to stand
Beautiful once more in thy Makers sight
Along with me and thou shalt hear and wonder
Thus I whereto the spirit answering spake
Long as t is lawful for me shall my steps
Follow on thine and since the cloudy smoke
Forbids the seeing hearing in its stead
Shall keep us joind I then forthwith began
Yet in my mortal swathing I ascend
To higher regions and am hither come
Through the fearful agony of hell
And if so largely God hath doled his grace
That clean beside all modern precedent
He wills me to behold his kingly state
From me conceal not who thou wast ere death
Had loosd thee but instruct me and instruct
If rightly to the pass I tend thy words
The way directing as a safe escort
 I was of Lombardy and Marco calld
Not inexperiencd of the world that worth
I still affected from which all have turnd
The nerveless bow aside Thy course tends right
Unto the summit and replying thus
He added I beseech thee pray for me
When thou shalt come aloft And I to him
Accept my faith for pledge I will perform
What thou requirest Yet one doubt remains
That wrings me sorely if I solve it not
Singly before it urgd me doubled now
By thine opinion when I couple that
With one elsewhere declard each strengthning other
The world indeed is even so forlorn
Of all good as thou speakst it and so swarms
With every evil Yet beseech thee point
The cause out to me that myself may see
And unto others show it for in heaven
One places it and one on earth below
 Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh
Brother he thus began the world is blind
And thou in truth comst from it Ye who live
Do so each cause refer to heavn above
Een as its motion of necessity
Drew with it all that moves If this were so
Free choice in you were none nor justice would
There should be joy for virtue woe for ill
Your movements have their primal bent from heaven
Not all yet said I all what then ensues
Light have ye still to follow evil or good
And of the will free power which if it stand
Firm and unwearied in Heavns first assay
Conquers at last so it be cherishd well
Triumphant over all To mightier force
To better nature subject ye abide
Free not constraind by that which forms in you
The reasoning mind uninfluencd of the stars
If then the present race of mankind err
Seek in yourselves the cause and find it there
Herein thou shalt confess me no false spy
 Forth from his plastic hand who charmd beholds
Her image ere she yet exist the soul
Comes like a babe that wantons sportively
Weeping and laughing in its wayward moods
As artless and as ignorant of aught
Save that her Maker being one who dwells
With gladness ever willingly she turns
To whateer yields her joy Of some slight good
The flavour soon she tastes and snard by that
With fondness she pursues it if no guide
Recall no rein direct her wandring course
Hence it behovd the law should be a curb
A sovereign hence behovd whose piercing view
Might mark at least the fortress and main tower
Of the true city Laws indeed there are
But who is he observes them None not he
Who goes before the shepherd of the flock
Who chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof
Therefore the multitude who see their guide
Strike at the very good they covet most
Feed there and look no further Thus the cause
Is not corrupted nature in yourselves
But illconducting that hath turnd the world
To evil Rome that turnd it unto good
Was wont to boast two suns whose several beams
Cast light on either way the worlds and Gods
One since hath quenchd the other and the sword
Is grafted on the crook and so conjoind
Each must perforce decline to worse unawd
By fear of other If thou doubt me mark
The blade each herb is judgd of by its seed
That land through which Adice and the Po
Their waters roll was once the residence
Of courtesy and velour ere the day
That frownd on Frederick now secure may pass
Those limits whosoeer hath left for shame
To talk with good men or come near their haunts
Three aged ones are still found there in whom
The old time chides the new these deem it long
Ere God restore them to a better world
The good Gherardo of Palazzo he
Conrad and Guido of Castello namd
In Gallic phrase more fitly the plain Lombard
On this at last conclude The church of Rome
Mixing two governments that ill assort
Hath missd her footing falln into the mire
And there herself and burden much defild
 O Marco I replied shine arguments
Convince me and the cause I now discern
Why of the heritage no portion came
To Levis offspring But resolve me this
Who that Gherardo is that as thou sayst
Is left a sample of the perishd race
And for rebuke to this untoward age
 Either thy words said he deceive or else
Are meant to try me that thou speaking Tuscan
Appearst not to have heard of good Gherado
The sole addition that by which I know him
Unless I borrowd from his daughter Gaia
Another name to grace him God be with you
I bear you company no more Behold
The dawn with white ray glimmring through the mist
I must awaythe angel comesere he
Appear He said and would not hear me more



CANTO XVII

Call to remembrance reader if thou eer
Hast on a mountain top been taen by cloud
Through which thou sawst no better than the mole
Doth through opacous membrane then wheneer
The watry vapours dense began to melt
Into thin air how faintly the suns sphere
Seemd wading through them so thy nimble thought
May image how at first I rebeheld
The sun that bedward now his couch oerhung
 Thus with my leaders feet still equaling pace
From forth that cloud I came when now expird
The parting beams from off the nether shores
 O quick and forgetive power that sometimes dost
So rob us of ourselves we take no mark
Though round about us thousand trumpets clang
What moves thee if the senses stir not Light
Kindled in heavn spontaneous selfinformd
Or likelier gliding down with swift illapse
By will divine Portrayd before me came
The traces of her dire impiety
Whose form was changd into the bird that most
Delights itself in song and here my mind
Was inwardly so wrapt it gave no place
To aught that askd admittance from without
 Next showerd into my fantasy a shape
As of one crucified whose visage spake
Fell rancour malice deep wherein he died
And round him Ahasuerus the great king
Esther his bride and Mordecai the just
Blameless in word and deed As of itself
That unsubstantial coinage of the brain
Burst like a bubble Which the water fails
That fed it in my vision straight uprose
A damsel weeping loud and cried O queen
O mother wherefore has intemperate ire
Drivn thee to loath thy being Not to lose
Lavinia desprate thou hast slain thyself
Now hast thou lost me I am she whose tears
Mourn ere I fall a mothers timeless end
 Een as a sleep breaks off if suddenly
New radiance strike upon the closed lids
The broken slumber quivering ere it dies
Thus from before me sunk that imagery
Vanishing soon as on my face there struck
The light outshining far our earthly beam
As round I turnd me to survey what place
I had arrivd at Here ye mount exclaimd
A voice that other purpose left me none
Save will so eager to behold who spake
I could not choose but gaze As fore the sun
That weighs our vision down and veils his form
In light transcendent thus my virtue faild
Unequal This is Spirit from above
Who marshals us our upward way unsought
And in his own light shrouds him As a man
Doth for himself so now is done for us
For whoso waits imploring yet sees need
Of his prompt aidance sets himself prepard
For blunt denial ere the suit be made
Refuse we not to lend a ready foot
At such inviting haste we to ascend
Before it darken for we may not then
Till morn again return So spake my guide
And to one ladder both addressd our steps
And the first stair approaching I perceivd
Near me as twere the waving of a wing
That fannd my face and whisperd Blessed they
The peacemakers they know not evil wrath
 Now to such height above our heads were raisd
The last beams followd close by hooded night
That many a star on all sides through the gloom
Shone out Why partest from me O my strength
So with myself I commund for I felt
My oertoild sinews slacken We had reachd
The summit and were fixd like to a bark
Arrivd at land And waiting a short space
If aught should meet mine ear in that new round
Then to my guide I turnd and said Lovd sire
Declare what guilt is on this circle purgd
If our feet rest no need thy speech should pause
 He thus to me The love of good whateer
Wanted of just proportion here fulfils
Here plies afresh the oar that loiterd ill
But that thou mayst yet clearlier understand
Give ear unto my words and thou shalt cull
Some fruit may please thee well from this delay
 Creator nor created being neer
My son he thus began was without love
Or natural or the free spirits growth
Thou hast not that to learn The natural still
Is without error but the other swerves
If on ill object bent or through excess
Of vigour or defect While eer it seeks
The primal blessings or with measure due
Th inferior no delight that flows from it
Partakes of ill But let it warp to evil
Or with more ardour than behooves or less
Pursue the good the thing created then
Works gainst its Maker Hence thou must infer
That love is germin of each virtue in ye
And of each act no less that merits pain
Now since it may not be but love intend
The welfare mainly of the thing it loves
All from selfhatred are secure and since
No being can be thought t exist apart
And independent of the first a bar
Of equal force restrains from hating that
 Grant the distinction just and it remains
The evil must be anothers which is lovd
Three ways such love is genderd in your clay
There is who hopes his neighbours worth deprest
Preeminence himself and coverts hence
For his own greatness that another fall
There is who so much fears the loss of power
Fame favour glory should his fellow mount
Above him and so sickens at the thought
He loves their opposite and there is he
Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame
That he doth thirst for vengeance and such needs
Must doat on others evil Here beneath
This threefold love is mournd Of th other sort
Be now instructed that which follows good
But with disorderd and irregular course
 All indistinctly apprehend a bliss
On which the soul may rest the hearts of all
Yearn after it and to that wished bourn
All therefore strive to tend If ye behold
Or seek it with a love remiss and lax
This cornice after just repenting lays
Its penal torment on ye Other good
There is where man finds not his happiness
It is not true fruition not that blest
Essence of every good the branch and root
The love too lavishly bestowd on this
Along three circles over us is mournd
Account of that division tripartite
Expect not fitter for thine own research



CANTO XVIII

The teacher ended and his high discourse
Concluding earnest in my looks inquird
If I appeard content and I whom still
Unsated thirst to hear him urgd was mute
Mute outwardly yet inwardly I said
Perchance my too much questioning offends
But he true father markd the secret wish
By diffidence restraind and speaking gave
Me boldness thus to speak Master my Sight
Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams
That all thy words convey distinct is seen
Wherefore I pray thee father whom this heart
Holds dearest thou wouldst deign by proof t unfold
That love from which as from their source thou bringst
All good deeds and their opposite He then
To what I now disclose be thy clear ken
Directed and thou plainly shalt behold
How much those blind have errd who make themselves
The guides of men The soul created apt
To love moves versatile which way soeer
Aught pleasing prompts her soon as she is wakd
By pleasure into act Of substance true
Your apprehension forms its counterfeit
And in you the ideal shape presenting
Attracts the souls regard If she thus drawn
incline toward it love is that inclining
And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye
Then as the fire points up and mounting seeks
His birthplace and his lasting seat een thus
Enters the captive soul into desire
Which is a spiritual motion that neer rests
Before enjoyment of the thing it loves
Enough to show thee how the truth from those
Is hidden who aver all love a thing
Praiseworthy in itself although perhaps
Its substance seem still good Yet if the wax
Be good it follows not th impression must
What love is I returnd thy words O guide
And my own docile mind reveal Yet thence
New doubts have sprung For from without if love
Be offerd to us and the spirit knows
No other footing tend she right or wrong
Is no desert of hers He answering thus
What reason here discovers I have power
To show thee that which lies beyond expect
From Beatrice faith not reasons task
Spirit substantial form with matter joind
Not in confusion mixd hath in itself
Specific virtue of that union born
Which is not felt except it work nor provd
But through effect as vegetable life
By the green leaf From whence his intellect
Deduced its primal notices of things
Man therefore knows not or his appetites
Their first affections such in you as zeal
In bees to gather honey at the first
Volition meriting nor blame nor praise
But oer each lower faculty supreme
That as she list are summond to her bar
Ye have that virtue in you whose just voice
Uttereth counsel and whose word should keep
The threshold of assent Here is the source
Whence cause of merit in you is derivd
Een as the affections good or ill she takes
Or severs winnowd as the chaff Those men
Who reasning went to depth profoundest markd
That innate freedom and were thence inducd
To leave their moral teaching to the world
Grant then that from necessity arise
All love that glows within you to dismiss
Or harbour it the powr is in yourselves
Remember Beatrice in her style
Denominates free choice by eminence
The noble virtue if in talk with thee
She touch upon that theme The moon well nigh
To midnight hour belated made the stars
Appear to wink and fade and her broad disk
Seemd like a crag on fire as up the vault
That course she journeyd which the sun then warms
When they of Rome behold him at his set
Betwixt Sardinia and the Corsic isle
And now the weight that hung upon my thought
Was lightend by the aid of that clear spirit
Who raiseth Andes above Mantuas name
I therefore when my questions had obtaind
Solution plain and ample stood as one
Musing in dreary slumber but not long
Slumberd for suddenly a multitude
The steep already turning from behind
Rushd on With fury and like random rout
As echoing on their shores at midnight heard
Ismenus and Asopus for his Thebes
If Bacchus help were needed so came these
Tumultuous curving each his rapid step
By eagerness impelld of holy love
 Soon they oertook us with such swiftness movd
The mighty crowd Two spirits at their head
Cried weeping Blessed Mary sought with haste
The hilly region Caesar to subdue
Ilerda darted in Marseilles his sting
And flew to SpainOh tarry not away
The others shouted let not time be lost
Through slackness of affection Hearty zeal
To serve reanimates celestial grace
 O ye in whom intenser fervency
Haply supplies where lukewarm erst ye faild
Slow or neglectful to absolve your part
Of good and virtuous this man who yet lives
Credit my tale though strange desires t ascend
So morning rise to light us Therefore say
Which hand leads nearest to the rifted rock
 So spake my guide to whom a shade returnd
Come after us and thou shalt find the cleft
We may not linger such resistless will
Speeds our unwearied course Vouchsafe us then
Thy pardon if our duty seem to thee
Discourteous rudeness In Verona I
Was abbot of San Zeno when the hand
Of Barbarossa graspd Imperial sway
That name neer utterd without tears in Milan
And there is he hath one foot in his grave
Who for that monastery ere long shall weep
Ruing his power misusd for that his son
Of body ill compact and worse in mind
And born in evil he hath set in place
Of its true pastor Whether more he spake
Or here was mute I know not he had sped
Een now so far beyond us Yet thus much
I heard and in remembrance treasurd it
 He then who never faild me at my need
Cried Hither turn Lo two with sharp remorse
Chiding their sin In rear of all the troop
These shouted First they died to whom the sea
Opend or ever Jordan saw his heirs
And they who with Aeneas to the end
Endurd not suffering for their portion chose
Life without glory Soon as they had fled
Past reach of sight new thought within me rose
By others followd fast and each unlike
Its fellow till led on from thought to thought
And pleasurd with the fleeting train mine eye
Was closd and meditation changd to dream


CANTO XIX

It was the hour when of diurnal heat
No reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon
Oerpowerd by earth or planetary sway
Of Saturn and the geomancer sees
His Greater Fortune up the east ascend
Where gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone
When fore me in my dream a womans shape
There came with lips that stammerd eyes aslant
Distorted feet hands maimd and colour pale
 I lookd upon her and as sunshine cheers
Limbs numbd by nightly cold een thus my look
Unloosd her tongue next in brief space her form
Decrepit raisd erect and faded face
With loves own hue illumd Recovring speech
She forthwith warbling such a strain began
That I how loth soeer could scarce have held
Attention from the song I thus she sang
I am the Siren she whom mariners
On the wide sea are wilderd when they hear
Such fulness of delight the listner feels
I from his course Ulysses by my lay
Enchanted drew Whoeer frequents me once
Parts seldom so I charm him and his heart
Contented knows no void Or ere her mouth
Was closd to shame her at her side appeard
A dame of semblance holy With stern voice
She utterd Say O Virgil who is this
Which hearing he approachd with eyes still bent
Toward that goodly presence th other seizd her
And her robes tearing opend her before
And showd the belly to me whence a smell
Exhaling loathsome wakd me Round I turnd
Mine eyes and thus the teacher At the least
Three times my voice hath calld thee Rise begone
Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass
 I straightway rose Now day pourd down from high
Filld all the circuits of the sacred mount
And as we journeyd on our shoulder smote
The early ray I followd stooping low
My forehead as a man oerchargd with thought
Who bends him to the likeness of an arch
That midway spans the flood when thus I heard
Come enter here in tone so soft and mild
As never met the ear on mortal strand
 With swanlike wings dispread and pointing up
Who thus had spoken marshald us along
Where each side of the solid masonry
The sloping walls retird then movd his plumes
And fanning us affirmd that those who mourn
Are blessed for that comfort shall be theirs
 What aileth thee that still thou lookst to earth
Began my leader while th angelic shape
A little over us his station took
 New vision I replied hath raisd in me
8urmisings strange and anxious doubts whereon
My soul intent allows no other thought
Or room or entranceHast thou seen said he
That old enchantress her whose wiles alone
The spirits oer us weep for Hast thou seen
How man may free him of her bonds Enough
Let thy heels spurn the earth and thy raisd ken
Fix on the lure which heavns eternal King
Whirls in the rolling spheres As on his feet
The falcon first looks down then to the sky
Turns and forth stretches eager for the food
That woos him thither so the call I heard
So onward far as the dividing rock
Gave way I journeyd till the plain was reachd
 On the fifth circle when I stood at large
A race appeard before me on the ground
All downward lying prone and weeping sore
My soul hath cleaved to the dust I heard
With sighs so deep they well nigh choakd the words
O ye elect of God whose penal woes
Both hope and justice mitigate direct
Towrds the steep rising our uncertain way
 If ye approach secure from this our doom
Prostrationand would urge your course with speed
See that ye still to rightward keep the brink
 So them the bard besought and such the words
Beyond us some short space in answer came
 I noted what remaind yet hidden from them
Thence to my lieges eyes mine eyes I bent
And he forthwith interpreting their suit
Beckond his glad assent Free then to act
As pleasd me I drew near and took my stand
Oer that shade whose words I late had markd
And Spirit I said in whom repentant tears
Mature that blessed hour when thou with God
Shalt find acceptance for a while suspend
For me that mightier care Say who thou wast
Why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone
And if in aught ye wish my service there
Whence living I am come He answering spake
The cause why Heavn our back toward his cope
Reverses shalt thou know but me know first
The successor of Peter and the name
And title of my lineage from that stream
That twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws
His limpid waters through the lowly glen
A month and little more by proof I learnt
With what a weight that robe of sovreignty
Upon his shoulder rests who from the mire
Would guard it that each other fardel seems
But feathers in the balance Late alas
Was my conversion but when I became
Romes pastor I discernd at once the dream
And cozenage of life saw that the heart
Rested not there and yet no prouder height
Lurd on the climber wherefore of that life
No more enamourd in my bosom love
Of purer being kindled For till then
I was a soul in misery alienate
From God and covetous of all earthly things
Now as thou seest here punishd for my doting
Such cleansing from the taint of avarice
Do spirits converted need This mount inflicts
No direr penalty Een as our eyes
Fastend below nor eer to loftier clime
Were lifted thus hath justice leveld us
Here on the earth As avarice quenchd our love
Of good without which is no working thus
Here justice holds us prisond hand and foot
Chaind down and bound while heavens just Lord shall please
So long to tarry motionless outstretchd
 My knees I stoopd and would have spoke but he
Ere my beginning by his ear perceivd
I did him reverence and What cause said he
Hath bowd thee thus Compunction I rejoind
And inward awe of your high dignity
 Up he exclaimd brother upon thy feet
Arise err not thy fellow servant I
Thine and all others of one Sovran Power
If thou hast ever markd those holy sounds
Of gospel truth nor shall be given ill marriage
Thou mayst discern the reasons of my speech
Go thy ways now and linger here no more
Thy tarrying is a let unto the tears
With which I hasten that whereof thou spakst
I have on earth a kinswoman her name
Alagia worthy in herself so ill
Example of our house corrupt her not
And she is all remaineth of me there



CANTO XX

Ill strives the will gainst will more wise that strives
His pleasure therefore to mine own preferrd
I drew the sponge yet thirsty from the wave
 Onward I movd he also onward movd
Who led me coasting still wherever place
Along the rock was vacant as a man
Walks near the battlements on narrow wall
For those on th other part who drop by drop
Wring out their allinfecting malady
Too closely press the verge Accurst be thou
Inveterate wolf whose gorge ingluts more prey
Than every beast beside yet is not filld
So bottomless thy maw Ye spheres of heaven
To whom there are as seems who attribute
All change in mortal state when is the day
Of his appearing for whom fate reserves
To chase her hence With wary steps and slow
We passd and I attentive to the shades
Whom piteously I heard lament and wail
And midst the wailing one before us heard
Cry out O blessed Virgin as a dame
In the sharp pangs of childbed and How poor
Thou wast it added witness that low roof
Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down
O good Fabricius thou didst virtue choose
With poverty before great wealth with vice
 The words so pleasd me that desire to know
The spirit from whose lip they seemd to come
Did draw me onward Yet it spake the gift
Of Nicholas which on the maidens he
Bounteous bestowd to save their youthful prime
Unblemishd Spirit who dost speak of deeds
So worthy tell me who thou was I said
And why thou dost with single voice renew
Memorial of such praise That boon vouchsafd
Haply shall meet reward if I return
To finish the Short pilgrimage of life
Still speeding to its close on restless wing
 I answerd he will tell thee not for hell
Which thence I look for but that in thyself
Grace so exceeding shines before thy time
Of mortal dissolution I was root
Of that ill plant whose shade such poison sheds
Oer all the Christian land that seldom thence
Good fruit is gatherd Vengeance soon should come
Had Ghent and Douay Lille and Bruges power
And vengeance I of heavns great Judge implore
Hugh Capet was I high from me descend
The Philips and the Louis of whom France
Newly is governd born of one who plyd
The slaughterers trade at Paris When the race
Of ancient kings had vanishd all save one
Wrapt up in sable weeds within my gripe
I found the reins of empire and such powers
Of new acquirement with full store of friends
That soon the widowd circlet of the crown
Was girt upon the temples of my son
He from whose bones th anointed race begins
Till the great dower of Provence had removd
The stains that yet obscurd our lowly blood
Its sway indeed was narrow but howeer
It wrought no evil there with force and lies
Began its rapine after for amends
Poitou it seizd Navarre and Gascony
To Italy came Charles and for amends
Young Conradine an innocent victim slew
And sent th angelic teacher back to heavn
Still for amends I see the time at hand
That forth from France invites another Charles
To make himself and kindred better known
Unarmd he issues saving with that lance
Which the archtraitor tilted with and that
He carries with so home a thrust as rives
The bowels of poor Florence No increase
Of territory hence but sin and shame
Shall be his guerdon and so much the more
As he more lightly deems of such foul wrong
I see the other who a prisoner late
Had steps on shore exposing to the mart
His daughter whom he bargains for as do
The Corsairs for their slaves O avarice
What canst thou more who hast subdued our blood
So wholly to thyself they feel no care
Of their own flesh To hide with direr guilt
Past ill and future lo the flowerdeluce
Enters Alagna in his Vicar Christ
Himself a captive and his mockery
Acted again Lo to his holy lip
The vinegar and gall once more applied
And he twixt living robbers doomd to bleed
Lo the new Pilate of whose cruelty
Such violence cannot fill the measure up
With no degree to sanction pushes on
Into the temple his yet eager sails
 O sovran Master when shall I rejoice
To see the vengeance which thy wrath wellpleasd
In secret silence broodsWhile daylight lasts
So long what thou didst hear of her sole spouse
Of the Great Spirit and on which thou turndst
To me for comment is the general theme
Of all our prayers but when it darkens then
A different strain we utter then record
Pygmalion whom his gluttonous thirst of gold
Made traitor robber parricide the woes
Of Midas which his greedy wish ensued
Markd for derision to all future times
And the fond Achan how he stole the prey
That yet he seems by Joshuas ire pursued
Sapphira with her husband next we blame
And praise the forefeet that with furious ramp
Spurnd Heliodorus All the mountain round
Rings with the infamy of Thracias king
Who slew his Phrygian charge and last a shout
Ascends Declare O Crassus for thou knowst
The flavour of thy gold The voice of each
Now high now low as each his impulse prompts
Is led through many a pitch acute or grave
Therefore not singly I erewhile rehearsd
That blessedness we tell of in the day
But near me none beside his accent raisd
 From him we now had parted and essayd
With utmost efforts to surmount the way
When I did feel as nodding to its fall
The mountain tremble whence an icy chill
Seizd on me as on one to death conveyd
So shook not Delos when Latona there
Couchd to bring forth the twinborn eyes of heaven
 Forthwith from every side a shout arose
So vehement that suddenly my guide
Drew near and cried Doubt not while I conduct thee
Glory all shouted such the sounds mine ear
Gatherd from those who near me swelld the sounds
Glory in the highest be to God We stood
Immovably suspended like to those
The shepherds who first heard in Bethlehems field
That song till ceasd the trembling and the song
Was ended then our hallowd path resumd
Eying the prostrate shadows who renewd
Their customd mourning Never in my breast
Did ignorance so struggle with desire
Of knowledge if my memory do not err
As in that moment nor through haste dard I
To question nor myself could aught discern
So on I fard in thoughtfulness and dread



CANTO XXI

The natural thirst neer quenchd but from the well
Whereof the woman of Samaria cravd
Excited haste along the cumberd path
After my guide impelld and pity movd
My bosom for the vengeful deed though just
When lo even as Luke relates that Christ
Appeard unto the two upon their way
Newrisen from his vaulted grave to us
A shade appeard and after us approachd
Contemplating the crowd beneath its feet
We were not ware of it so first it spake
Saying God give you peace my brethren then
Sudden we turnd and Virgil such salute
As fitted that kind greeting gave and cried
Peace in the blessed council be thy lot
Awarded by that righteous court which me
To everlasting banishment exiles
 How he exclaimd nor from his speed meanwhile
Desisting If that ye be spirits whom God
Vouchsafes not room above who up the height
Has been thus far your guide To whom the bard
If thou observe the tokens which this man
Tracd by the finger of the angel bears
Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just
He needs must share But sithence she whose wheel
Spins day and night for him not yet had drawn
That yarn which on the fatal distaff pild
Clotho apportions to each wight that breathes
His soul that sister is to mine and thine
Not of herself could mount for not like ours
Her ken whence I from forth the ample gulf
Of hell was taen to lead him and will lead
Far as my lore avails But if thou know
Instruct us for what cause the mount erewhile
Thus shook and trembled wherefore all at once
Seemd shouting even from his wavewashd foot
 That questioning so tallied with my wish
The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
Een from expectance He forthwith replied
In its devotion nought irregular
This mount can witness or by punctual rule
Unsanctiond here from every change exempt
Other than that which heaven in itself
Doth of itself receive no influence
Can reach us Tempest none shower hail or snow
Hoar frost or dewy moistness higher falls
Than that brief scale of threefold steps thick clouds
Nor scudding rack are ever seen swift glance
Neer lightens nor Thaumantian Iris gleams
That yonder often shift on each side heavn
Vapour adust doth never mount above
The highest of the trinal stairs whereon
Peters vicegerent stands Lower perchance
With various motion rockd trembles the soil
But here through wind in earths deep hollow pent
I know not how yet never trembled then
Trembles when any spirit feels itself
So purified that it may rise or move
For rising and such loud acclaim ensues
Purification by the will alone
Is provd that free to change society
Seizes the soul rejoicing in her will
Desire of bliss is present from the first
But strong propension hinders to that wish
By the just ordinance of heavn opposd
Propension now as eager to fulfil
Th allotted torment as erewhile to sin
And I who in this punishment had lain
Five hundred years and more but now have felt
Free wish for happier clime Therefore thou feltst
The mountain tremble and the spirits devout
Heardst over all his limits utter praise
To that liege Lord whom I entreat their joy
To hasten Thus he spake and since the draught
Is grateful ever as the thirst is keen
No words may speak my fullness of content
 Now said the instructor sage I see the net
That takes ye here and how the toils are loosd
Why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice
Vouchsafe that from thy lips I next may learn
Who on the earth thou wast and wherefore here
So many an age wert prostrate In that time
When the good Titus with Heavns King to help
Avengd those piteous gashes whence the blood
By Judas sold did issue with the name
Most lasting and most honourd there was I
Abundantly renownd the shade replyd
Not yet with faith endued So passing sweet
My vocal Spirit from Tolosa Rome
To herself drew me where I merited
A myrtle garland to inwreathe my brow
Statius they name me still Of Thebes I sang
And next of great Achilles but i th way
Fell with the second burthen Of my flame
Those sparkles were the seeds which I derivd
From the bright fountain of celestial fire
That feeds unnumberd lamps the song I mean
Which sounds Aeneas wandrings that the breast
I hung at that the nurse from whom my veins
Drank inspiration whose authority
Was ever sacred with me To have livd
Coeval with the Mantuan I would bide
The revolution of another sun
Beyond my stated years in banishment
 The Mantuan when he heard him turnd to me
And holding silence by his countenance
Enjoind me silence but the power which wills
Bears not supreme control laughter and tears
Follow so closely on the passion prompts them
They wait not for the motions of the will
In natures most sincere I did but smile
As one who winks and thereupon the shade
Broke off and peerd into mine eyes where best
Our looks interpret So to good event
Mayst thou conduct such great emprize he cried
Say why across thy visage beamd but now
The lightning of a smile On either part
Now am I straitend one conjures me speak
Th other to silence binds me whence a sigh
I utter and the sigh is heard Speak on 
The teacher cried and do not fear to speak
But tell him what so earnestly he asks
Whereon I thus Perchance O ancient spirit
Thou marvelst at my smiling There is room
For yet more wonder He who guides my ken
On high he is that Mantuan led by whom
Thou didst presume of men arid gods to sing
If other cause thou deemdst for which I smild
Leave it as not the true one and believe
Those words thou spakst of him indeed the cause
 Now down he bent t embrace my teachers feet
But he forbade him Brother do it not
Thou art a shadow and beholdst a shade
He rising answerd thus Now hast thou provd
The force and ardour of the love I bear thee
When I forget we are but things of air
And as a substance treat an empty shade



CANTO XXII

Now we had left the angel who had turnd
To the sixth circle our ascending step
One gash from off my forehead razd while they
Whose wishes tend to justice shouted forth
Blessed and ended with I thirst and I
More nimble than along the other straits
So journeyd that without the sense of toil
I followd upward the swiftfooted shades
When Virgil thus began Let its pure flame
From virtue flow and love can never fail
To warm anothers bosom so the light
Shine manifestly forth Hence from that hour
When mongst us in the purlieus of the deep
Came down the spirit of Aquinums hard
Who told of thine affection my good will
Hath been for thee of quality as strong
As ever linkd itself to one not seen
Therefore these stairs will now seem short to me
But tell me and if too secure I loose
The rein with a friends license as a friend
Forgive me and speak now as with a friend
How chancd it covetous desire could find
Place in that bosom midst such ample store
Of wisdom as thy zeal had treasurd there
 First somewhat movd to laughter by his words
Statius replied Each syllable of thine
Is a dear pledge of love Things oft appear
That minister false matters to our doubts
When their true causes are removd from sight
Thy question doth assure me thou believst
I was on earth a covetous man perhaps
Because thou foundst me in that circle placd
Know then I was too wide of avarice
And een for that excess thousands of moons
Have waxd and wand upon my sufferings
And were it not that I with heedful care
Noted where thou exclaimst as if in ire
With human nature Why thou cursed thirst
Of gold dost not with juster measure guide
The appetite of mortals I had met
The fierce encounter of the voluble rock
Then was I ware that with too ample wing
The hands may haste to lavishment and turnd
As from my other evil so from this
In penitence How many from their grave
Shall with shorn locks arise who living aye
And at lifes last extreme of this offence
Through ignorance did not repent And know
The fault which lies direct from any sin
In level opposition here With that
Wastes its green rankness on one common heap
Therefore if I have been with those who wail
Their avarice to cleanse me through reverse
Of their transgression such hath been my lot
 To whom the sovran of the pastoral song
While thou didst sing that cruel warfare wagd
By the twin sorrow of Jocastas womb
From thy discourse with Clio there it seems
As faith had not been shine without the which
Good deeds suffice not And if so what sun
Rose on thee or what candle piercd the dark
That thou didst after see to hoist the sail
And follow where the fisherman had led
 He answering thus By thee conducted first
I enterd the Parnassian grots and quaffd
Of the clear spring illumind first by thee
Opend mine eyes to God Thou didst as one
Who journeying through the darkness hears a light
Behind that profits not himself but makes
His followers wise when thou exclaimedst Lo
A renovated world Justice returnd
Times of primeval innocence restord
And a new race descended from above
Poet and Christian both to thee I owed
That thou mayst mark more clearly what I trace
My hand shall stretch forth to inform the lines
With livelier colouring Soon oer all the world
By messengers from heavn the true belief
Teemd now prolific and that word of thine
Accordant to the new instructors chimd
Inducd by which agreement I was wont
Resort to them and soon their sanctity
So won upon me that Domitians rage
Pursuing them I mixd my tears with theirs
And while on earth I stayd still succourd them
And their most righteous customs made me scorn
All sects besides Before I led the Greeks
In tuneful fiction to the streams of Thebes
I was baptizd but secretly through fear
Remaind a Christian and conformd long time
To Pagan rites Five centuries and more
T for that lukewarmness was fain to pace
Round the fourth circle Thou then who hast raisd
The covering which did hide such blessing from me
Whilst much of this ascent is yet to climb
Say if thou know where our old Terence bides
Caecilius Plautus Varro if condemnd
They dwell and in what province of the deep
These said my guide with Persius and myself
And others many more are with that Greek
Of mortals the most cherishd by the Nine
In the first ward of darkness There ofttimes
We of that mount hold converse on whose top
For aye our nurses live We have the bard
Of Pella and the Teian Agatho
Simonides and many a Grecian else
Ingarlanded with laurel Of thy train
Antigone is there Deiphile
Argia and as sorrowful as erst
Ismene and who showd Langias wave
Deidamia with her sisters there
And blind Tiresias daughter and the bride
Seaborn of Peleus Either poet now
Was silent and no longer by th ascent
Or the steep walls obstructed round them cast
Inquiring eyes Four handmaids of the day
Had finishd now their office and the fifth
Was at the chariotbeam directing still
Its balmy point aloof when thus my guide
Methinks it well behooves us to the brink
Bend the right shoulder circuiting the mount
As we have ever usd So custom there
Was usher to the road the which we chose
Less doubtful as that worthy shade complied
 They on before me went I sole pursued
Listning their speech that to my thoughts conveyd
Mysterious lessons of sweet poesy
But soon they ceasd for midway of the road
A tree we found with goodly fruitage hung
And pleasant to the smell and as a fir
Upward from bough to bough less ample spreads
So downward this less ample spread that none
Methinks aloft may climb Upon the side
That closd our path a liquid crystal fell
From the steep rock and through the sprays above
Streamd showering With associate step the bards
Drew near the plant and from amidst the leaves
A voice was heard Ye shall be chary of me
And after added Mary took more thought
For joy and honour of the nuptial feast
Than for herself who answers now for you
The women of old Rome were satisfied
With water for their beverage Daniel fed
On pulse and wisdom gaind The primal age
Was beautiful as gold and hunger then
Made acorns tasteful thirst each rivulet
Run nectar Honey and locusts were the food
Whereon the Baptist in the wilderness
Fed and that eminence of glory reachd
And greatness which the Evangelist records



CANTO XXIII

On the green leaf mine eyes were fixd like his
Who throws away his days in idle chase
Of the diminutive when thus I heard
The more than father warn me Son our time
Asks thriftier using Linger not away
 Thereat my face and steps at once I turnd
Toward the sages by whose converse cheerd
I journeyd on and felt no toil and lo
A sound of weeping and a song My lips
O Lord and these so mingled it gave birth
To pleasure and to pain O Sire belovd
Say what is this I hear Thus I inquird
 Spirits said he who as they go perchance
Their debt of duty pay As on their road
The thoughtful pilgrims overtaking some
Not known unto them turn to them and look
But stay not thus approaching from behind
With speedier motion eyed us as they passd
A crowd of spirits silent and devout
The eyes of each were dark and hollow pale
Their visage and so lean withal the bones
Stood staring thro the skin I do not think
Thus dry and meagre Erisicthon showd
When pinced by sharpset famine to the quick
 Lo to myself I musd the race who lost
Jerusalem when Mary with dire beak
Preyd on her child The sockets seemd as rings
From which the gems were drops Who reads the name
Of man upon his forehead there the M
Had tracd most plainly Who would deem that scent
Of water and an apple could have provd
Powerful to generate such pining want
Not knowing how it wrought While now I stood
Wondring what thus could waste them for the cause
Of their gaunt hollowness and scaly rind
Appeard not lo a spirit turnd his eyes
In their deepsunken cell and fastend then
On me then cried with vehemence aloud
What grace is this vouchsafd me By his looks
I neer had recognizd him but the voice
Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceald
Remembrance of his alterd lineaments
Was kindled from that spark and I agnizd
The visage of Forese Ah respect
This wan and leprous witherd skin thus he
Suppliant implord this macerated flesh
Speak to me truly of thyself And who
Are those twain spirits that escort thee there
Be it not said thou Scornst to talk with me
 That face of thine I answerd him which dead
I once bewaild disposes me not less
For weeping when I see It thus transformd
Say then by Heavn what blasts ye thus The whilst
I wonder ask not Speech from me unapt
Is he to speak whom other will employs
 He thus The water and tee plant we passd
Virtue possesses by th eternal will
Infusd the which so pines me Every spirit
Whose song bewails his gluttony indulgd
Too grossly here in hunger and in thirst
Is purified The odour which the fruit
And spray that showers upon the verdure breathe
Inflames us with desire to feed and drink
Nor once alone encompassing our route
We come to add fresh fuel to the pain
Pain said I solace rather for that will
To the tree leads us by which Christ was led
To call Elias joyful when he paid
Our ransom from his vein I answering thus
Forese from that day in which the world
For better life thou changedst not five years
Have circled If the power of sinning more
Were first concluded in thee ere thou knewst
That kindly grief which reespouses us
To God how hither art thou come so soon
I thought to find thee lower there where time
Is recompense for time He straight replied
To drink up the sweet wormwood of affliction
I have been brought thus early by the tears
Streamd down my Nellas cheeks Her prayers devout
Her sighs have drawn me from the coast where oft
Expectance lingers and have set me free
From th other circles In the sight of God
So much the dearer is my widow prizd
She whom I lovd so fondly as she ranks
More singly eminent for virtuous deeds
The tract most barbrous of Sardinias isle
Hath dames more chaste and modester by far
Than that wherein I left her O sweet brother
What wouldst thou have me say A time to come
Stands full within my view to which this hour
Shall not be counted of an ancient date
When from the pulpit shall be loudly warnd
Th unblushing dames of Florence lest they bare
Unkerchiefd bosoms to the common gaze
What savage women hath the world eer seen
What Saracens for whom there needed scourge
Of spiritual or other discipline
To force them walk with covring on their limbs
But did they see the shameless ones that Heavn
Wafts on swift wing toward them while I speak
Their mouths were opd for howling they shall taste
Of Borrow unless foresight cheat me here
Or ere the cheek of him be clothd with down
Who is now rockd with lullaby asleep
Ah now my brother hide thyself no more
Thou seest how not I alone but all
Gaze where thou veilst the intercepted sun
 Whence I replied If thou recall to mind
What we were once together even yet
Remembrance of those days may grieve thee sore
That I forsook that life was due to him
Who there precedes me some few evenings past
When she was round who shines with sister lamp
To his that glisters yonder and I showd
The sun Tis he who through profoundest night
Of he true dead has brought me with this flesh
As true that follows From that gloom the aid
Of his sure comfort drew me on to climb
And climbing wind along this mountainsteep
Which rectifies in you whateer the world
Made crooked and depravd I have his word
That he will bear me company as far
As till I come where Beatrice dwells
But there must leave me Virgil is that spirit
Who thus hath promisd and I pointed to him
The other is that shade for whom so late
Your realm as he arose exulting shook
Through every pendent cliff and rocky bound



CANTO XXIV

Our journey was not slackend by our talk
Nor yet our talk by journeying Still we spake
And urgd our travel stoutly like a ship
When the wind sits astern The shadowy forms
That seemd things dead and dead again drew in
At their deepdelved orbs rare wonder of me
Perceiving I had life and I my words
Continued and thus spake He journeys up
Perhaps more tardily then else he would
For others sake But tell me if thou knowst
Where is Piccarda Tell me if I see
Any of mark among this multitude
Who eye me thusMy sister she for whom
Twixt beautiful and good I cannot say
Which name was fitter  wears een now her crown
And triumphs in Olympus Saying this
He added Since spare diet hath so worn
Our semblance out t is lawful here to name
Each one  This and his finger then he raisd
Is BuonaggiunaBuonaggiuna he
Of Lucca and that face beyond him piercd
Unto a leaner fineness than the rest
Had keeping of the church he was of Tours
And purges by wan abstinence away
Bolsenas eels and cups of muscadel
 He showd me many others one by one
And all as they were namd seemd well content
For no dark gesture I discernd in any
I saw through hunger Ubaldino grind
His teeth on emptiness and Boniface
That wavd the crozier oer a numrous flock
I saw the Marquis who tad time erewhile
To swill at Forli with less drought yet so
Was one neer sated I howeer like him
That gazing midst a crowd singles out one
So singled him of Lucca for methought
Was none amongst them took such note of me
Somewhat I heard him whisper of Gentucca
The sound was indistinct and murmurd there
Where justice that so strips them fixd her sting
 Spirit said I it seems as thou wouldst fain
Speak with me Let me hear thee Mutual wish
To converse prompts which let us both indulge
 He answring straight began Woman is born
Whose brow no wimple shades yet that shall make
My city please thee blame it as they may
Go then with this forewarning If aught false
My whisper too implied th event shall tell
But say if of a truth I see the man
Of that new lay th inventor which begins
With Ladies ye that con the lore of love
 To whom I thus Count of me but as one
Who am the scribe of love that when he breathes
Take up my pen and as he dictates write
 Brother said he the hindrance which once held
The notary with Guittone and myself
Short of that new and sweeter style I hear
Is now disclosd I see how ye your plumes
Stretch as th inditer guides them which no question
Ours did not He that seeks a grace beyond
Sees not the distance parts one style from other
And as contented here he held his peace
 Like as the bird that winter near the Nile
In squared regiment direct their course
Then stretch themselves in file for speedier flight
Thus all the tribe of spirits as they turnd
Their visage faster deaf nimble alike
Through leanness and desire And as a man
Tird With the motion of a trotting steed
Slacks pace and stays behind his company
Till his oerbreathed lungs keep temperate time
Een so Forese let that holy crew
Proceed behind them lingering at my side
And saying When shall I again behold thee
 How long my life may last said I I know not
This know how soon soever I return
My wishes will before me have arrivd
Sithence the place where I am set to live
Is day by day more scoopd of all its good
And dismal ruin seems to threaten it
 Go now he cried lo he whose guilt is most
Passes before my vision draggd at heels
Of an infuriate beast Toward the vale
Where guilt hath no redemption on it speeds
Each step increasing swiftness on the last
Until a blow it strikes that leaveth him
A corse most vilely shatterd No long space
Those wheels have yet to roll therewith his eyes
Lookd up to heavn ere thou shalt plainly see
That which my words may not more plainly tell
I quit thee time is precious here I lose
Too much thus measuring my pace with shine
 As from a troop of wellrankd chivalry
One knight more enterprising than the rest
Pricks forth at gallop eager to display
His prowess in the first encounter provd
So parted he from us with lengthend strides
And left me on the way with those twain spirits
Who were such mighty marshals of the world
 When he beyond us had so fled mine eyes
No nearer reachd him than my thought his words
The branches of another fruit thick hung
And blooming fresh appeard Een as our steps
Turnd thither not far off it rose to view
Beneath it were a multitude that raisd
Their hands and shouted forth I know not What
Unto the boughs like greedy and fond brats
That beg and answer none obtain from him
Of whom they beg but more to draw them on
He at arms length the object of their wish
Above them holds aloft and hides it not
 At length as undeceivd they went their way
And we approach the tree who vows and tears
Sue to in vain the mighty tree Pass on
And come not near Stands higher up the wood
Whereof Eve tasted and from it was taen
this plant Such sounds from midst the thickets came
Whence I with either bard close to the side
That rose passd forth beyond Remember next
We heard those noblest creatures of the clouds
How they their twofold bosoms overgorgd
Opposd in fight to Theseus call to mind
The Hebrews how effeminate they stoopd
To ease their thirst whence Gideons ranks were thinnd
As he to Midian marchd adown the hills
 Thus near one border coasting still we heard
The sins of gluttony with woe erewhile
Reguerdond Then along the lonely path
Once more at large full thousand paces on
We traveld each contemplative and mute
 Why pensive journey thus ye three alone
Thus suddenly a voice exclaimd whereat
I shook as doth a scard and paltry beast
Then raisd my head to look from whence it came
 Was neer in furnace glass or metal seen
So bright and glowing red as was the shape
I now beheld If ye desire to mount
He cried here must ye turn This way he goes
Who goes in quest of peace His countenance
Had dazzled me and to my guides I facd
Backward like one who walks as sound directs
 As when to harbinger the dawn springs up
On freshend wing the air of May and breathes
Of fragrance all impregnd with herb and flowers
Een such a wind I felt upon my front
Blow gently and the moving of a wing
Perceivd that moving shed ambrosial smell
And then a voice Blessed are they whom grace
Doth so illume that appetite in them
Exhaleth no inordinate desire
Still hungring as the rule of temperance wills



CANTO XXV

It was an hour when he who climbs had need
To walk uncrippled for the sun had now
To Taurus the meridian circle left
And to the Scorpion left the night As one
That makes no pause but presses on his road
Whateer betide him if some urgent need
Impel so enterd we upon our way
One before other for but singly none
That steep and narrow scale admits to climb
 Een as the young stork lifteth up his wing
Through wish to fly yet ventures not to quit
The nest and drops it so in me desire
Of questioning my guide arose and fell
Arriving even to the act that marks
A man prepard for speech Him all our haste
Restraind not but thus spake the sire belovd
Fear not to speed the shaft that on thy lip
Stands trembling for its flight Encouragd thus
I straight began How there can leanness come
Where is no want of nourishment to feed
 If thou he answerd hadst rememberd thee
How Meleager with the wasting brand
Wasted alike by equal fires consmd
This would not trouble thee and hadst thou thought
How in the mirror your reflected form
With mimic motion vibrates what now seems
Hard had appeard no harder than the pulp
Of summer fruit mature But that thy will
In certainty may find its full repose
Lo Statius here on him I call and pray
That he would now be healer of thy wound
 If in thy presence I unfold to him
The secrets of heavens vengeance let me plead
Thine own injunction to exculpate me
So Statius answerd and forthwith began
Attend my words O son and in thy mind
Receive them so shall they be light to clear
The doubt thou offerst Blood concocted well
Which by the thirsty veins is neer imbibd
And rests as food superfluous to be taen
From the replenishd table in the heart
Derives effectual virtue that informs
The several human limbs as being that
Which passes through the veins itself to make them
Yet more concocted it descends where shame
Forbids to mention and from thence distils
In natural vessel on anothers blood
Then each unite together one disposd
T endure to act the other through meet frame
Of its recipient mould that being reachd
It gins to work coagulating first
Then vivifies what its own substance causd
To bear With animation now indued
The active virtue differing from a plant
No further than that this is on the way
And at its limit that continues yet
To operate that now it moves and feels
As sea sponge clinging to the rock and there
Assumes th organic powers its seed conveyd
This is the period son at which the virtue
That from the generating heart proceeds
Is pliant and expansive for each limb
Is in the heart by forgeful nature plannd
How babe of animal becomes remains
For thy considring At this point more wise
Than thou hast errd making the soul disjoind
From passive intellect because he saw
No organ for the latters use assignd
 Open thy bosom to the truth that comes
Know soon as in the embryo to the brain
Articulation is complete then turns
The primal Mover with a smile of joy
On such great work of nature and imbreathes
New spirit replete with virtue that what here
Active it finds to its own substance draws
And forms an individual soul that lives
And feels and bends reflective on itself
And that thou less mayst marvel at the word
Mark the suns heat how that to wine doth change
Mixd with the moisture filterd through the vine
 When Lachesis hath spun the thread the soul
Takes with her both the human and divine
Memory intelligence and will in act
Far keener than before the other powers
Inactive all and mute No pause allowd
In wondrous sort selfmoving to one strand
Of those where the departed roam she falls
Here learns her destind path Soon as the place
Receives her round the plastic virtue beams
Distinct as in the living limbs before
And as the air when saturate with showers
The casual beam refracting decks itself
With many a hue so here the ambient air
Weareth that form which influence of the soul
Imprints on it and like the flame that where
The fire moves thither follows so henceforth
The new form on the spirit follows still
Hence hath it semblance and is shadow calld
With each sense even to the sight endued
Hence speech is ours hence laughter tears and sighs
Which thou mayst oft have witnessd on the mount
Th obedient shadow fails not to present
Whatever varying passion moves within us
And this the cause of what thou marvelst at
 Now the last flexure of our way we reachd
And to the right hand turning other care
Awaits us Here the rocky precipice
Hurls forth redundant flames and from the rim
A blast upblown with forcible rebuff
Driveth them back sequesterd from its bound
 Behoovd us one by one along the side
That borderd on the void to pass and I
Feard on one hand the fire on th other feard
Headlong to fall when thus th instructor warnd
Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes
A little swerving and the way is lost
 Then from the bosom of the burning mass
O God of mercy heard I sung and felt
No less desire to turn And when I saw
Spirits along the flame proceeding I
Between their footsteps and mine own was fain
To share by turns my view At the hymns close
They shouted loud I do not know a man
Then in low voice again took up the strain
Which once more ended To the wood they cried
Ran Dian and drave forth Callisto stung
With Cythereas poison then returnd
Unto their song then marry a pair extolld
Who livd in virtue chastely and the bands
Of wedded love Nor from that task I ween
Surcease they whilesoeer the scorching fire
Enclasps them Of such skill appliance needs
To medicine the wound that healeth last



CANTO XXVI

While singly thus along the rim we walkd
Oft the good master warnd me Look thou well
Avail it that I caution thee The sun
Now all the western clime irradiate changd
From azure tinct to white and as I passd
My passing shadow made the umberd flame
Burn ruddier At so strange a sight I markd
That many a spirit marveld on his way
 This bred occasion first to speak of me
He seems said they no insubstantial frame
Then to obtain what certainty they might
Stretchd towards me careful not to overpass
The burning pale O thou who followest
The others haply not more slow than they
But movd by revrence answer me who burn
In thirst and fire nor I alone but these
All for thine answer do more thirst than doth
Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream
Tell us how is it that thou makst thyself
A wall against the sun as thou not yet
Into th inextricable toils of death
Hadst enterd Thus spake one and I had straight
Declard me if attention had not turnd
To new appearance Meeting these there came
Midway the burning path a crowd on whom
Earnestly gazing from each part I view
The shadows all press forward sevrally
Each snatch a hasty kiss and then away
Een so the emmets mid their dusky troops
Peer closely one at other to spy out
Their mutual road perchance and how they thrive
 That friendly greeting parted ere dispatch
Of the first onward step from either tribe
Loud clamour rises those who newly come
Shout Sodom and Gomorrah these The cow
Pasiphae enterd that the beast she wood
Might rush unto her luxury Then as cranes
That part towards the Riphaean mountains fly
Part towards the Lybic sands these to avoid
The ice and those the sun so hasteth off
One crowd advances th other and resume
Their first song weeping and their several shout
 Again drew near my side the very same
Who had erewhile besought me and their looks
Markd eagerness to listen I who twice
Their will had noted spake O spirits secure
Wheneer the time may be of peaceful end
My limbs nor crude nor in mature old age
Have I left yonder here they bear me fed
With blood and sinewstrung That I no more
May live in blindness hence I tend aloft
There is a dame on high who wind for us
This grace by which my mortal through your realm
I bear But may your utmost wish soon meet
Such full fruition that the orb of heaven
Fullest of love and of most ample space
Receive you as ye tell upon my page
Henceforth to stand recorded who ye are
And what this multitude that at your backs
Have past behind us As one mountainbred
Rugged and clownish if some citys walls
He chance to enter round him stares agape
Confounded and struck dumb een such appeard
Each spirit But when rid of that amaze
Not long the inmate of a noble heart
He who before had questiond thus resumd
O blessed who for death preparing takst
Experience of our limits in thy bark
Their crime who not with us proceed was that
For which as he did triumph Caesar heard
The snout of queen to taunt him Hence their cry
Of Sodom as they parted to rebuke
Themselves and aid the burning by their shame
Our sinning was Hermaphrodite but we
Because the law of human kind we broke
Following like beasts our vile concupiscence
Hence parting from them to our own disgrace
Record the name of her by whom the beast
In bestial tire was acted Now our deeds
Thou knowst and how we sinnd If thou by name
Wouldst haply know us time permits not now
To tell so much nor can I Of myself
Learn what thou wishest Guinicelli I
Who having truly sorrowd ere my last
Already cleanse me With such pious joy
As the two sons upon their mother gazd
From sad Lycurgus rescud such my joy
Save that I more represt it when I heard
From his own lips the name of him pronouncd
Who was a father to me and to those
My betters who have ever usd the sweet
And pleasant rhymes of love So nought I heard
Nor spake but long time thoughtfully I went
Gazing on him and only for the fire
Approachd not nearer When my eyes were fed
By looking on him with such solemn pledge
As forces credence I devoted me
Unto his service wholly In reply
He thus bespake me What from thee I hear
Is gravd so deeply on my mind the waves
Of Lethe shall not wash it off nor make
A whit less lively But as now thy oath
Has seald the truth declare what cause impels
That love which both thy looks and speech bewray
 Those dulcet lays I answerd which as long
As of our tongue the beauty does not fade
Shall make us love the very ink that tracd them
 Brother he cried and pointed at a shade
Before him there is one whose mother speech
Doth owe to him a fairer ornament
He in love ditties and the tales of prose
Without a rival stands and lets the fools
Talk on who think the songster of Limoges
Oertops him Rumour and the popular voice
They look to more than truth and so confirm
Opinion ere by art or reason taught
Thus many of the elder time cried up
Guittone giving him the prize till truth
By strength of numbers vanquishd If thou own
So ample privilege as to have gaind
Free entrance to the cloister whereof Christ
Is Abbot of the college say to him
One paternoster for me far as needs
For dwellers in this world where power to sin
No longer tempts us Haply to make way
For one that followd next when that was said
He vanishd through the fire as through the wave
A fish that glances diving to the deep
 I to the spirit he had shown me drew
A little onward and besought his name
For which my heart I said kept gracious room
He frankly thus began Thy courtesy
So wins on me I have nor power nor will
To hide me I am Arnault and with songs
Sorely lamenting for my folly past
Thorough this ford of fire I wade and see
The day I hope for smiling in my view
I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up
Unto the summit of the scale in time
Remember ye my suffrings With such words
He disappeard in the refining flame



CANTO XXVII

Now was the sun so stationd as when first
His early radiance quivers on the heights
Where streamd his Makers blood while Libra hangs
Above Hesperian Ebro and new fires
Meridian flash on Ganges yellow tide
 So day was sinking when the angel of God
Appeard before us Joy was in his mien
Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink
And with a voice whose lively clearness far
Surpassd our human Blessed are the pure
In heart he Sang then near him as we came
Go ye not further holy spirits he cried
Ere the fire pierce you enter in and list
Attentive to the song ye hear from thence
 I when I heard his saying was as one
Laid in the grave My hands together claspd
And upward stretching on the fire I lookd
And busy fancy conjurd up the forms
Erewhile beheld alive consumd in flames
 Th escorting spirits turnd with gentle looks
Toward me and the Mantuan spake My son
Here torment thou mayst feel but canst not death
Remember thee remember thee if I
Safe een on Geryon brought thee now I come
More near to God wilt thou not trust me now
Of this be sure though in its womb that flame
A thousand years containd thee from thy head
No hair should perish If thou doubt my truth
Approach and with thy hands thy vestures hem
Stretch forth and for thyself confirm belief
Lay now all fear O lay all fear aside
Turn hither and come onward undismayd
I still though conscience urgd no step advancd
 When still he saw me fixd and obstinate
Somewhat disturbd he cried Mark now my son
From Beatrice thou art by this wall
Divided As at Thisbes name the eye
Of Pyramus was opend when life ebbd
Fast from his veins and took one parting glance
While vermeil dyed the mulberry thus I turnd
To my sage guide relenting when I heard
The name that springs forever in my breast
 He shook his forehead and How long he said
Linger we now then smild as one would smile
Upon a child that eyes the fruit and yields
Into the fire before me then he walkd
And Statius who erewhile no little space
Had parted us he prayd to come behind
 I would have cast me into molten glass
To cool me when I enterd so intense
Ragd the conflagrant mass The sire belovd
To comfort me as he proceeded still
Of Beatrice talkd Her eyes saith he
Een now I seem to view From the other side
A voice that sang did guide us and the voice
Following with heedful ear we issued forth
There where the path led upward Come we heard
Come blessed of my Father Such the sounds
That haild us from within a light which shone
So radiant I could not endure the view
The sun it added hastes and evening comes
Delay not ere the western sky is hung
With blackness strive ye for the pass Our way
Upright within the rock arose and facd
Such part of heavn that from before my steps
The beams were shrouded of the sinking sun
 Nor many stairs were overpass when now
By fading of the shadow we perceivd
The sun behind us couchd and ere one face
Of darkness oer its measureless expanse
Involvd th horizon and the night her lot
Held individual each of us had made
A stair his pallet not that will but power
Had faild us by the nature of that mount
Forbidden further travel As the goats
That late have skippd and wantond rapidly
Upon the craggy cliffs ere they had taen
Their supper on the herb now silent lie
And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown
While noonday rages and the goatherd leans
Upon his staff and leaning watches them
And as the swain that lodges out all night
In quiet by his flock lest beast of prey
Disperse them even so all three abode
I as a goat and as the shepherds they
Close pent on either side by shelving rock
 A little glimpse of sky was seen above
Yet by that little I beheld the stars
In magnitude and rustle shining forth
With more than wonted glory As I lay
Gazing on them and in that fit of musing
Sleep overcame me sleep that bringeth oft
Tidings of future hap About the hour
As I believe when Venus from the east
First lightend on the mountain she whose orb
Seems always glowing with the fire of love
A lady young and beautiful I dreamd
Was passing oer a lea and as she came
Methought I saw her ever and anon
Bending to cull the flowers and thus she sang
Know ye whoever of my name would ask
That I am Leah for my brow to weave
A garland these fair hands unwearied ply
To please me at the crystal mirror here
I deck me But my sister Rachel she
Before her glass abides the livelong day
Her radiant eyes beholding charmd no less
Than I with this delightful task Her joy
In contemplation as in labour mine
 And now as glimmring dawn appeard that breaks
More welcome to the pilgrim still as he
Sojourns less distant on his homeward way
Darkness from all sides fled and with it fled
My slumber whence I rose and saw my guide
Already risen That delicious fruit
Which through so many a branch the zealous care
Of mortals roams in quest of shall this day
Appease thy hunger Such the words I heard
From Virgils lip and never greeting heard
So pleasant as the sounds Within me straight
Desire so grew upon desire to mount
Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings
Increasing for my flight When we had run
Oer all the ladder to its topmost round
As there we stood on me the Mantuan fixd
His eyes and thus he spake Both fires my son
The temporal and eternal thou hast seen
And art arrivd where of itself my ken
No further reaches I with skill and art
Thus far have drawn thee Now thy pleasure take
For guide Thou hast oercome the steeper way
Oercome the straighter Lo the sun that darts
His beam upon thy forehead lo the herb
The arboreta and flowers which of itself
This land pours forth profuse Till those bright eyes
With gladness come which weeping made me haste
To succour thee thou mayst or seat thee down
Or wander where thou wilt Expect no more
Sanction of warning voice or sign from me
Free of thy own arbitrement to choose
Discreet judicious To distrust thy sense
Were henceforth error I invest thee then
With crown and mitre sovereign oer thyself



CANTO XXVIII

Through that celestial forest whose thick shade
With lively greenness the newspringing day
Attemperd eager now to roam and search
Its limits round forthwith I left the bank
Along the champain leisurely my way
Pursuing oer the ground that on all sides
Delicious odour breathd A pleasant air
That intermitted never never veerd
Smote on my temples gently as a wind
Of softest influence at which the sprays
Obedient all leand trembling to that part
Where first the holy mountain casts his shade
Yet were not so disorderd but that still
Upon their top the featherd quiristers
Applied their wonted art and with full joy
Welcomd those hours of prime and warbled shrill
Amid the leaves that to their jocund lays
inept tenor even as from branch to branch
Along the piney forests on the shore
Of Chiassi rolls the gathring melody
When Eolus hath from his cavern loosd
The dripping south Already had my steps
Though slow so far into that ancient wood
Transported me I could not ken the place
Where I had enterd when behold my path
Was bounded by a rill which to the left
With little rippling waters bent the grass
That issued from its brink On earth no wave
How clean soeer that would not seem to have
Some mixture in itself compard with this
Transpicuous clear yet darkly on it rolld
Darkly beneath perpetual gloom which neer
Admits or sun or moon light there to shine
 My feet advancd not but my wondring eyes
Passd onward oer the streamlet to survey
The tender Maybloom flushd through many a hue
In prodigal variety and there
As object rising suddenly to view
That from our bosom every thought beside
With the rare marvel chases I beheld
A lady all alone who singing went
And culling flower from flower wherewith her way
Was all oer painted Lady beautiful
Thou who if looks that use to speak the heart
Are worthy of our trust with loves own beam
Dost warm thee thus to her my speech I framd
Ah please thee hither towards the streamlet bend
Thy steps so near that I may list thy song
Beholding thee and this fair place methinks
I call to mind where wanderd and how lookd
Proserpine in that season when her child
The mother lost and she the bloomy spring
 As when a lady turning in the dance
Doth foot it featly and advances scarce
One step before the other to the ground
Over the yellow and vermilion flowers
Thus turnd she at my suit most maidenlike
Valing her sober eyes and came so near
That I distinctly caught the dulcet sound
Arriving where the limped waters now
Lavd the green sward her eyes she deignd to raise
That shot such splendour on me as I ween
Neer glanced from Cythereas when her son
Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart
Upon the opposite bank she stood and smild
through her graceful fingers shifted still
The intermingling dyes which without seed
That lofty land unbosoms By the stream
Three paces only were we sunderd yet
The Hellespont where Xerxes passd it oer
A curb for ever to the pride of man
Was by Leander not more hateful held
For floating with inhospitable wave
Twixt Sestus and Abydos than by me
That flood because it gave no passage thence
 Strangers ye come and haply in this place
That cradled human nature in its birth
Wondring ye not without suspicion view
My smiles but that sweet strain of psalmody
Thou Lord hast made me glad will give ye light
Which may uncloud your minds And thou who standst
The foremost and didst make thy suit to me
Say if aught else thou wish to hear for I
Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine
 She spake and I replied l know not how
To reconcile this wave and rustling sound
Of forest leaves with what I late have heard
Of opposite report She answering thus
I will unfold the cause whence that proceeds
Which makes thee wonder and so purge the cloud
That hath enwraps thee The First Good whose joy
Is only in himself created man
For happiness and gave this goodly place
His pledge and earnest of eternal peace
Favourd thus highly through his own defect
He fell and here made short sojourn he fell
And for the bitterness of sorrow changd
Laughter unblamd and evernew delight
That vapours none exhald from earth beneath
Or from the waters which wherever heat
Attracts them follow might ascend thus far
To vex mans peaceful state this mountain rose
So high toward the heavn nor fears the rage
0f elements contending from that part
Exempted where the gate his limit bars
Because the circumambient air throughout
With its first impulse circles still unless
Aught interpose to cheek or thwart its course
Upon the summit which on every side
To visitation of th impassive air
Is open doth that motion strike and makes
Beneath its sway th umbrageous wood resound
And in the shaken plant such power resides
That it impregnates with its efficacy
The voyaging breeze upon whose subtle plume
That wafted flies abroad and th other land
Receiving as t is worthy in itself
Or in the clime that warms it doth conceive
And from its womb produces many a tree
Of various virtue This when thou hast heard
The marvel ceases if in yonder earth
Some plant without apparent seed be found
To fix its fibrous stem And further learn
That with prolific foison of all seeds
This holy plain is filld and in itself
Bears fruit that neer was pluckd on other soil
 The water thou beholdst springs not from vein
As stream that intermittently repairs
And spends his pulse of life but issues forth
From fountain solid undecaying sure
And by the will omnific full supply
Feeds whatsoeer On either side it pours
On this devolvd with power to take away
Remembrance of offence on that to bring
Remembrance back of every good deed done
From whence its name of Lethe on this part
On th other Eunoe both of which must first
Be tasted ere it work the last exceeding
All flavours else Albeit thy thirst may now
Be well contented if I here break off
No more revealing yet a corollary
I freely give beside nor deem my words
Less grateful to thee if they somewhat pass
The stretch of promise They whose verse of yore
The golden age recorded and its bliss
On the Parnassian mountain of this place
Perhaps had dreamd Here was man guiltless here
Perpetual spring and every fruit and this
The farfamd nectar Turning to the bards
When she had ceasd I noted in their looks
A smile at her conclusion then my face
Again directed to the lovely dame



CANTO XXIX

Singing as if enamourd she resumd
And closd the song with Blessed they whose sins
Are coverd Like the woodnymphs then that trippd
Singly across the sylvan shadows one
Eager to view and one to scape the sun
So movd she on against the current up
The verdant rivage I her mincing step
Observing with as tardy step pursued
 Between us not an hundred paces trod
The bank on each side bending equally
Gave me to face the orient Nor our way
Far onward brought us when to me at once
She turnd and cried My brother look and hearken
And lo a sudden lustre ran across
Through the great forest on all parts so bright
I doubted whether lightning were abroad
But that expiring ever in the spleen
That doth unfold it and this during still
And waxing still in splendor made me question
What it might be and a sweet melody
Ran through the luminous air Then did I chide
With warrantable zeal the hardihood
Of our first parent for that there were earth
Stood in obedience to the heavns she only
Woman the creature of an hour endurd not
Restraint of any veil which had she borne
Devoutly joys ineffable as these
Had from the first and long time since been mine
 While through that wilderness of primy sweets
That never fade suspense I walkd and yet
Expectant of beatitude more high
Before us like a blazing fire the air
Under the green boughs glowd and for a song
Distinct the sound of melody was heard
 O ye thrice holy virgins for your sakes
If eer I sufferd hunger cold and watching
Occasion calls on me to crave your bounty
Now through my breast let Helicon his stream
Pour copious and Urania with her choir
Arise to aid me while the verse unfolds
Things that do almost mock the grasp of thought
 Onward a space what seemd seven trees of gold
The intervening distance to mine eye
Falsely presented but when I was come
So near them that no lineament was lost
Of those with which a doubtful object seen
Remotely plays on the misdeeming sense
Then did the faculty that ministers
Discourse to reason these for tapers of gold
Distinguish and it th singing trace the sound
Hosanna Above their beauteous garniture
Flamd with more ample lustre than the moon
Through cloudless sky at midnight in her full
 I turnd me full of wonder to my guide
And he did answer with a countenance
Chargd with no less amazement whence my view
Reverted to those lofty things which came
So slowly moving towards us that the bride
Would have outstript them on her bridal day
 The lady called aloud Why thus yet burns
Affection in thee for these living lights
And dost not look on that which follows them
 I straightway markd a tribe behind them walk
As if attendant on their leaders clothd
With raiment of such whiteness as on earth
Was never On my left the watry gleam
Borrowd and gave me back when there I lookd
As in a mirror my left side portrayd
 When I had chosen on the rivers edge
Such station that the distance of the stream
Alone did separate me there I stayd
My steps for clearer prospect and beheld
The flames go onward leaving as they went
The air behind them painted as with trail
Of liveliest pencils so distinct were markd
All those sevn listed colours whence the sun
Maketh his bow and Cynthia her zone
These streaming gonfalons did flow beyond
My vision and ten paces as I guess
Parted the outermost Beneath a sky
So beautiful came foul andtwenty elders
By two and two with flowerdeluces crownd
All sang one song Blessed be thou among
The daughters of Adam and thy loveliness
Blessed for ever After that the flowers
And the fresh herblets on the opposite brink
Were free from that elected race as light
In heavn doth second light came after them
Four animals each crownd with verdurous leaf
With six wings each was plumd the plumage full
Of eyes and th eyes of Argus would be such
Were they endued with life Reader more rhymes
Will not waste in shadowing forth their form
For other need no straitens that in this
I may not give my bounty room But read
Ezekiel for he paints them from the north
How he beheld them come by Chebars flood
In whirlwind cloud and fire and even such
As thou shalt find them characterd by him
Here were they save as to the pennons there
From him departing John accords with me
 The space surrounded by the four enclosd
A car triumphal on two wheels it came
Drawn at a Gryphons neck and he above
Stretchd either wing uplifted tween the midst
And the three listed hues on each side three
So that the wings did cleave or injure none
And out of sight they rose The members far
As he was bird were golden white the rest
With vermeil interveind So beautiful
A car in Rome neer gracd Augustus pomp
Or Africanus een the suns itself
Were poor to this that chariot of the sun
Erroneous which in blazing ruin fell
At Tellus prayr devout by the just doom
Mysterious of allseeing Jove Three nymphs
k the right wheel came circling in smooth dance
The one so ruddy that her form had scarce
Been known within a furnace of clear flame
The next did look as if the flesh and bones
Were emerald snow newfallen seemd the third
Now seemd the white to lead the ruddy now
And from her song who led the others took
Their treasure swift or slow At th other wheel
A band quaternion each in purple clad
Advancd with festal step as of them one
The rest conducted one upon whose front
Three eyes were seen In rear of all this group
Two old men I beheld dissimilar
In raiment but in port and gesture like
Solid and mainly grave of whom the one
Did show himself some favourd counsellor
Of the great Coan him whom nature made
To serve the costliest creature of her tribe
His fellow markd an opposite intent
Bearing a sword whose glitterance and keen edge
Een as I viewd it with the flood between
Appalld me Next four others I beheld
Of humble seeming and behind them all
One single old man sleeping as he came
With a shrewd visage And these seven each
Like the first troop were habited hut wore
No braid of lilies on their temples wreathd
Rather with roses and each vermeil flower
A sight but little distant might have sworn
That they were all on fire above their brow
 Whenas the car was oer against me straight
Was heard a thundring at whose voice it seemd
The chosen multitude were stayd for there
With the first ensigns made they solemn halt



CANTO XXX

Soon as the polar light which never knows
Setting nor rising nor the shadowy veil
Of other cloud than sin fair ornament
Of the first heavn to duty each one there
Safely convoying as that lower doth
The steersman to his port stood firmly fixd
Forthwith the saintly tribe who in the van
Between the Gryphon and its radiance came
Did turn them to the car as to their rest
And one as if commissiond from above
In holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud
Come spouse from Libanus and all the rest
Took up the songAt the last audit so
The blest shall rise from forth his cavern each
Uplifting lightly his newvested flesh
As on the sacred litter at the voice
Authoritative of that elder sprang
A hundred ministers and messengers
Of life eternal Blessed thou who comst
And O they cried from full hands scatter ye
Unwithring lilies and so saying cast
Flowers over head and round them on all sides
 I have beheld ere now at break of day
The eastern clime all roseate and the sky
Opposd one deep and beautiful serene
And the suns face so shaded and with mists
Attemperd at lids rising that the eye
Long while endurd the sight thus in a cloud
Of flowers that from those hands angelic rose
And down within and outside of the car
Fell showering in white veil with olive wreathd
A virgin in my view appeard beneath
Green mantle robd in hue of living flame
And oer my Spirit that in former days
Within her presence had abode so long
No shuddring terror crept Mine eyes no more
Had knowledge of her yet there movd from her
A hidden virtue at whose touch awakd
The power of ancient love was strong within me
 No sooner on my vision streaming smote
The heavnly influence which years past and een
In childhood thrilld me than towards Virgil I
Turnd me to leftward panting like a babe
That flees for refuge to his mothers breast
If aught have terrified or workd him woe
And would have cried There is no dram of blood
That doth not quiver in me The old flame
Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire
But Virgil had bereavd us of himself
Virgil my bestlovd father Virgil he
To whom I gave me up for safety nor
All our prime mother lost availd to save
My undewd cheeks from blur of soiling tears
 Dante weep not that Virgil leaves thee nay
Weep thou not yet behooves thee feel the edge
Of other sword and thou shalt weep for that
 As to the prow or stern some admiral
Paces the deck inspiriting his crew
When mid the sailyards all hands ply aloof
Thus on the left side of the car I saw
Turning me at the sound of mine own name
Which here I am compelld to register
The virgin stationd who before appeared
Veild in that festive shower angelical
 Towards me across the stream she bent her eyes
Though from her brow the veil descending bound
With foliage of Minerva sufferd not
That I beheld her clearly then with act
Full royal still insulting oer her thrall
Added as one who speaking keepeth back
The bitterest saying to conclude the speech
Observe me well I am in sooth I am
Beatrice What and hast thou deignd at last
Approach the mountain knewest not O man
Thy happiness is whole Down fell mine eyes
On the clear fount but there myself espying
Recoild and sought the greensward such a weight
Of shame was on my forehead With a mien
Of that stern majesty which doth surround
mothers presence to her awestruck child
She lookd a flavour of such bitterness
Was mingled in her pity There her words
Brake off and suddenly the angels sang
In thee O gracious Lord my hope hath been
But went no farther than Thou Lord hast set
My feet in ample room As snow that lies
Amidst the living rafters on the back
Of Italy congeald when drifted high
And closely pild by rough Sclavonian blasts
Breathe but the land whereon no shadow falls
And straightway melting it distils away
Like a firewasted taper thus was I
Without a sigh or tear or ever these
Did sing that with the chiming of heavns sphere
Still in their warbling chime but when the strain
Of dulcet symphony expressd for me
Their soft compassion more than could the words
Virgin why so consumst him then the ice
Congeald about my bosom turnd itself
To spirit and water and with anguish forth
Gushd through the lips and eyelids from the heart
 Upon the chariots right edge still she stood
Immovable and thus addressd her words
To those bright semblances with pity touchd
Ye in th eternal day your vigils keep
So that nor night nor slumber with close stealth
Conveys from you a single step in all
The goings on of life thence with more heed
I shape mine answer for his ear intended
Who there stands weeping that the sorrow now
May equal the transgression Not alone
Through operation of the mighty orbs
That mark each seed to some predestind aim
As with aspect or fortunate or ill
The constellations meet but through benign
Largess of heavnly graces which rain down
From such a height as mocks our vision this man
Was in the freshness of his being such
So gifted virtually that in him
All better habits wondrously had thrivd
The more of kindly strength is in the soil
So much doth evil seed and lack of culture
Mar it the more and make it run to wildness
These looks sometime upheld him for I showd
My youthful eyes and led him by their light
In upright walking Soon as I had reachd
The threshold of my second age and changd
My mortal for immortal then he left me
And gave himself to others When from flesh
To spirit I had risen and increase
Of beauty and of virtue circled me
I was less dear to him and valued less
His steps were turnd into deceitful ways
Following false images of good that make
No promise perfect Nor availd me aught
To sue for inspirations with the which
I both in dreams of night and otherwise
Did call him back of them so little reckd him
Such depth he fell that all device was short
Of his preserving save that he should view
The children of perdition To this end
I visited the purlieus of the dead
And one who hath conducted him thus high
Receivd my supplications urgd with weeping
It were a breaking of Gods high decree
If Lethe should be past and such food tasted
Without the cost of some repentant tear



CANTO XXXI

O Thou her words she thus without delay
Resuming turnd their point on me to whom
They but with lateral edge seemd harsh before
Say thou who standst beyond the holy stream
If this be true A charge so grievous needs
Thine own avowal On my faculty
Such strange amazement hung the voice expird
Imperfect ere its organs gave it birth
 A little space refraining then she spake
What dost thou muse on Answer me The wave
On thy remembrances of evil yet
Hath done no injury A mingled sense
Of fear and of confusion from my lips
Did such a Yea  produce as needed help
Of vision to interpret As when breaks
In act to be dischargd a crossbow bent
Beyond its pitch both nerve and bow oerstretchd
The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark
Thus tears and sighs forth gushing did I burst
Beneath the heavy load and thus my voice
Was slackend on its way She straight began
When my desire invited thee to love
The good which sets a bound to our aspirings
What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain
Did meet thee that thou so shouldst quit the hope
Of further progress or what bait of ease
Or promise of allurement led thee on
Elsewhere that thou elsewhere shouldst rather wait
 A bitter sigh I drew then scarce found voice
To answer hardly to these sounds my lips
Gave utterance wailing Thy fair looks withdrawn
Things present with deceitful pleasures turnd
My steps aside She answering spake Hadst thou
Been silent or denied what thou avowst
Thou hadst not hid thy sin the more such eye
Observes it But wheneer the sinners cheek
Breaks forth into the preciousstreaming tears
Of selfaccusing in our court the wheel
Of justice doth run counter to the edge
Howeer that thou mayst profit by thy shame
For errors past and that henceforth more strength
May arm thee when thou hearst the Sirenvoice
Lay thou aside the motive to this grief
And lend attentive ear while I unfold
How opposite a way my buried flesh
Should have impelld thee Never didst thou spy
In art or nature aught so passing sweet
As were the limbs that in their beauteous frame
Enclosd me and are scatterd now in dust
If sweetest thing thus faild thee with my death
What afterward of mortal should thy wish
Have tempted When thou first hadst felt the dart
Of perishable things in my departing
For better realms thy wing thou shouldst have prund
To follow me and never stoopd again
To bide a second blow for a slight girl
Or other gaud as transient and as vain
The new and inexperiencd bird awaits
Twice it may be or thrice the fowlers aim
But in the sight of one whose plumes are full
In vain the net is spread the arrow wingd
 I stood as children silent and ashamd
Stand listning with their eyes upon the earth
Acknowledging their fault and selfcondemnd
And she resumd If but to hear thus pains thee
Raise thou thy beard and lo what sight shall do
 With less reluctance yields a sturdy holm
Rent from its fibers by a blast that blows
From off the pole or from Iarbas land
Than I at her behest my visage raisd
And thus the face denoting by the beard
I markd the secret sting her words conveyd
 No sooner lifted I mine aspect up
Than downward sunk that vision I beheld
Of goodly creatures vanish and mine eyes
Yet unassurd and wavering bent their light
On Beatrice Towards the animal
Who joins two natures in one form she turnd
And even under shadow of her veil
And parted by the verdant rill that flowd
Between in loveliness appeard as much
Her former self surpassing as on earth
All others she surpassd Remorseful goads
Shot sudden through me Each thing else the more
Its love had late beguild me now the more
I Was loathsome On my heart so keenly smote
The bitter consciousness that on the ground
Oerpowerd I fell and what my state was then
She knows who was the cause When now my strength
Flowd back returning outward from the heart
The lady whom alone I first had seen
I found above me Loose me not she cried
Loose not thy hold and lo had draggd me high
As to my neck into the stream while she
Still as she drew me after swept along
Swift as a shuttle bounding oer the wave
 The blessed shore approaching then was heard
So sweetly Tu asperges me that I
May not remember much less tell the sound
The beauteous dame her arms expanding claspd
My temples and immergd me where t was fit
The wave should drench me and thence raising up
Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs
Presented me so lavd and with their arm
They each did cover me Here are we nymphs
And in the heavn are stars Or ever earth
Was visited of Beatrice we
Appointed for her handmaids tended on her
We to her eyes will lead thee but the light
Of gladness that is in them well to scan
Those yonder three of deeper ken than ours
Thy sight shall quicken Thus began their song
And then they led me to the Gryphons breast
While turnd toward us Beatrice stood
Spare not thy vision We have stationed thee
Before the emeralds whence love erewhile
Hath drawn his weapons on thee As they spake
A thousand fervent wishes riveted
Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes that stood
Still fixd toward the Gryphon motionless
As the sun strikes a mirror even thus
Within those orbs the twofold being shone
For ever varying in one figure now
Reflected now in other Reader muse
How wondrous in my sight it seemd to mark
A thing albeit steadfast in itself
Yet in its imagd semblance mutable
 Full of amaze and joyous while my soul
Fed on the viand whereof still desire
Grows with satiety the other three
With gesture that declard a loftier line
Advancd to their own carol on they came
Dancing in festive ring angelical
 Turn Beatrice was their song O turn
Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one
Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace
Hath measurd Gracious at our prayr vouchsafe
Unveil to him thy cheeks that he may mark
Thy second beauty now conceald O splendour
O sacred light eternal who is he
So pale with musing in Pierian shades
Or with that fount so lavishly imbued
Whose spirit should not fail him in th essay
To represent thee such as thou didst seem
When under cope of the stillchiming heaven
Thou gavst to open air thy charms reveald



CANTO XXXII

Mine eyes with such an eager coveting
Were bent to rid them of their ten years thirst
No other sense was waking and een they
Were fencd on either side from heed of aught
So tangled in its customd toils that smile
Of saintly brightness drew me to itself
When forcibly toward the left my sight
The sacred virgins turnd for from their lips
I heard the warning sounds Too fixd a gaze
 Awhile my vision labord as when late
Upon the oerstrained eyes the sun hath smote
But soon to lesser object as the view
Was now recoverd lesser in respect
To that excess of sensible whence late
I had perforce been sunderd on their right
I markd that glorious army wheel and turn
Against the sun and sevnfold lights their front
As when their bucklers for protection raisd
A wellrangd troop with portly banners curld
Wheel circling ere the whole can change their ground
Een thus the goodly regiment of heavn
Proceeding all did pass us ere the car
Had slopd his beam Attendant at the wheels
The damsels turnd and on the Gryphon movd
The sacred burden with a pace so smooth
No feather on him trembled The fair dame
Who through the wave had drawn me companied
By Statius and myself pursued the wheel
Whose orbit rolling markd a lesser arch
 Through the high wood now void the more her blame
Who by the serpent was beguild I past
With step in cadence to the harmony
Angelic Onward had we movd as far
Perchance as arrow at three several flights
Full wingd had sped when from her station down
Descended Beatrice With one voice
All murmurd Adam circling next a plant
Despoild of flowers and leaf on every bough
Its tresses spreading more as more they rose
Were such as midst their forest wilds for height
The Indians might have gazd at Blessed thou
Gryphon whose beak hath never pluckd that tree
Pleasant to taste for hence the appetite
Was warpd to evil Round the stately trunk
Thus shouted forth the rest to whom returnd
The animal twicegenderd Yea for so
The generation of the just are savd
And turning to the chariotpole to foot
He drew it of the widowd branch and bound
There left unto the stock whereon it grew
 As when large floods of radiance from above
Stream with that radiance mingled which ascends
Next after setting of the scaly sign
Our plants then burgeon and each wears anew
His wonted colours ere the sun have yokd
Beneath another star his flamy steeds
Thus putting forth a hue more faint than rose
And deeper than the violet was renewd
The plant erewhile in all its branches bare
 Unearthly was the hymn which then arose
I understood it not nor to the end
Endurd the harmony Had I the skill
To pencil forth how closd th unpitying eyes
Slumbring when Syrinx warbled eyes that paid
So dearly for their watching then like painter
That with a model paints I might design
The manner of my falling into sleep
But feign who will the slumber cunningly
I pass it by to when I wakd and tell
How suddenly a flash of splendour rent
The curtain of my sleep and one cries out
Arise what dost thou As the chosen three
On Tabors mount admitted to behold
The blossoming of that fair tree whose fruit
Is coveted of angels and doth make
Perpetual feast in heaven to themselves
Returning at the word whence deeper sleeps
Were broken that they their tribe diminishd saw
Both Moses and Elias gone and changd
The stole their master wore thus to myself
Returning over me beheld I stand
The piteous one who cross the stream had brought
My steps And where all doubting I exclaimd
Is BeatriceSee her she replied
Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root
Behold th associate choir that circles her
The others with a melody more sweet
And more profound journeying to higher realms
Upon the Gryphon tend If there her words
Were closd I know not but mine eyes had now
Taen view of her by whom all other thoughts
Were barrd admittance On the very ground
Alone she sat as she had there been left
A guard upon the wain which I beheld
Bound to the twyform beast The seven nymphs
Did make themselves a cloister round about her
And in their hands upheld those lights secure
From blast septentrion and the gusty south
 A little while thou shalt be forester here
And citizen shalt be forever with me
Of that true Rome wherein Christ dwells a Roman
To profit the misguided world keep now
Thine eyes upon the car and what thou seest
Take heed thou write returning to that place
 Thus Beatrice at whose feet inclind
Devout at her behest my thought and eyes
I as she bade directed Never fire
With so swift motion forth a stormy cloud
Leapd downward from the welkins farthest bound
As I beheld the bird of Jove descending
Pounce on the tree and as he rushd the rind
Disparting crush beneath him buds much more
And leaflets On the car with all his might
He struck whence staggering like a ship it reeld
At random drivn to starboard now oercome
And now to larboard by the vaulting waves
 Next springing up into the chariots womb
A fox I saw with hunger seeming pind
Of all good food But for his ugly sins
The saintly maid rebuking him away
Scampring he turnd fast as his hidebound corpse
Would bear him Next from whence before he came
I saw the eagle dart into the hull
O th car and leave it with his feathers lind
And then a voice like that which issues forth
From heart with sorrow rivd did issue forth
From heavn and O poor bark of mine it cried
How badly art thou freighted Then it seemd
That the earth opend between either wheel
And I beheld a dragon issue thence
That through the chariot fixd his forked train
And like a wasp that draggeth back the sting
So drawing forth his baleful train he draggd
Part of the bottom forth and went his way
Exulting What remaind as lively turf
With green herb so did clothe itself with plumes
Which haply had with purpose chaste and kind
Been offerd and therewith were clothd the wheels
Both one and other and the beam so quickly
A sigh were not breathd sooner Thus transformd
The holy structure through its several parts
Did put forth heads three on the beam and one
On every side the first like oxen hornd
But with a single horn upon their front
The four Like monster sight hath never seen
Oer it methought there sat secure as rock
On mountains lofty top a shameless whore
Whose ken rovd loosely round her At her side
As t were that none might bear her off I saw
A giant stand and ever and anon
They mingled kisses But her lustful eyes
Chancing on me to wander that fell minion
Scourgd her from head to foot all oer then full
Of jealousy and fierce with rage unloosd
The monster and draggd on so far across
The forest that from me its shades alone
Shielded the harlot and the newformd brute



CANTO XXXIII

The heathen Lord are come responsive thus
The trinal now and now the virgin band
Quaternion their sweet psalmody began
Weeping and Beatrice listend sad
And sighing to the song in such a mood
That Mary as she stood beside the cross
Was scarce more changd But when they gave her place
To speak then risen upright on her feet
She with a colour glowing bright as fire
Did answer Yet a little while and ye
Shall see me not and my beloved sisters
Again a little while and ye shall see me
 Before her then she marshalld all the seven
And beckning only motiond me the dame
And that remaining sage to follow her
 So on she passd and had not set I ween
Her tenth step to the ground when with mine eyes
Her eyes encounterd and with visage mild
So mend thy pace she cried that if my words
Address thee thou mayst still be aptly placd
To hear them Soon as duly to her side
I now had hastend Brother she began
Why makst thou no attempt at questioning
As thus we walk together Like to those
Who speaking with too reverent an awe
Before their betters draw not forth the voice
Alive unto their lips befell me shell
That I in sounds imperfect thus began
Lady what I have need of that thou knowst
And what will suit my need She answering thus
Of fearfulness and shame I will that thou
Henceforth do rid thee that thou speak no more
As one who dreams Thus far be taught of me
The vessel which thou sawst the serpent break
Was and is not let him who hath the blame
Hope not to scare Gods vengeance with a sop
Without an heir for ever shall not be
That eagle he who left the chariot plumd
Which monster made it first and next a prey
Plainly I view and therefore speak the stars
Een now approaching whose conjunction free
From all impediment and bar brings on
A season in the which one sent from God
Five hundred five and ten do mark him out
That foul one and th accomplice of her guilt
The giant both shall slay And if perchance
My saying dark as Themis or as Sphinx
Fail to persuade thee since like them it foils
The intellect with blindness yet ere long
Events shall be the Naiads that will solve
This knotty riddle and no damage light
On flock or field Take heed and as these words
By me are utterd teach them even so
To those who live that life which is a race
To death and when thou writst them keep in mind
Not to conceal how thou hast seen the plant
That twice hath now been spoild This whoso robs
This whoso plucks with blasphemy of deed
Sins against God who for his use alone
Creating hallowd it For taste of this
In pain and in desire five thousand years
And upward the first soul did yearn for him
Who punishd in himself the fatal gust
 Thy reason slumbers if it deem this height
And summit thus inverted of the plant
Without due cause and were not vainer thoughts
As Elsas numbing waters to thy soul
And their fond pleasures had not dyed it dark
As Pyramus the mulberry thou hadst seen
In such momentous circumstance alone
Gods equal justice morally implied
In the forbidden tree But since I mark thee
In understanding hardend into stone
And to that hardness spotted too and staind
So that thine eye is dazzled at my word
I will that if not written yet at least
Painted thou take it in thee for the cause
That one brings home his staff inwreathd with palm
 I thus As wax by seal that changeth not
Its impress now is stampd my brain by thee
But wherefore soars thy wishdfor speech so high
Beyond my sight that loses it the more
The more it strains to reach it To the end
That thou mayst know she answerd straight the school
That thou hast followd and how far behind
When following my discourse its learning halts
And mayst behold your art from the divine
As distant as the disagreement is
Twixt earth and heavens most high and rapturous orb
 I not remember I replied that eer
I was estrangd from thee nor for such fault
Doth conscience chide me Smiling she returnd
If thou canst not remember call to mind
How lately thou hast drunk of Lethes wave
And sure as smoke doth indicate a flame
In that forgetfulness itself conclude
Blame from thy alienated will incurrd
From henceforth verily my words shall be
As naked as will suit them to appear
In thy unpractisd view More sparkling now
And with retarded course the sun possessd
The circle of midday that varies still
As th aspect varies of each several clime
When as one sent in vaward of a troop
For escort pauses if perchance he spy
Vestige of somewhat strange and rare so pausd
The sevnfold band arriving at the verge
Of a dun umbrage hoar such as is seen
Beneath green leaves and gloomy branches oft
To overbrow a bleak and alpine cliff
And where they stood before them as it seemd
Tigris and Euphrates both beheld
Forth from one fountain issue and like friends
Linger at parting O enlightning beam
O glory of our kind beseech thee say
What water this which from one source derivd
Itself removes to distance from itself
 To such entreaty answer thus was made
Entreat Matilda that she teach thee this
 And here as one who clears himself of blame
Imputed the fair dame returnd Of me
He this and more hath learnt and I am safe
That Lethes water hath not hid it from him
 And Beatrice Some more pressing care
That oft the memory reeves perchance hath made
His minds eye dark But lo where Eunoe cows
Lead thither and as thou art wont revive
His fainting virtue As a courteous spirit
That proffers no excuses but as soon
As he hath token of anothers will
Makes it his own when she had taen me thus
The lovely maiden movd her on and calld
To Statius with an air most ladylike
Come thou with him Were further space allowd
Then Reader might I sing though but in part
That beverage with whose sweetness I had neer
Been sated But since all the leaves are full
Appointed for this second strain mine art
With warning bridle checks me I returnd
From the most holy wave regenerate
If en as new plants renewd with foliage new
Pure and made apt for mounting to the stars

CANTO IV

v 1 When It must be owned the beginning of this Canto is
somewhat obscure Bellutello refers for an elucidation of it to
the reasoning of Statius in the twentyfifth canto Perhaps some
illustration may be derived from the following passage in
Souths Sermons in which I have ventured to supply the words
between crotchets that seemed to be wanting to complete
the sense Now whether these three judgement memory and
invention are three distinct things both in being distinguished
from one another and likewise from the substance of the soul
itself considered without any such faculties or whether the
soul be one individual substance but only receiving these
several denominations rom the several respects arising from the
several actions exerted immediately by itself upon several
objects or several qualities of the same object I say whether
of these it is is not easy to decide and it is well that it is
not necessary Aquinas and most with him affirm the former and
Scotus with his followers the latter Vol iv Serm 1

skill in jurisprudence who having condemned to death Turrino da
Turrita brother of Ghino di Tacco for his robberies in Maremma
was murdered by Ghino in an apartment of his own house in the
presence of many witnesses Ghino was not only suffered to escape
in safety but as the commentators inform us obtained so high a
reputation by the liberality with which he was accustomed to
dispense the fruits of his plunder and treated those who fell
into his hands with so much courtesy that he was afterwards
invited to Rome and knighted by Boniface VIII A story is told

was surpassed either in military renown and prowess or in the
loftiness of his understanding G Villani 1 vii c 94

suppose Alonzo III King of Arragon the eldest son of Peter III

means Elinand a monk and chronicler in the reign of Philip
Augustus and Polycrato of England by whom is meant John of
Salisbury author of the Polycraticus de Curialium Nugis in the
twelfth century The passage in the text I find to be
nearly a translation from that work 1 v c 8 The original
appears to be in Dio Cassius where it is told of the Emperor
Hadrian lib I xix GREEK HERE

was born at Florence of a noble family in 1240 and died in
1300 The passage in the text is an illusion to his epitaph

Credidit ut Cimabos picturae castra tenere
Sic tenuit vivens nunc tenet astra poli

v 95 The cry is Giottos In Giotto we have a proof at how
early a period the fine arts were encouraged in Italy His
talents were discovered by Cimabue while he was tending sheep
for his father in the neighbourhood of Florence and he was
afterwards patronized by Pope Benedict XI and Robert King of
Naples and enjoyed the society and friendship of Dante whose
likeness he has transmitted to posterity He died in 1336 at
the age of 60

v 96 One Guido from the other Guido Cavalcanti the friend
of our Poet see Hell Canto X 59 had eclipsed the literary
fame of Guido Guinicelli of a noble family in Bologna whom we

Guinicelli died in 1276 Many of Cavalcantis writings hitherto
in MS are now publishing at Florence Esprit des Journaux Jan

probability that Dante here augurs the greatness of his own
poetical reputation Others have fancied that he prophesies the

the sake of one of his friends who was detained in captivity by

CANTO XVII

v 21 The bird that most Delights itself in song
I cannot think with Vellutello that the swallow is here meant
Dante probably alludes to the story of Philomela as it is found
in Homers Odyssey b xix 518 rather than as later poets have
told it She intended to slay the son of her husbands brother
Amphion incited to it by the envy of his wife who had six
children while herself had only two but through mistake slew
her own son Itylus and for her punishment was transformed by
Jupiter into a nightingale
Cowpers note on the passage
In speaking of the nightingale let me observe that while some
have considered its song as a melancholy and others as a
cheerful one Chiabrera appears to have come nearest the truth
when he says in the Alcippo a l s 1
Non mal si stanca d iterar le note

former leaves to the latter to discover for itself the three
carnal sins avarice gluttony and libidinousness having already
declared the nature of the spiritual sins pride envy anger
and indifference or lukewarmness in piety which the Italians
call accidia from the Greek word

Eudes King of France in 888

v 52 All save one The posterity of Charlemagne the second
race of French monarchs had failed with the exception of
Charles of Lorraine who is said on account of the melancholy
temper of his mind to have always clothed himself in black

Landino has Potti and he is probably right for Poitou was
annexed to the French crown by Philip IV See Henault Abrege
Chron AD l283 c Normandy had been united to it long before
by Philip Augustus a circumstance of which it is difficult to
imagine that Dante should have been ignorant but Philip IV says
Henault ibid took the title of King of Navarre and the
subjugation of Navarre is also alluded to in the

exhibits a curious instance of the changeableness of his

In those days says the commentator no less than in ours the
Florentine ladies exposed the neck and bosom a dress no doubt
more suitable to a harlot than a matron But as
they changed soon after insomuch that they wore collars up to
the chin covering the whole of the neck and throat so have I
hopes they will change again not indeed so much from motives of

v 20 Buonaggiunta Buonaggiunta Urbiciani of Lucca
There is a canzone by this poet printed in the collection made
by the Giunti p 209land a sonnet to Guido Guinicelli in
that made by Corbinelli p 169 from which we collect that he
lived not about 1230 as Quadrio supposes t ii p 159 but
towards the end of the thirteenth century Concerning other
poems by Buonaggiunta that are preserved in MS in some
libraries Crescimbeni may be consulted Tiraboschi Mr

edit vol i p 137 Crescimbeni 1 i Della Volg Poes p
72 4to ed 1698 gives an extract from one of his poems
printed in Allaccis Collection to show that the whimsical
compositions called Ariette  are not of modern
invention

v 56 Guittone Fra Guittone of Arezzo holds a
distinguished place in Italian literature as besides his poems
printed in the collection of the Giunti he has left a collection
of letters forty in number which afford the earliest specimen
of that kind of writing in the language They were
published at Rome in 1743 with learned illustrations by Giovanni
Bottari He was also the first who gave to the sonnet its
regular and legitimate form a species of composition in which
not only his own countrymen but many of the best poets in all
the cultivated languages of modern Europe have since so much
delighted

Guittone a native of Arezzo was the son of Viva di Michele
He was of the order of the  Frati Godenti of which an account
may be seen in the Notes to Hell Canto XXIII In the year 1293
he founded a monastery of the order of Camaldoli in Florence
and died in the following year Tiraboschi Ibid p 119
Dante in the Treatise de Vulg Eloq 1 i c 13 and 1 ii c

Averroes is said to be here meant Venturi refers to his
commentary on Aristotle De Anim 1 iii c 5 for the opinion
that there is only one universal intellect or mind pervading
every individual of the human race Much of the knowledge
displayed by our Poet in the present Canto appears to have been
derived from the medical work o Averroes called the Colliget

Matthiass ed v ii p 36 have considered this an

v 87 lycurgus Statius Theb 1 iv and v Hypsipile had
left her infant charge the son of Lycurgus on a bank where it
was destroyed by a serpent when she went to show the Argive army
the river of Langia and on her escaping the effects of
Lycurguss resentment the joy her own children felt at the sight
of her was such as our Poet felt on beholding his
predecessor Guinicelli

The incidents are beautifully described in Statius and seem to
have made an impression on Dante for he again Canto XXII 110
characterizes Hypsipile as her
Who showd Langias wave

v 111 He The united testimony of Dante and of Petrarch
in his Triumph of Love e iv places Arnault Daniel at the head
of the Provencal poets That he was born of poor but noble
parents at the castle of Ribeyrae in Perigord and that he was
at the English court is the amount of Millots information
concerning him t ii p 479

The account there given of his writings is not much more
satisfactory and the criticism on them must go for little better
than nothing

It is to be regretted that we have not an opportunity of judging
for ourselves of his love ditties and his tales of prose 

Versi damore e prose di romanzi

Our Poet frequently cities him in the work De Vulgari Eloquentia
According to Crescimbeni Della Volg Poes 1 1 p 7 ed
1698 He died in 1189

v 113 The songster of Limoges Giraud de Borneil of
Sideuil a castle in Limoges He was a troubadour much admired
and caressed in his day and appears to have been in favour with
the monarchs of Castile Leon Navarre and Arragon He is quoted
by Dante De Vulg Eloq and many of his poems are still
remaining in MS According to Nostradamus he died in 1278

that there is some error in this date and that he did not live

v 132 Thy courtesy Arnault is here made to speak in his own
tongue the Provencal According to Dante De Vulg Eloq 1 1
c 8 the Provencal was one language with the Spanish What he
says on this subject is so curious that the reader will perhaps
not be displeased it I give an abstract of it

He first makes three great divisions of the European languages
One of these extends from the mouths of the Danube or the lake
of Maeotis to the western limits of England and is bounded by
the limits of the French and Italians and by the ocean One
idiom obtained over the whole of this space but was
afterwards subdivided into the Sclavonian Hungarian Teutonic
Saxon English and the vernacular tongues of several other
people one sign remaining to all that they use the affirmative
io our English ay The whole of Europe beginning from the
Hungarian limits and stretching towards the east has a second
idiom which reaches still further than the end of Europe into
Asia This is the Greek In all that remains of Europe there is
a third idiom subdivided into three dialects which may be
severally distinguished by the use of the affirmatives oc oil
and si the first spoken by the Spaniards the next by the
French and the third by the Latins or Italians The first
occupy the western part of southern Europe beginning from the
limits of the Genoese The third occupy the eastern part
from the said limits as far that is as the promontory of
Italy where the Adriatic sea begins and to Sicily The second
are in a manner northern with respect to these for they have the
Germans to the east and north on the west they are bounded by
the English sea and the mountains of Arragon and on the
south by the people of Provence and the declivity of the
Apennine Ibid c x Each of these three he observes has
its own claims to distinction The excellency of the French
language consists in its being best adapted on account of its
facility and agreeableness to prose narration quicquid
redactum sive inventum est ad vulgare prosaicum suum
est and he instances the books compiled on the gests of the
Trojans and Romans and the delightful adventures of King Arthur
with many other histories and works of instruction The Spanish
or Provencal may boast of its having produced such
as first cultivated in this as in a more perfect and sweet
language the vernacular poetry among whom are Pierre
dAuvergne and others more ancient
The privileges of the Latin or Italian are two first that it
may reckon for its own those writers who have adopted a more
sweet and subtle style of poetry in the number of whom are Cino
da Pistoia and his friend and the next that its writers seem to
adhere to certain general rules of grammar and in so doing give
it in the opinion of the intelligent a very weighty pretension
to preference

mistake by a corruption in the text of Ovids Metam I vii

Carmina Naiades non intellecta priorum

instead of Carmina Laiades c as it has been since corrected

v 78 That one brings home his staff inwreathd with palm
For the same cause that the pilgrim returning from Palestine
brings home his staff or bourdon bound with palm that is to
show where he has been

Che si reca I bordon di palma cinto

In regard to the word bourdon why it has been applied to a
pilgrims staff it is not easy to guess I believe however
that this name has been given to such sort of staves because
pilgrims usually travel and perform their pilgrimages on foot
their staves serving them instead of horses or mules then called
bourdons and burdones by writers in the middle ages

PARADISE



CANTO I

His glory by whose might all things are movd
Pierces the universe and in one part
Sheds more resplendence elsewhere less In heavn
That largeliest of his light partakes was I
Witness of things which to relate again
Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence
For that so near approaching its desire
Our intellect is to such depth absorbd
That memory cannot follow Nathless all
That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm
Could store shall now be matter of my song
 Benign Apollo this last labour aid
And make me such a vessel of thy worth
As thy own laurel claims of me belovd
Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus brows
Sufficd me henceforth there is need of both
For my remaining enterprise Do thou
Enter into my bosom and there breathe
So as when Marsyas by thy hand was draggd
Forth from his limbs unsheathd O power divine
If thou to me of shine impart so much
That of that happy realm the shadowd form
Tracd in my thoughts I may set forth to view
Thou shalt behold me of thy favourd tree
Come to the foot and crown myself with leaves
For to that honour thou and my high theme
Will fit me If but seldom mighty Sire
To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath
Caesar or bard more shame for human wills
Depravd joy to the Delphic god must spring
From the Pierian foliage when one breast
Is with such thirst inspird From a small spark
Great flame hath risen after me perchance
Others with better voice may pray and gain
From the Cirrhaean city answer kind
 Through diver passages the worlds bright lamp
Rises to mortals but through that which joins
Four circles with the threefold cross in best
Course and in happiest constellation set
He comes and to the worldly wax best gives
Its temper and impression Morning there
Here eve was by almost such passage made
And whiteness had oerspread that hemisphere
Blackness the other part when to the left
I saw Beatrice turnd and on the sun
Gazing as never eagle fixd his ken
As from the first a second beam is wont
To issue and reflected upwards rise
Een as a pilgrim bent on his return
So of her act that through the eyesight passd
Into my fancy mine was formd and straight
Beyond our mortal wont I fixd mine eyes
Upon the sun Much is allowed us there
That here exceeds our powr thanks to the place
Made for the dwelling of the human kind
 I sufferd it not long and yet so long
That I beheld it bickring sparks around
As iron that comes boiling from the fire
And suddenly upon the day appeard
A day newrisn as he who hath the power
Had with another sun bedeckd the sky
 Her eyes fast fixd on the eternal wheels
Beatrice stood unmovd and I with ken
Fixd upon her from upward gaze removd
At her aspect such inwardly became
As Glaucus when he tasted of the herb
That made him peer among the ocean gods
Words may not tell of that transhuman change
And therefore let the example serve though weak
For those whom grace hath better proof in store
 If I were only what thou didst create
Then newly Love by whom the heavn is ruld
Thou knowst who by thy light didst bear me up
Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide
Desired Spirit with its harmony
Temperd of thee and measurd charmd mine ear
Then seemd to me so much of heavn to blaze
With the suns flame that rain or flood neer made
A lake so broad The newness of the sound
And that great light inflamd me with desire
Keener than eer was felt to know their cause
 Whence she who saw me clearly as myself
To calm my troubled mind before I askd
Opend her lips and gracious thus began
With false imagination thou thyself
Makst dull so that thou seest not the thing
Which thou hadst seen had that been shaken off
Thou art not on the earth as thou believst
For lightning scapd from its own proper place
Neer ran as thou hast hither now returnd
 Although divested of my firstraisd doubt
By those brief words accompanied with smiles
Yet in new doubt was I entangled more
And said Already satisfied I rest
From admiration deep but now admire
How I above those lighter bodies rise
 Whence after uttrance of a piteous sigh
She towrds me bent her eyes with such a look
As on her frenzied child a mother casts
Then thus began Among themselves all things
Have order and from hence the form which makes
The universe resemble God In this
The higher creatures see the printed steps
Of that eternal worth which is the end
Whither the line is drawn All natures lean
In this their order diversely some more
Some less approaching to their primal source
Thus they to different havens are movd on
Through the vast sea of being and each one
With instinct givn that bears it in its course
This to the lunar sphere directs the fire
This prompts the hearts of mortal animals
This the brute earth together knits and binds
Nor only creatures void of intellect
Are aimd at by this bow hut even those
That have intelligence and love are piercd
That Providence who so well orders all
With her own light makes ever calm the heaven
In which the substance that hath greatest speed
Is turnd and thither now as to our seat
Predestind we are carried by the force
Of that strong cord that never looses dart
But at fair aim and glad Yet is it true
That as ofttimes but ill accords the form
To the design of art through sluggishness
Of unreplying matter so this course
Is sometimes quitted by the creature who
Hath power directed thus to bend elsewhere
As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall
From its original impulse warpd to earth
By vicious fondness Thou no more admire
Thy soaring if I rightly deem than lapse
Of torrent downwards from a mountains height
There would in thee for wonder be more cause
If free of hindrance thou hadst fixd thyself
Below like fire unmoving on the earth
 So said she turnd toward the heavn her face



CANTO II

All ye who in small bark have following saild
Eager to listen on the adventrous track
Of my proud keel that singing cuts its way
Backward return with speed and your own shores
Revisit nor put out to open sea
Where losing me perchance ye may remain
Bewilderd in deep maze The way I pass
Neer yet was run Minerva breathes the gale
Apollo guides me and another Nine
To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal
Ye other few who have outstretchd the neck
Timely for food of angels on which here
They live yet never know satiety
Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out
Your vessel marking well the furrow broad
Before you in the wave that on both sides
Equal returns Those glorious who passd oer
To Colchos wonderd not as ye will do
When they saw Jason following the plough
 The increate perpetual thirst that draws
Toward the realm of Gods own form bore us
Swift almost as the heaven ye behold
 Beatrice upward gazd and I on her
And in such space as on the notch a dart
Is placd then loosend flies I saw myself
Arrivd where wondrous thing engagd my sight
Whence she to whom no work of mine was hid
Turning to me with aspect glad as fair
Bespake me Gratefully direct thy mind
To God through whom to this first star we come
 Me seemd as if a cloud had coverd us
Translucent solid firm and polishd bright
Like adamant which the suns beam had smit
Within itself the everduring pearl
Receivd us as the wave a ray of light
Receives and rests unbroken If I then
Was of corporeal frame and it transcend
Our weaker thought how one dimension thus
Another could endure which needs must be
If body enter body how much more
Must the desire inflame us to behold
That essence which discovers by what means
God and our nature joind There will be seen
That which we hold through faith not shown by proof
But in itself intelligibly plain
Een as the truth that man at first believes
 I answered Lady I with thoughts devout
Such as I best can frame give thanks to Him
Who hath removd me from the mortal world
But tell I pray thee whence the gloomy spots
Upon this body which below on earth
Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint
 She somewhat smild then spake If mortals err
In their opinion when the key of sense
Unlocks not surely wonders weapon keen
Ought not to pierce thee since thou findst the wings
Of reason to pursue the senses flight
Are short But what thy own thought is declare
 Then I What various here above appears
Is causd I deem by bodies dense or rare
 She then resumd Thou certainly wilt see
In falsehood thy belief oerwhelmd if well
Thou listen to the arguments which I
Shall bring to face it The eighth sphere displays
Numberless lights the which in kind and size
May be remarkd of different aspects
If rare or dense of that were cause alone
One single virtue then would be in all
Alike distributed or more or less
Different virtues needs must be the fruits
Of formal principles and these save one
Will by thy reasoning be destroyd Beside
If rarity were of that dusk the cause
Which thou inquirest either in some part
That planet must throughout be void nor fed
With its own matter or as bodies share
Their fat and leanness in like manner this
Must in its volume change the leaves The first
If it were true had through the suns eclipse
Been manifested by transparency
Of light as through aught rare beside effusd
But this is not Therefore remains to see
The other cause and if the other fall
Erroneous so must prove what seemd to thee
If not from side to side this rarity
Pass through there needs must be a limit whence
Its contrary no further lets it pass
And hence the beam that from without proceeds
Must be pourd back as colour comes through glass
Reflected which behind it lead conceals
Now wilt thou say that there of murkier hue
Than in the other part the ray is shown
By being thence refracted farther back
From this perplexity will free thee soon
Experience if thereof thou trial make
The fountain whence your arts derive their streame
Three mirrors shalt thou take and two remove
From thee alike and more remote the third
Betwixt the former pair shall meet thine eyes
Then turnd toward them cause behind thy back
A light to stand that on the three shall shine
And thus reflected come to thee from all
Though that beheld most distant do not stretch
A space so ample yet in brightness thou
Will own it equaling the rest But now
As under snow the ground if the warm ray
Smites it remains dismantled of the hue
And cold that coverd it before so thee
Dismantled in thy mind I will inform
With light so lively that the tremulous beam
Shall quiver where it falls Within the heaven
Where peace divine inhabits circles round
A body in whose virtue dies the being
Of all that it contains The following heaven
That hath so many lights this being divides
Through different essences from it distinct
And yet containd within it The other orbs
Their separate distinctions variously
Dispose for their own seed and produce apt
Thus do these organs of the world proceed
As thou beholdest now from step to step
Their influences from above deriving
And thence transmitting downwards Mark me well
How through this passage to the truth I ford
The truth thou lovst that thou henceforth alone
Mayst know to keep the shallows safe untold
 The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs
As mallet by the workmans hand must needs
By blessed movers be inspird This heaven
Made beauteous by so many luminaries
From the deep spirit that moves its circling sphere
Its image takes an impress as a seal
And as the soul that dwells within your dust
Through members different yet together formd
In different powrs resolves itself een so
The intellectual efficacy unfolds
Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars
On its own unity revolving still
Different virtue compact different
Makes with the precious body it enlivens
With which it knits as life in you is knit
From its original nature full of joy
The virtue mingled through the body shines
As joy through pupil of the living eye
From hence proceeds that which from light to light
Seems different and not from dense or rare
This is the formal cause that generates
Proportiond to its power the dusk or clear


CANTO III

That sun which erst with love my bosom warmd
Had of fair truth unveild the sweet aspect
By proof of right and of the false reproof
And I to own myself convincd and free
Of doubt as much as needed raisd my head
Erect for speech But soon a sight appeard
Which so intent to mark it held me fixd
That of confession I no longer thought
 As through translucent and smooth glass or wave
Clear and unmovd and flowing not so deep
As that its bed is dark the shape returns
So faint of our impicturd lineaments
That on white forehead set a pearl as strong
Comes to the eye such saw I many a face
All stretchd to speak from whence I straight conceivd
Delusion opposite to that which raisd
Between the man and fountain amorous flame
 Sudden as I perceivd them deeming these
Reflected semblances to see of whom
They were I turnd mine eyes and nothing saw
Then turnd them back directed on the light
Of my sweet guide who smiling shot forth beams
From her celestial eyes Wonder not thou
She cryd at this my smiling when I see
Thy childish judgment since not yet on truth
It rests the foot but as it still is wont
Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy
True substances are these which thou beholdst
Hither through failure of their vow exild
But speak thou with them listen and believe
That the true light which fills them with desire
Permits not from its beams their feet to stray
 Straight to the shadow which for converse seemd
Most earnest I addressed me and began
As one by overeagerness perplexd
O spirit born for joy who in the rays
Of life eternal of that sweetness knowst
The flavour which not tasted passes far
All apprehension me it well would please
If thou wouldst tell me of thy name and this
Your station here Whence she with kindness prompt
And eyes glistning with smiles Our charity
To any wish by justice introducd
Bars not the door no more than she above
Who would have all her court be like herself
I was a virgin sister in the earth
And if thy mind observe me well this form
With such addition gracd of loveliness
Will not conceal me long but thou wilt know
Piccarda in the tardiest sphere thus placd
Here mid these other blessed also blest
Our hearts whose high affections burn alone
With pleasure from the Holy Spirit conceivd
Admitted to his order dwell in joy
And this condition which appears so low
Is for this cause assignd us that our vows
Were in some part neglected and made void
 Whence I to her replied Something divine
Beams in your countenance wondrous fair
From former knowledge quite transmuting you
Therefore to recollect was I so slow
But what thou sayst hath to my memory
Given now such aid that to retrace your forms
Is easier Yet inform me ye who here
Are happy long ye for a higher place
More to behold and more in love to dwell
 She with those other spirits gently smild
Then answerd with such gladness that she seemd
With loves first flame to glow Brother our will
Is in composure settled by the power
Of charity who makes us will alone
What we possess and nought beyond desire
If we should wish to be exalted more
Then must our wishes jar with the high will
Of him who sets us here which in these orbs
Thou wilt confess not possible if here
To be in charity must needs befall
And if her nature well thou contemplate
Rather it is inherent in this state
Of blessedness to keep ourselves within
The divine will by which our wills with his
Are one So that as we from step to step
Are placd throughout this kingdom pleases all
Een as our King who in us plants his will
And in his will is our tranquillity
It is the mighty ocean whither tends
Whatever it creates and nature makes
 Then saw I clearly how each spot in heavn
Is Paradise though with like gracious dew
The supreme virtue showr not over all
 But as it chances if one sort of food
Hath satiated and of another still
The appetite remains that this is askd
And thanks for that returnd een so did I
In word and motion bent from her to learn
What web it was through which she had not drawn
The shuttle to its point She thus began
Exalted worth and perfectness of life
The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven
By whose pure laws upon your nether earth
The robe and veil they wear to that intent
That een till death they may keep watch or sleep
With their great bridegroom who accepts each vow
Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms
from the world to follow her when young
Escapd and in her vesture mantling me
Made promise of the way her sect enjoins
Thereafter men for ill than good more apt
Forth snatchd me from the pleasant cloisters pale
God knows how after that my life was framd
This other splendid shape which thou beholdst
At my right side burning with all the light
Of this our orb what of myself I tell
May to herself apply From her like me
A sister with like violence were torn
The saintly folds that shaded her fair brows
Een when she to the world again was brought
In spite of her own will and better wont
Yet not for that the bosoms inward veil
Did she renounce This is the luminary
Of mighty Constance who from that loud blast
Which blew the second over Suabias realm
That power producd which was the third and last
 She ceasd from further talk and then began
Ave Maria singing and with that song
Vanishd as heavy substance through deep wave
 Mine eye that far as it was capable
Pursued her when in dimness she was lost
Turnd to the mark where greater want impelld
And bent on Beatrice all its gaze
But she as lightning beamd upon my looks
So that the sight sustaind it not at first
Whence I to question her became less prompt



CANTO IV

Between two kinds of food both equally
Remote and tempting first a man might die
Of hunger ere he one could freely choose
Een so would stand a lamb between the maw
Of two fierce wolves in dread of both alike
Een so between two deer a dog would stand
Wherefore if I was silent fault nor praise
I to myself impute by equal doubts
Held in suspense since of necessity
It happend Silent was I yet desire
Was painted in my looks and thus I spake
My wish more earnestly than language could
 As Daniel when the haughty king he freed
From ire that spurrd him on to deeds unjust
And violent so lookd Beatrice then
 Well I discern she thus her words addressd
How contrary desires each way constrain thee
So that thy anxious thought is in itself
Bound up and stifled nor breathes freely forth
Thou arguest if the good intent remain
What reason that anothers violence
Should stint the measure of my fair desert
 Cause too thou findst for doubt in that it seems
That spirits to the stars as Plato deemd
Return These are the questions which thy will
Urge equally and therefore I the first
Of that will treat which hath the more of gall
Of seraphim he who is most enskyd
Moses and Samuel and either John
Choose which thou wilt nor even Marys self
Have not in any other heavn their seats
Than have those spirits which so late thou sawst
Nor more or fewer years exist but all
Make the first circle beauteous diversely
Partaking of sweet life as more or less
Afflation of eternal bliss pervades them
Here were they shown thee not that fate assigns
This for their sphere but for a sign to thee
Of that celestial furthest from the height
Thus needs that ye may apprehend we speak
Since from things sensible alone ye learn
That which digested rightly after turns
To intellectual For no other cause
The scripture condescending graciously
To your perception hands and feet to God
Attributes nor so means and holy church
Doth represent with human countenance
Gabriel and Michael and him who made
Tobias whole Unlike what here thou seest
The judgment of Timaeus who affirms
Each soul restord to its particular star
Believing it to have been taken thence
When nature gave it to inform her mold
Since to appearance his intention is
Een what his words declare or else to shun
Derision haply thus he hath disguisd
His true opinion If his meaning be
That to the influencing of these orbs revert
The honour and the blame in human acts
Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth
This principle not understood aright
Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world
So that it fell to fabled names of Jove
And Mercury and Mars That other doubt
Which moves thee is less harmful for it brings
No peril of removing thee from me
 That to the eye of man our justice seems
Unjust is argument for faith and not
For heretic declension To the end
This truth may stand more clearly in your view
I will content thee even to thy wish
 If violence be when that which suffers nought
Consents to that which forceth not for this
These spirits stood exculpate For the will
That will not still survives unquenchd and doth
As nature doth in fire tho violence
Wrest it a thousand times for if it yield
Or more or less so far it follows force
And thus did these whom they had power to seek
The hallowd place again In them had will
Been perfect such as once upon the bars
Held Laurence firm or wrought in Scaevola
To his own hand remorseless to the path
Whence they were drawn their steps had hastend back
When liberty returnd but in too few
Resolve so steadfast dwells And by these words
If duly weighd that argument is void
Which oft might have perplexd thee still But now
Another question thwarts thee which to solve
Might try thy patience without better aid
I have no doubt instilld into thy mind
That blessed spirit may not lie since near
The source of primal truth it dwells for aye
And thou mightst after of Piccarda learn
That Constance held affection to the veil
So that she seems to contradict me here
Not seldom brother it hath chancd for men
To do what they had gladly left undone
Yet to shun peril they have done amiss
Een as Alcmaeon at his fathers suit
Slew his own mother so made pitiless
Not to lose pity On this point bethink thee
That force and will are blended in such wise
As not to make the offence excusable
Absolute will agrees not to the wrong
That inasmuch as there is fear of woe
From noncompliance it agrees Of will
Thus absolute Piccarda spake and I
Of th other so that both have truly said
 Such was the flow of that pure rill that welld
From forth the fountain of all truth and such
The rest that to my wondring thoughts l found
 O thou of primal love the prime delight
Goddess I straight replyd whose lively words
Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul
Affection fails me to requite thy grace
With equal sum of gratitude be his
To recompense who sees and can reward thee
Well I discern that by that truth alone
Enlightend beyond which no truth may roam
Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know
Therein she resteth een as in his lair
The wild beast soon as she hath reachd that bound
And she hath power to reach it else desire
Were given to no end And thence doth doubt
Spring like a shoot around the stock of truth
And it is nature which from height to height
On to the summit prompts us This invites
This doth assure me lady revrently
To ask thee of other truth that yet
Is dark to me I fain would know if man
By other works well done may so supply
The failure of his vows that in your scale
They lack not weight I spake and on me straight
Beatrice lookd with eyes that shot forth sparks
Of love celestial in such copious stream
That virtue sinking in me overpowerd
I turnd and downward bent confusd my sight



CANTO V

If beyond earthly wont the flame of love
Illume me so that I oercome thy power
Of vision marvel not but learn the cause
In that perfection of the sight which soon
As apprehending hasteneth on to reach
The good it apprehends I well discern
How in thine intellect already shines
The light eternal which to view alone
Neer fails to kindle love and if aught else
Your love seduces t is but that it shows
Some illmarkd vestige of that primal beam
 This wouldst thou know if failure of the vow
By other service may be so supplied
As from selfquestion to assure the soul
 Thus she her words not heedless of my wish
Began and thus as one who breaks not off
Discourse continued in her saintly strain
Supreme of gifts which God creating gave
Of his free bounty sign most evident
Of goodness and in his account most prizd
Was liberty of will the boon wherewith
All intellectual creatures and them sole
He hath endowd Hence now thou mayst infer
Of what high worth the vow which so is framd
That when man offers God wellpleasd accepts
For in the compact between God and him
This treasure such as I describe it to thee
He makes the victim and of his own act
What compensation therefore may he find
If that whereof thou hast oblation made
By using well thou thinkst to consecrate
Thou wouldst of theft do charitable deed
Thus I resolve thee of the greater point
 But forasmuch as holy church herein
Dispensing seems to contradict the truth
I have discoverd to thee yet behooves
Thou rest a little longer at the board
Ere the crude aliment which thou hast taken
Digested fitly to nutrition turn
Open thy mind to what I now unfold
And give it inward keeping Knowledge comes
Of learning well retaind unfruitful else
 This sacrifice in essence of two things
Consisteth one is that whereof t is made
The covenant the other For the last
It neer is cancelld if not kept and hence
I spake erewhile so strictly of its force
For this it was enjoind the Israelites
Though leave were givn them as thou knowst to change
The offering still to offer Th other part
The matter and the substance of the vow
May well be such to that without offence
It may for other substance be exchangd
But at his own discretion none may shift
The burden on his shoulders unreleasd
By either key the yellow and the white
Nor deem of any change as less than vain
If the last bond be not within the new
Included as the quatre in the six
No satisfaction therefore can be paid
For what so precious in the balance weighs
That all in counterpoise must kick the beam
Take then no vow at random taen with faith
Preserve it yet not bent as Jephthah once
Blindly to execute a rash resolve
Whom better it had suited to exclaim
1 have done ill than to redeem his pledge
By doing worse or not unlike to him
In folly that great leader of the Greeks
Whence on the alter Iphigenia mournd
Her virgin beauty and hath since made mourn
Both wise and simple even all who hear
Of so fell sacrifice Be ye more staid
O Christians not like feather by each wind
Removable nor think to cleanse ourselves
In every water Either testament
The old and new is yours and for your guide
The shepherd of the church let this suffice
To save you When by evil lust enticd
Remember ye be men not senseless beasts
Nor let the Jew who dwelleth in your streets
Hold you in mockry Be not as the lamb
That fickle wanton leaves its mothers milk
To dally with itself in idle play
 Such were the words that Beatrice spake
These ended to that region where the world
Is liveliest full of fond desire she turnd
 Though mainly prompt new question to propose
Her silence and changd look did keep me dumb
And as the arrow ere the cord is still
Leapeth unto its mark so on we sped
Into the second realm There I beheld
The dame so joyous enter that the orb
Grew brighter at her smiles and if the star
Were movd to gladness what then was my cheer
Whom nature hath made apt for every change
 As in a quiet and clear lake the fish
If aught approach them from without do draw
Towards it deeming it their food so drew
Full more than thousand splendours towards us
And in each one was heard Lo one arrivd
To multiply our loves and as each came
The shadow streaming forth effulgence new
Witnessd augmented joy Here reader think
If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale
To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave
And thou shalt see what vehement desire
Possessd me as soon as these had met my view
To know their state O born in happy hour
Thou to whom grace vouchsafes or ere thy close
Of fleshly warfare to behold the thrones
Of that eternal triumph know to us
The light communicated which through heaven
Expatiates without bound Therefore if aught
Thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid
Spare not and of our radiance take thy fill
 Thus of those piteous spirits one bespake me
And Beatrice next Say on and trust
As unto gods How in the light supreme
Thou harbourst and from thence the virtue bringst
That sparkling in thine eyes denotes thy joy
l mark but who thou art am still to seek
Or wherefore worthy spirit for thy lot
This sphere assignd that oft from mortal ken
Is veild by others beams I said and turnd
Toward the lustre that with greeting kind
Erewhile had haild me Forthwith brighter far
Than erst it waxd and as himself the sun
Hides through excess of light when his warm gaze
Hath on the mantle of thick vapours preyd
Within its proper ray the saintly shape
Was through increase of gladness thus conceald
And shrouded so in splendour answerd me
Een as the tenour of my song declares



CANTO VI

After that Constantine the eagle turnd
Against the motions of the heavn that rolld
Consenting with its course when he of yore
Lavinias spouse was leader of the flight
A hundred years twice told and more his seat
At Europes extreme point the bird of Jove
Held near the mountains whence he issued first
There under shadow of his sacred plumes
Swaying the world till through successive hands
To mine he came devolvd Caesar I was
And am Justinian destind by the will
Of that prime love whose influence I feel
From vain excess to clear th encumberd laws
Or ere that work engagd me I did hold
Christs nature merely human with such faith
Contented But the blessed Agapete
Who was chief shepherd he with warning voice
To the true faith recalld me I believd
His words and what he taught now plainly see
As thou in every contradiction seest
The true and false opposd Soon as my feet
Were to the church reclaimd to my great task
By inspiration of Gods grace impelld
I gave me wholly and consignd mine arms
To Belisarius with whom heavens right hand
Was linkd in such conjointment t was a sign
That I should rest To thy first question thus
I shape mine answer which were ended here
But that its tendency doth prompt perforce
To some addition that thou well mayst mark
What reason on each side they have to plead
By whom that holiest banner is withstood
Both who pretend its power and who oppose
 Beginning from that hour when Pallas died
To give it rule behold the valorous deeds
Have made it worthy reverence Not unknown
To thee how for three hundred years and more
It dwelt in Alba up to those fell lists
Where for its sake were met the rival three
Nor aught unknown to thee which it achievd
Down to the Sabines wrong to Lucrece woe
With its sevn kings conquring the nation round
Nor all it wrought by Roman worthies home
Gainst Brennus and th Epirot prince and hosts
Of single chiefs or states in league combind
Of social warfare hence Torquatus stern
And Quintius namd of his neglected locks
The Decii and the Fabii hence acquird
Their fame which I with duteous zeal embalm
By it the pride of Arab hordes was quelld
When they led on by Hannibal oerpassd
The Alpine rocks whence glide thy currents Po
Beneath its guidance in their prime of days
Scipio and Pompey triumphd and that hill
Under whose summit thou didst see the light
Rued its stern bearing After near the hour
When heavn was minded that oer all the world
His own deep calm should brood to Caesars hand
Did Rome consign it and what then it wrought
From Var unto the Rhine saw Iseres flood
Saw Loire and Seine and every vale that fills
The torrent Rhone What after that it wrought
When from Ravenna it came forth and leapd
The Rubicon was of so bold a flight
That tongue nor pen may follow it Towrds Spain
It wheeld its bands then towrd Dyrrachium smote
And on Pharsalia with so fierce a plunge
Een the warm Nile was conscious to the pang
Its native shores Antandros and the streams
Of Simois revisited and there
Where Hector lies then ill for Ptolemy
His pennons shook again lightning thence fell
On Juba and the next upon your west
At sound of the Pompeian trump returnd
 What following and in its next bearers gripe
It wrought is now by Cassius and Brutus
Barkd off in hell and by Perugias sons
And Modenas was mournd Hence weepeth still
Sad Cleopatra who pursued by it
Took from the adder black and sudden death
With him it ran een to the Red Sea coast
With him composd the world to such a peace
That of his temple Janus barrd the door
 But all the mighty standard yet had wrought
And was appointed to perform thereafter
Throughout the mortal kingdom which it swayd
Falls in appearance dwindled and obscurd
If one with steady eye and perfect thought
On the third Caesar look for to his hands
The living Justice in whose breath I move
Committed glory een into his hands
To execute the vengeance of its wrath
 Hear now and wonder at what next I tell
After with Titus it was sent to wreak
Vengeance for vengeance of the ancient sin
And when the Lombard tooth with fangs impure
Did gore the bosom of the holy church
Under its wings victorious Charlemagne
Sped to her rescue Judge then for thyself
Of those whom I erewhile accusd to thee
What they are and how grievous their offending
Who are the cause of all your ills The one
Against the universal ensign rears
The yellow lilies and with partial aim
That to himself the other arrogates
So that t is hard to see which more offends
Be yours ye Ghibellines to veil your arts
Beneath another standard ill is this
Followd of him who severs it and justice
And let not with his Guelphs the newcrownd Charles
Assail it but those talons hold in dread
Which from a lion of more lofty port
Have rent the easing Many a time ere now
The sons have for the sires transgression waild
Nor let him trust the fond belief that heavn
Will truck its armour for his lilied shield
 This little star is furnishd with good spirits
Whose mortal lives were busied to that end
That honour and renown might wait on them
And when desires thus err in their intention
True love must needs ascend with slacker beam
But it is part of our delight to measure
Our wages with the merit and admire
The close proportion Hence doth heavnly justice
Temper so evenly affection in us
It neer can warp to any wrongfulness
Of diverse voices is sweet music made
So in our life the different degrees
Render sweet harmony among these wheels
 Within the pearl that now encloseth us
Shines Romeos light whose goodly deed and fair
Met ill acceptance But the Provencals
That were his foes have little cause for mirth
Ill shapes that man his course who makes his wrong
Of others worth Four daughters were there born
To Raymond Berenger and every one
Became a queen and this for him did Romeo
Though of mean state and from a foreign land
Yet envious tongues incited him to ask
A reckoning of that just one who returnd
Twelve fold to him for ten Aged and poor
He parted thence and if the world did know
The heart he had begging his life by morsels
T would deem the praise it yields him scantly dealt



CANTO VII

Hosanna Sanctus Deus Sabaoth
Superillustrans claritate tua
Felices ignes horum malahoth
Thus chanting saw I turn that substance bright
With fourfold lustre to its orb again
Revolving and the rest unto their dance
With it movd also and like swiftest sparks
In sudden distance from my sight were veild
 Me doubt possessd and Speak it whisperd me
Speak speak unto thy lady that she quench
Thy thirst with drops of sweetness Yet blank awe
Which lords it oer me even at the sound
Of Beatrices name did bow me down
As one in slumber held Not long that mood
Beatrice sufferd she with such a smile
As might have made one blest amid the flames
Beaming upon me thus her words began
Thou in thy thought art pondring as I deem
And what I deem is truth how just revenge
Could be with justice punishd from which doubt
I soon will free thee so thou mark my words
For they of weighty matter shall possess thee
 That man who was unborn himself condemnd
And in himself all who since him have livd
His offspring whence below the human kind
Lay sick in grievous error many an age
Until it pleasd the Word of God to come
Amongst them down to his own person joining
The nature from its Maker far estrangd
By the mere act of his eternal love
Contemplate here the wonder I unfold
The nature with its Maker thus conjoind
Created first was blameless pure and good
But through itself alone was driven forth
From Paradise because it had eschewd
The way of truth and life to evil turnd
Neer then was penalty so just as that
Inflicted by the cross if thou regard
The nature in assumption doomd neer wrong
So great in reference to him who took
Such nature on him and endurd the doom
God therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased
So different effects flowd from one act
And heavn was opend though the earth did quake
Count it not hard henceforth when thou dost hear
That a just vengeance was by righteous court
Justly revengd But yet I see thy mind
By thought on thought arising sore perplexd
And with how vehement desire it asks
Solution of the maze What I have heard
Is plain thou sayst but wherefore God this way
For our redemption chose eludes my search
 Brother no eye of man not perfected
Nor fully ripend in the flame of love
May fathom this decree It is a mark
In sooth much aimd at and but little kennd
And I will therefore show thee why such way
Was worthiest The celestial love that spume
All envying in its bounty in itself
With such effulgence blazeth as sends forth
All beauteous things eternal What distils
Immediate thence no end of being knows
Bearing its seal immutably impressd
Whatever thence immediate falls is free
Free wholly uncontrollable by power
Of each thing new by such conformity
More grateful to its author whose bright beams
Though all partake their shining yet in those
Are liveliest which resemble him the most
These tokens of preeminence on man
Largely bestowd if any of them fail
He needs must forfeit his nobility
No longer stainless Sin alone is that
Which doth disfranchise him and make unlike
To the chief good for that its light in him
Is darkend And to dignity thus lost
Is no return unless where guilt makes void
He for ill pleasure pay with equal pain
Your nature which entirely in its seed
Trangressd from these distinctions fell no less
Than from its state in Paradise nor means
Found of recovery search all methods out
As strickly as thou may save one of these
The only fords were left through which to wade
Either that God had of his courtesy
Releasd him merely or else man himself
For his own folly by himself atond
 Fix now thine eye intently as thou canst
On th everlasting counsel and explore
Instructed by my words the dread abyss
 Man in himself had ever lackd the means
Of satisfaction for he could not stoop
Obeying in humility so low
As high he disobeying thought to soar
And for this reason he had vainly tried
Out of his own sufficiency to pay
The rigid satisfaction Then behooved
That God should by his own ways lead him back
Unto the life from whence he fell restord
By both his ways I mean or one alone
But since the deed is ever prizd the more
The more the doers good intent appears
Goodness celestial whose broad signature
Is on the universe of all its ways
To raise ye up was fain to leave out none
Nor aught so vast or so magnificent
Either for him who gave or who receivd
Between the last night and the primal day
Was or can be For God more bounty showd
Giving himself to make man capable
Of his return to life than had the terms
Been mere and unconditional release
And for his justice every method else
Were all too scant had not the Son of God
Humbled himself to put on mortal flesh
 Now to fulfil each wish of thine remains
I somewhat further to thy view unfold
That thou mayst see as clearly as myself
 I see thou sayst the air the fire I see
The earth and water and all things of them
Compounded to corruption turn and soon
Dissolve Yet these were also things create
Because if what were told me had been true
They from corruption had been therefore free
 The angels O my brother and this clime
Wherein thou art impassible and pure
I call created as indeed they are
In their whole being But the elements
Which thou hast namd and what of them is made
Are by created virtue informd create
Their substance and create the informing virtue
In these bright stars that round them circling move
The soul of every brute and of each plant
The ray and motion of the sacred lights
With complex potency attract and turn
But this our life the eternal good inspires
Immediate and enamours of itself
So that our wishes rest for ever here
 And hence thou mayst by inference conclude
Our resurrection certain if thy mind
Consider how the human flesh was framd
When both our parents at the first were made



CANTO VIII

The world was in its day of peril dark
Wont to believe the dotage of fond love
From the fair Cyprian deity who rolls
In her third epicycle shed on men
By stream of potent radiance therefore they
Of elder time in their old error blind
Not her alone with sacrifice adord
And invocation but like honours paid
To Cupid and Dione deemd of them
Her mother and her son him whom they feignd
To sit in Didos bosom and from her
Whom I have sung preluding borrowd they
The appellation of that star which views
Now obvious and now averse the sun
 I was not ware that I was wafted up
Into its orb but the new loveliness
That gracd my lady gave me ample proof
That we had entered there And as in flame
A sparkle is distinct or voice in voice
Discernd when one its even tenour keeps
The other comes and goes so in that light
I other luminaries saw that coursd
In circling motion rapid more or less
As their eternal phases each impels
 Never was blast from vapour charged with cold
Whether invisible to eye or no
Descended with such speed it had not seemd
To linger in dull tardiness compard
To those celestial lights that towrds us came
Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring
Conducted by the lofty seraphim
And after them who in the van appeard
Such an hosanna sounded as hath left
Desire neer since extinct in me to hear
Renewd the strain Then parting from the rest
One near us drew and sole began We all
Are ready at thy pleasure well disposd
To do thee gentle service We are they
To whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing
O ye whose intellectual ministry
Moves the third heaven and in one orb we roll
One motion one impulse with those who rule
Princedoms in heaven yet are of love so full
That to please thee t will be as sweet to rest
 After mine eyes had with meek reverence
Sought the celestial guide and were by her
Assurd they turnd again unto the light
Who had so largely promisd and with voice
That bare the lively pressure of my zeal
Tell who ye are I cried Forthwith it grew
In size and splendour through augmented joy
And thus it answerd A short date below
The world possessd me Had the time been more
Much evil that will come had never chancd
My gladness hides thee from me which doth shine 
Around and shroud me as an animal
In its own silk enswathd Thou lovdst me well
And hadst good cause for had my sojourning
Been longer on the earth the love I bare thee
Had put forth more than blossoms The left bank
That Rhone when he hath mixd with Sorga laves
In me its lord expected and that horn
Of fair Ausonia with its boroughs old
Bari and Croton and Gaeta pild
From where the Trento disembogues his waves
With Verde mingled to the salt seaflood
Already on my temples beamd the crown
Which gave me sovreignty over the land
By Danube washd whenas he strays beyond
The limits of his German shores The realm
Where on the gulf by stormy Eurus lashd
Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights
The beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom
Not through Typhaeus but the vapry cloud
Bituminous upsteamd THAT too did look
To have its scepter wielded by a race
Of monarchs sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph
had not ill lording which doth spirit up
The people ever in Palermo raisd
The shout of death reechod loud and long
Had but my brothers foresight kennd as much
He had been warier that the greedy want
Of Catalonia might not work his bale
And truly need there is that he forecast
Or other for him lest more freight be laid
On his already overladen bark
Nature in him from bounty falln to thrift
Would ask the guard of braver arms than such
As only care to have their coffers filld
 My liege it doth enhance the joy thy words
Infuse into me mighty as it is
To think my gladness manifest to thee
As to myself who own it when thou lookst
Into the source and limit of all good
There where thou markest that which thou dost speak
Thence prizd of me the more Glad thou hast made me
Now make intelligent clearing the doubt
Thy speech hath raised in me for much I muse
How bitter can spring up when sweet is sown
 I thus inquiring he forthwith replied
If I have power to show one truth soon that
Shall face thee which thy questioning declares
Behind thee now conceald The Good that guides
And blessed makes this realm which thou dost mount
Ordains its providence to be the virtue
In these great bodies nor th all perfect Mind
Upholds their nature merely but in them
Their energy to save for nought that lies
Within the range of that unerring bow
But is as level with the destind aim
As ever mark to arrows point opposd
Were it not thus these heavens thou dost visit
Would their effect so work it would not be
Art but destruction and this may not chance
If th intellectual powers that move these stars
Fail not or who first faulty made them fail
Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidencd
 To whom I thus It is enough no fear
I see lest nature in her part should tire
 He straight rejoind Say were it worse for man
If he livd not in fellowship on earth
 Yea answerd I nor here a reason needs
 And may that be if different estates
Grow not of different duties in your life
Consult your teacher and he tells you no
 Thus did he come deducing to this point
And then concluded For this cause behooves
The roots from whence your operations come
Must differ Therefore one is Solon born
Another Xerxes and Melchisidec
A third and he a fourth whose airy voyage
Cost him his son In her circuitous course
Nature that is the seal to mortal wax
Doth well her art but no distinctions owns
Twixt one or other household Hence befalls
That Esau is so wide of Jacob hence
Quirinus of so base a father springs
He dates from Mars his lineage Were it not
That providence celestial overruld
Nature in generation must the path
Tracd by the generator still pursue
Unswervingly Thus place I in thy sight
That which was late behind thee But in sign
Of more affection for thee t is my will
Thou wear this corollary Nature ever
Finding discordant fortune like all seed
Out of its proper climate thrives but ill
And were the world below content to mark
And work on the foundation nature lays
It would not lack supply of excellence
But ye perversely to religion strain
Him who was born to gird on him the sword
And of the fluent phrasemen make your king
Therefore your steps have wanderd from the paths



CANTO IX

After solution of my doubt thy Charles
O fair Clemenza of the treachery spake
That must befall his seed but Tell it not
Said he and let the destind years come round
Nor may I tell thee more save that the meed
Of sorrow welldeservd shall quit your wrongs
 And now the visage of that saintly light
Was to the sun that fills it turnd again
As to the good whose plenitude of bliss
Sufficeth all O ye misguided souls
Infatuate who from such a good estrange
Your hearts and bend your gaze on vanity
Alas for youAnd lo toward me next
Another of those splendent forms approachd
That by its outward brightning testified
The will it had to pleasure me The eyes
Of Beatrice resting as before
Firmly upon me manifested forth
Approva1 of my wish And O I cried
Blest spirit quickly be my will performd
And prove thou to me that my inmost thoughts
I can reflect on thee Thereat the light
That yet was new to me from the recess
Where it before was singing thus began
As one who joys in kindness In that part
Of the depravd Italian land which lies
Between Rialto and the fountainsprings
Of Brenta and of Piava there doth rise
But to no lofty eminence a hill
From whence erewhile a firebrand did descend
That sorely sheet the region From one root
I and it sprang my name on earth Cunizza
And here I glitter for that by its light
This star oercame me Yet I naught repine
Nor grudge myself the cause of this my lot
Which haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive
 This jewel that is next me in our heaven
Lustrous and costly great renown hath left
And not to perish ere these hundred years
Five times absolve their round Consider thou
If to excel be worthy mans endeavour
When such life may attend the first Yet they
Care not for this the crowd that now are girt
By Adice and Tagliamento still
Impenitent tho scourgd The hour is near
When for their stubbornness at Paduas marsh
The water shall be changd that laves Vicena
And where Cagnano meets with Sile one
Lords it and bears his head aloft for whom
The web is now awarping Feltro too
Shall sorrow for its godless shepherds fault
Of so deep stain that never for the like
Was Maltas bar unclosd Too large should be
The skillet that would hold Ferraras blood
And wearied he who ounce by ounce would weight it
The which this priest in show of partyzeal
Courteous will give nor will the gift ill suit
The countrys custom We descry above
Mirrors ye call them thrones from which to us
Reflected shine the judgments of our God
Whence these our sayings we avouch for good
 She ended and appeard on other thoughts
Intent reentring on the wheel she late
Had left That other joyance meanwhile waxd
A thing to marvel at in splendour glowing
Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun
For in that upper clime effulgence comes
Of gladness as here laughter and below
As the mind saddens murkier grows the shade
 God seeth all and in him is thy sight
Said I blest Spirit Therefore will of his
Cannot to thee be dark Why then delays
Thy voice to satisfy my wish untold
That voice which joins the inexpressive song
Pastime of heavn the which those ardours sing
That cowl them with six shadowing wings outspread
I would not wait thy asking wert thou known
To me as thoroughly I to thee am known
 He forthwith answring thus his words began
The valley of waters widest next to that
Which doth the earth engarland shapes its course
Between discordant shores against the sun
Inward so far it makes meridian there
Where was before th horizon Of that vale
Dwelt I upon the shore twixt Ebros stream
And Macras that divides with passage brief
Genoan bounds from Tuscan East and west
Are nearly one to Begga and my land
Whose haven erst was with its own blood warm
Who knew my name were wont to call me Folco
And I did bear impression of this heavn
That now bears mine for not with fiercer flame
Glowd Belus daughter injuring alike
Sichaeus and Creusa than did I
Long as it suited the unripend down
That fledgd my cheek nor she of Rhodope
That was beguiled of Demophoon
Nor Joves son when the charms of Iole
Were shrind within his heart And yet there hides
No sorrowful repentance here but mirth
Not for the fault that doth not come to mind
But for the virtue whose oerruling sway
And providence have wrought thus quaintly Here
The skill is lookd into that fashioneth
With such effectual working and the good
Discernd accruing to this upper world
From that below But fully to content
Thy wishes all that in this sphere have birth
Demands my further parle Inquire thou wouldst
Who of this light is denizen that here
Beside me sparkles as the sunbeam doth
On the clear wave Know then the soul of Rahab
Is in that gladsome harbour to our tribe
United and the foremost rank assignd
He to that heavn at which the shadow ends
Of your sublunar world was taken up
First in Christs triumph of all souls redeemd
For well behoovd that in some part of heavn
She should remain a trophy to declare
The mighty contest won with either palm
For that she favourd first the high exploit
Of Joshua on the holy land whereof
The Pope recks little now Thy city plant
Of him that on his Maker turnd the back
And of whose envying so much woe hath sprung
Engenders and expands the cursed flower
That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs
Turning the shepherd to a wolf For this
The gospel and great teachers laid aside
The decretals as their stuft margins show
Are the sole study Pope and Cardinals
Intent on these neer journey but in thought
To Nazareth where Gabriel opd his wings
Yet it may chance erelong the Vatican
And other most selected parts of Rome
That were the grave of Peters soldiery
Shall be deliverd from the adultrous bond



CANTO X

Looking into his firstborn with the love
Which breathes from both eternal the first Might
Ineffable whence eye or mind
Can roam hath in such order all disposd
As none may see and fail to enjoy Raise then
O reader to the lofty wheels with me
Thy ken directed to the point whereat
One motion strikes on th other There begin
Thy wonder of the mighty Architect
Who loves his work so inwardly his eye
Doth ever watch it See how thence oblique
Brancheth the circle where the planets roll
To pour their wished influence on the world
Whose path not bending thus in heavn above
Much virtue would be lost and here on earth
All power well nigh extinct or from direct
Were its departure distant more or less
I th universal order great defect
Must both in heavn and here beneath ensue
 Now rest thee reader on thy bench and muse
Anticipative of the feast to come
So shall delight make thee not feel thy toil
Lo I have set before thee for thyself
Feed now the matter I indite henceforth
Demands entire my thought Joind with the part
Which late we told of the great minister
Of nature that upon the world imprints
The virtue of the heaven and doles out
Time for us with his beam went circling on
Along the spires where each hour sooner comes
And I was with him weetless of ascent
As one who till arrivd weets not his coming
 For Beatrice she who passeth on
So suddenly from good to better time
Counts not the act oh then how great must needs
Have been her brightness What she was i th sun
Where I had enterd not through change of hue
But light transparentdid I summon up
Genius art practiceI might not so speak
It should be eer imagind yet believd
It may be and the sight be justly cravd
And if our fantasy fail of such height
What marvel since no eye above the sun
Hath ever traveld Such are they dwell here
Fourth family of the Omnipotent Sire
Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows
And holds them still enrapturd with the view
And thus to me Beatrice Thank oh thank
The Sun of angels him who by his grace
To this perceptible hath lifted thee
 Never was heart in such devotion bound
And with complacency so absolute
Disposd to render up itself to God
As mine was at those words and so entire
The love for Him that held me it eclipsd
Beatrice in oblivion Naught displeasd
Was she but smild thereat so joyously
That of her laughing eyes the radiance brake
And scatterd my collected mind abroad
 Then saw I a bright band in liveliness
Surpassing who themselves did make the crown
And us their centre yet more sweet in voice
Than in their visage beaming Cincturd thus
Sometime Latonas daughter we behold
When the impregnate air retains the thread
That weaves her zone In the celestial court
Whence I return are many jewels found
So dear and beautiful they cannot brook
Transporting from that realm and of these lights
Such was the song Who doth not prune his wing
To soar up thither let him look from thence
For tidings from the dumb When singing thus
Those burning suns that circled round us thrice
As nearest stars around the fixed pole
Then seemd they like to ladies from the dance
Not ceasing but suspense in silent pause
Listning till they have caught the strain anew
Suspended so they stood and from within
Thus heard I one who spake Since with its beam
The grace whence true love lighteth first his flame
That after doth increase by loving shines
So multiplied in thee it leads thee up
Along this ladder down whose hallowd steps
None eer descend and mount them not again
Who from his phial should refuse thee wine
To slake thy thirst no less constrained were
Than water flowing not unto the sea
Thou fain wouldst hear what plants are these that bloom
In the bright garland which admiring girds
This fair dame round who strengthens thee for heavn
I then was of the lambs that Dominic
Leads for his saintly flock along the way
Where well they thrive not sworn with vanity
He nearest on my right hand brother was
And master to me Albert of Cologne
Is this and of Aquinum Thomas I
If thou of all the rest wouldst be assurd
Let thine eye waiting on the words I speak
In circuit journey round the blessed wreath
That next resplendence issues from the smile
Of Gratian who to either forum lent
Such help as favour wins in Paradise
The other nearest who adorns our quire
Was Peter he that with the widow gave
To holy church his treasure The fifth light
Goodliest of all is by such love inspired
That all your world craves tidings of its doom
Within there is the lofty light endowd
With sapience so profound if truth be truth
That with a ken of such wide amplitude
No second hath arisen Next behold
That tapers radiance to whose view was shown
Clearliest the nature and the ministry
Angelical while yet in flesh it dwelt
In the other little light serenely smiles
That pleader for the Christian temples he
Who did provide Augustin of his lore
Now if thy minds eye pass from light to light
Upon my praises following of the eighth
Thy thirst is next The saintly soul that shows
The worlds deceitfulness to all who hear him
Is with the sight of all the good that is
Blest there The limbs whence it was driven lie
Down in Cieldauro and from martyrdom
And exile came it here Lo further on
Where flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore
Of Bede and Richard more than man erewhile
In deep discernment Lastly this from whom
Thy look on me reverteth was the beam
Of one whose spirit on high musings bent
Rebukd the lingring tardiness of death
It is the eternal light of Sigebert
Who scapd not envy when of truth he argued
Reading in the strawlitterd street Forthwith
As clock that calleth up the spouse of God
To win her bridegrooms love at matins hour
Each part of other fitly drawn and urgd
Sends out a tinkling sound of note so sweet
Affection springs in welldisposed breast
Thus saw I move the glorious wheel thus heard
Voice answring voice so musical and soft
It can be known but where day endless shines



CANTO XI

O fond anxiety of mortal men
How vain and inconclusive arguments
Are those which make thee beat thy wings below
For statues one and one for aphorisms
Was hunting this the priesthood followd that
By force or sophistry aspird to rule
To rob another and another sought
By civil business wealth one moiling lay
Tangled in net of sensual delight
And one to witless indolence resignd
What time from all these empty things escapd
With Beatrice I thus gloriously
Was raisd aloft and made the guest of heavn
 They of the circle to that point each one
Where erst it was had turnd and steady glowd
As candle in his socket Then within
The lustre that erewhile bespake me smiling
With merer gladness heard I thus begin
 Een as his beam illumes me so I look
Into the eternal light and clearly mark
Thy thoughts from whence they rise Thou art in doubt
And wouldst that I should bolt my words afresh
In such plain open phrase as may be smooth
To thy perception where I told thee late
That well they thrive and that no second such
Hath risen which no small distinction needs
 The providence that governeth the world
In depth of counsel by created ken
Unfathomable to the end that she
Who with loud cries was spousd in precious blood
Might keep her footing towards her wellbelovd
Safe in herself and constant unto him
Hath two ordaind who should on either hand
In chief escort her one seraphic all
In fervency for wisdom upon earth
The other splendour of cherubic light
I but of one will tell he tells of both
Who one commendeth which of them soer
Be taken for their deeds were to one end
 Between Tupino and the wave that falls
From blest Ubaldos chosen hill there hangs
Rich slope of mountain high whence heat and cold
Are wafted through Perugias eastern gate
And Norcera with Gualdo in its rear
Mourn for their heavy yoke Upon that side
Where it doth break its steepness most arose
A sun upon the world as duly this
From Ganges doth therefore let none who speak
Of that place say Ascesi for its name
Were lamely so deliverd but the East
To call things rightly be it henceforth styld
He was not yet much distant from his rising
When his good influence gan to bless the earth
A dame to whom none openeth pleasures gate
More than to death was gainst his fathers will
His stripling choice and he did make her his
Before the Spiritual court by nuptial bonds
And in his fathers sight from day to day
Then lovd her more devoutly She bereavd
Of her first husband slighted and obscure
Thousand and hundred years and more remaind
Without a single suitor till he came
Nor aught availd that with Amyclas she
Was found unmovd at rumour of his voice
Who shook the world nor aught her constant boldness
Whereby with Christ she mounted on the cross
When Mary stayd beneath But not to deal
Thus closely with thee longer take at large
The rovers titlesPoverty and Francis
Their concord and glad looks wonder and love
And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts
So much that venerable Bernard first
Did bare his feet and in pursuit of peace
So heavenly ran yet deemd his footing slow
O hidden riches O prolific good
Egidius bares him next and next Sylvester
And follow both the bridegroom so the bride
Can please them Thenceforth goes he on his way
The father and the master with his spouse
And with that family whom now the cord
Girt humbly nor did abjectness of heart
Weigh down his eyelids for that he was son
Of Pietro Bernardone and by men
In wondrous sort despisd But royally
His hard intention he to Innocent
Set forth and from him first receivd the seal
On his religion Then when numerous flockd
The tribe of lowly ones that tracd HIS steps
Whose marvellous life deservedly were sung
In heights empyreal through Honorius hand
A second crown to deck their Guardians virtues
Was by the eternal Spirit inwreathd and when
He had through thirst of martyrdom stood up
In the proud Soldans presence and there preachd
Christ and his followers but found the race
Unripend for conversion back once more
He hasted not to intermit his toil
And reapd Ausonian lands On the hard rock
Twixt Arno and the Tyber he from Christ
Took the last Signet which his limbs two years
Did carry Then the season come that he
Who to such good had destind him was pleasd
T advance him to the meed which he had earnd
By his selfhumbling to his brotherhood
As their just heritage he gave in charge
His dearest lady and enjoind their love
And faith to her and from her bosom willd
His goodly spirit should move forth returning
To its appointed kingdom nor would have
His body laid upon another bier
 Think now of one who were a fit colleague
To keep the bark of Peter in deep sea
Helmd to right point and such our Patriarch was
Therefore who follow him as he enjoins
Thou mayst be certain take good lading in
But hunger of new viands tempts his flock
So that they needs into strange pastures wide
Must spread them and the more remote from him
The stragglers wander so much mole they come
Home to the sheepfold destitute of milk
There are of them in truth who fear their harm
And to the shepherd cleave but these so few
A little stuff may furnish out their cloaks
 Now if my words be clear if thou have taen
Good heed if that which I have told recall
To mind thy wish may be in part fulfilld
For thou wilt see the point from whence they split
Nor miss of the reproof which that implies
That well they thrive not sworn with vanity



CANTO XII

Soon as its final word the blessed flame
Had raisd for utterance straight the holy mill
Began to wheel nor yet had once revolvd
Or ere another circling compassd it
Motion to motion song to song conjoining
Song that as much our muses doth excel
Our Sirens with their tuneful pipes as ray
Of primal splendour doth its faint reflex
 As when if Juno bid her handmaid forth
Two arches parallel and trickd alike
Span the thin cloud the outer taking birth
From that within in manner of that voice
Whom love did melt away as sun the mist
And they who gaze presageful call to mind
The compact made with Noah of the world
No more to be oerflowd about us thus
Of sempiternal roses bending wreathd
Those garlands twain and to the innermost
Een thus th external answered When the footing
And other great festivity of song
And radiance light with light accordant each
Jocund and blythe had at their pleasure stilld
Een as the eyes by quick volition movd
Are shut and raisd together from the heart
Of one amongst the new lights movd a voice
That made me seem like needle to the star
In turning to its whereabout and thus
Began The love that makes me beautiful
Prompts me to tell of th other guide for whom
Such good of mine is spoken Where one is
The other worthily should also be
That as their warfare was alike alike
Should be their glory Slow and full of doubt
And with thin ranks after its banner movd
The army of Christ which it so clearly cost
To reappoint when its imperial Head
Who reigneth ever for the drooping host
Did make provision thorough grace alone
And not through its deserving As thou heardst
Two champions to the succour of his spouse
He sent who by their deeds and words might join
Again his scatterd people In that clime
Where springs the pleasant westwind to unfold
The fresh leaves with which Europe sees herself
Newgarmented nor from those billows far
Beyond whose chiding after weary course
The sun doth sometimes hide him safe abides
The happy Callaroga under guard
Of the great shield wherein the lion lies
Subjected and supreme And there was born
The loving million of the Christian faith
The hollowd wrestler gentle to his own
And to his enemies terrible So replete
His soul with lively virtue that when first
Created even in the mothers womb
It prophesied When at the sacred font
The spousals were complete twixt faith and him
Where pledge of mutual safety was exchangd
The dame who was his surety in her sleep
Beheld the wondrous fruit that was from him
And from his heirs to issue And that such
He might be construed as indeed he was
She was inspird to name him of his owner
Whose he was wholly and so calld him Dominic
And I speak of him as the labourer
Whom Christ in his own garden chose to be
His helpmate Messenger he seemd and friend
Fastknit to Christ and the first love he showd
Was after the first counsel that Christ gave
Many a time his nurse at entering found
That he had risn in silence and was prostrate
As who should say My errand was for this
O happy father Felix rightly namd
O favourd mother rightly namd Joanna
If that do mean as men interpret it
Not for the worlds sake for which now they pore
Upon Ostiense and Taddeos page
But for the real manna soon he grew
Mighty in learning and did set himself
To go about the vineyard that soon turns
To wan and witherd if not tended well
And from the see whose bounty to the just
And needy is gone by not through its fault
But his who fills it basely he besought
No dispensation for commuted wrong
Nor the first vacant fortune nor the tenth
That to Gods paupers rightly appertain
But gainst an erring and degenerate world
Licence to fight in favour of that seed
From which the twice twelve cions gird thee round
Then with sage doctrine and good will to help
Forth on his great apostleship he fard
Like torrent bursting from a lofty vein
And dashing gainst the stocks of heresy
Smote fiercest where resistance was most stout
Thence many rivulets have since been turnd
Over the garden Catholic to lead
Their living waters and have fed its plants
 If such one wheel of that twoyoked car
Wherein the holy church defended her
And rode triumphant through the civil broil
Thou canst not doubt its fellows excellence
Which Thomas ere my coming hath declard
So courteously unto thee But the track
Which its smooth fellies made is now deserted
That mouldy mother is where late were lees
His family that wont to trace his path
Turn backward and invert their steps erelong
To rue the gathering in of their ill crop
When the rejected tares in vain shall ask
Admittance to the barn I question not
But he who searchd our volume leaf by leaf
Might still find page with this inscription ont
I am as I was wont Yet such were not
From Acquasparta nor Casale whence
Of those who come to meddle with the text
One stretches and another cramps its rule
Bonaventuras life in me behold
From Bagnororegio one who in discharge
Of my great offices still laid aside
All sinister aim Illuminato here
And Agostino join me two they were
Among the first of those barefooted meek ones
Who sought Gods friendship in the cord with them
Hugues of Saint Victor Pietro Mangiadore
And he of Spain in his twelve volumes shining
Nathan the prophet Metropolitan
Chrysostom and Anselmo and who deignd
To put his hand to the first art Donatus
Raban is here and at my side there shines
Calabrias abbot Joachim  endowd
With soul prophetic The bright courtesy
Of friar Thomas and his goodly lore
Have movd me to the blazon of a peer
So worthy and with me have movd this throng



CANTO XIII

Let him who would conceive what now I saw
Imagine and retain the image firm
As mountain rock the whilst he hears me speak
Of stars fifteen from midst the ethereal host
Selected that with lively ray serene
Oercome the massiest air thereto imagine
The wain that in the bosom of our sky
Spins ever on its axle night and day
With the bright summit of that horn which swells
Due from the pole round which the first wheel rolls
T have rangd themselves in fashion of two signs
In heavn such as Ariadne made
When deaths chill seized her and that one of them
Did compass in the others beam and both
In such sort whirl around that each should tend
With opposite motion and conceiving thus
Of that true constellation and the dance
Twofold that circled me he shall attain
As t were the shadow for things there as much
Surpass our usage as the swiftest heavn
Is swifter than the Chiana There was sung
No Bacchus and no Io Paean but
Three Persons in the Godhead and in one
Substance that nature and the human joind
 The song fulfilld its measure and to us
Those saintly lights attended happier made
At each new ministring Then silence brake
Amid th accordant sons of Deity
That luminary in which the wondrous life
Of the meek man of God was told to me
And thus it spake One ear o th harvest threshd
And its grain safely stord sweet charity
Invites me with the other to like toil
 Thou knowst that in the bosom whence the rib
Was taen to fashion that fair cheek whose taste
All the world pays for and in that which piercd
By the keen lance both after and before
Such satisfaction offerd as outweighs
Each evil in the scale whateer of light
To human nature is allowd must all
Have by his virtue been infusd who formd
Both one and other and thou thence admirst
In that I told thee of beatitudes
A second there is none to his enclosd
In the fifth radiance Open now thine eyes
To what I answer thee and thou shalt see
Thy deeming and my saying meet in truth
As centre in the round That which dies not
And that which can die are but each the beam
Of that idea which our Soverign Sire
Engendereth loving for that lively light
Which passeth from his brightness not disjoind
From him nor from his love triune with them
Doth through his bounty congregate itself
Mirrord as t were in new existences
Itself unalterable and ever one
 Descending hence unto the lowest powers
Its energy so sinks at last it makes
But brief contingencies for so I name
Things generated which the heavnly orbs
Moving with seed or without seed produce
Their wax and that which molds it differ much
And thence with lustre more or less it shows
Th ideal stamp impress so that one tree
According to his kind hath better fruit
And worse and at your birth ye mortal men
Are in your talents various Were the wax
Molded with nice exactness and the heavn
In its disposing influence supreme
The lustre of the seal should be complete
But nature renders it imperfect ever
Resembling thus the artist in her work
Whose faultering hand is faithless to his skill
Howeer if love itself dispose and mark
The primal virtue kindling with bright view
There all perfection is vouchsafed and such
The clay was made accomplishd with each gift
That life can teem with such the burden filld
The virgins bosom so that I commend
Thy judgment that the human nature neer
Was or can be such as in them it was
 Did I advance no further than this point
How then had he no peer thou mightst reply
But that what now appears not may appear
Right plainly ponder who he was and what
When he was bidden Ask  the motive swayd
To his requesting I have spoken thus
That thou mayst see he was a king who askd
For wisdom to the end he might be king
Sufficient not the number to search out
Of the celestial movers or to know
If necessary with contingent eer
Have made necessity or whether that
Be granted that first motion is or if
Of the mid circle can by art be made
Triangle with each corner blunt or sharp
 Whence noting that which I have said and this
Thou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn
At which the dart of my intention aims
And marking clearly that I told thee Risen
Thou shalt discern it only hath respect
To kings of whom are many and the good
Are rare With this distinction take my words
And they may well consist with that which thou
Of the first human father dost believe
And of our wellbeloved And let this
Henceforth be led unto thy feet to make
Thee slow in motion as a weary man
Both to the yea and to the nay thou seest not
For he among the fools is down full low
Whose affirmation or denial is
Without distinction in each case alike
Since it befalls that in most instances
Current opinion leads to false and then
Affection bends the judgment to her ply
 Much more than vainly doth he loose from shore
Since he returns not such as he set forth
Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill
And open proofs of this unto the world
Have been afforded in Parmenides
Melissus Bryso and the crowd beside
Who journeyd on and knew not whither so did
Sabellius Arius and the other fools
Who like to scymitars reflected back
The scriptureimage by distortion marrd
 Let not the people be too swift to judge
As one who reckons on the blades in field
Or ere the crop be ripe For I have seen
The thorn frown rudely all the winter long
And after bear the rose upon its top
And bark that all the way across the sea
Ran straight and speedy perish at the last
Een in the havens mouth seeing one steal
Another brine his offering to the priest
Let not Dame Birtha and Sir Martin thence
Into heavns counsels deem that they can pry
For one of these may rise the other fall



CANTO XIV

From centre to the circle and so back
From circle to the centre water moves
In the round chalice even as the blow
Impels it inwardly or from without
Such was the image glancd into my mind
As the great spirit of Aquinum ceasd
And Beatrice after him her words
Resumd alternate Need there is tho yet
He tells it to you not in words nor een
In thought that he should fathom to its depth
Another mystery Tell him if the light
Wherewith your substance blooms shall stay with you
Eternally as now and if it doth
How when ye shall regain your visible forms
The sight may without harm endure the change
That also tell As those who in a ring
Tread the light measure in their fitful mirth
Raise loud the voice and spring with gladder bound
Thus at the hearing of that pious suit
The saintly circles in their tourneying
And wondrous note attested new delight
 Whoso laments that we must doff this garb
Of frail mortality thenceforth to live
Immortally above he hath not seen
The sweet refreshing of that heavnly shower
 Him who lives ever and for ever reigns
In mystic union of the Three in One
Unbounded bounding all each spirit thrice
Sang with such melody as but to hear
For highest merit were an ample meed
And from the lesser orb the goodliest light
With gentle voice and mild such as perhaps
The angels once to Mary thus replied
Long as the joy of Paradise shall last
Our love shall shine around that raiment bright
As fervent fervent as in vision blest
And that as far in blessedness exceeding
As it hath grave beyond its virtue great
Our shape regarmented with glorious weeds
Of saintly flesh must being thus entire
Show yet more gracious Therefore shall increase
Whateer of light gratuitous imparts
The Supreme Good light ministering aid
The better disclose his glory whence
The vision needs increasing much increase
The fervour which it kindles and that too
The ray that comes from it But as the greed
Which gives out flame yet it its whiteness shines
More lively than that and so preserves
Its proper semblance thus this circling sphere
Of splendour shall to view less radiant seem
Than shall our fleshly robe which yonder earth
Now covers Nor will such excess of light
Oerpower us in corporeal organs made
Firm and susceptible of all delight
 So ready and so cordial an Amen
Followed from either choir as plainly spoke
Desire of their dead bodies yet perchance
Not for themselves but for their kindred dear
Mothers and sires and those whom best they lovd
Ere they were made imperishable flame
 And lo forthwith there rose up round about
A lustre over that already there
Of equal clearness like the brightening up
Of the horizon As at an evening hour
Of twilight new appearances through heavn
Peer with faint glimmer doubtfully descried
So there new substances methought began
To rise in view and round the other twain
Enwheeling sweep their ampler circuit wide
 O gentle glitter of eternal beam
With what a such whiteness did it flow
Oerpowering vision in me But so fair
So passing lovely Beatrice showd
Mind cannot follow it nor words express
Her infinite sweetness Thence mine eyes regaind
Power to look up and I beheld myself
Sole with my lady to more lofty bliss
Translated for the star with warmer smile
Impurpled well denoted our ascent
 With all the heart and with that tongue which speaks
The same in all an holocaust I made
To God befitting the new grace vouchsafd
And from my bosom had not yet upsteamd
The fuming of that incense when I knew
The rite accepted With such mighty sheen
And mantling crimson in two listed rays
The splendours shot before me that I cried
God of Sabaoth that does prank them thus
 As leads the galaxy from pole to pole
Distinguishd into greater lights and less
Its pathway which the wisest fail to spell
So thickly studded in the depth of Mars
Those rays describd the venerable sign
That quadrants in the round conjoining frame
Here memory mocks the toil of genius Christ
Beamd on that cross and pattern fails me now
But whoso takes his cross and follows Christ
Will pardon me for that I leave untold
When in the fleckerd dawning he shall spy
The glitterance of Christ From horn to horn
And tween the summit and the base did move
Lights scintillating as they met and passd
Thus oft are seen with everchangeful glance
Straight or athwart now rapid and now slow
The atomies of bodies long or short
To move along the sunbeam whose slant line
Checkers the shadow interposd by art
Against the noontide heat And as the chime
Of minstrel music dulcimer and help
With many strings a pleasant dining makes
To him who heareth not distinct the note
So from the lights which there appeard to me
Gatherd along the cross a melody
That indistinctly heard with ravishment
Possessd me Yet I markd it was a hymn
Of lofty praises for there came to me
Arise and conquer as to one who hears
And comprehends not Me such ecstasy
Oercame that never till that hour was thing
That held me in so sweet imprisonment
 Perhaps my saying over bold appears
Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes
Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire
But he who is aware those living seals
Of every beauty work with quicker force
The higher they are risn and that there
I had not turnd me to them he may well
Excuse me that whereof in my excuse
I do accuse me and may own my truth
That holy pleasure here not yet reveald
Which grows in transport as we mount aloof



CANTO XV

True love that ever shows itself as clear
In kindness as loose appetite in wrong
Silenced that lyre harmonious and stilld
The sacred chords that are by heavns right hand
Unwound and tightend flow to righteous prayers
Should they not hearken who to give me will
For praying in accordance thus were mute
He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief
Who for the love of thing that lasteth not
Despoils himself forever of that love
 As oft along the still and pure serene
At nightfall glides a sudden trail of fire
Attracting with involuntary heed
The eye to follow it erewhile at rest
And seems some star that shifted place in heavn
Only that whence it kindles none is lost
And it is soon extinct thus from the horn
That on the dexter of the cross extends
Down to its foot one luminary ran
From mid the cluster shone there yet no gem
Droppd from its foil and through the beamy list
Like flame in alabaster glowd its course
 So forward stretchd him if of credence aught
Our greater muse may claim the pious ghost
Of old Anchises in the Elysian bower
When he perceivd his son O thou my blood
O most exceeding grace divine to whom
As now to thee hath twice the heavnly gate
Been eer unclosd so spake the light whence I
Turnd me toward him then unto my dame
My sight directed and on either side
Amazement waited me for in her eyes
Was lighted such a smile I thought that mine
Had divd unto the bottom of my grace
And of my bliss in Paradise Forthwith
To hearing and to sight grateful alike
The spirit to his proem added things
I understood not so profound he spake
Yet not of choice but through necessity
Mysterious for his high conception scard
Beyond the mark of mortals When the flight
Of holy transport had so spent its rage
That nearer to the level of our thought
The speech descended the first sounds I heard
Were Best he thou Triunal Deity
That hast such favour in my seed vouchsafd
Then followd No unpleasant thirst tho long
Which took me reading in the sacred book
Whose leaves or white or dusky never change
Thou hast allayd my son within this light
From whence my voice thou hearst more thanks to her
Who for such lofty mounting has with plumes
Begirt thee Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me
From him transmitted who is first of all
Een as all numbers ray from unity
And therefore dost not ask me who I am
Or why to thee more joyous I appear
Than any other in this gladsome throng
The truth is as thou deemst for in this hue
Both less and greater in that mirror look
In which thy thoughts or ere thou thinkst are shown
But that the love which keeps me wakeful ever
Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire
May be contended fully let thy voice
Fearless and frank and jocund utter forth
Thy will distinctly utter forth the wish
Whereto my ready answer stands decreed
 I turnd me to Beatrice and she heard
Ere I had spoken smiling an assent
That to my will gave wings and I began
To each among your tribe what time ye kennd
The nature in whom naught unequal dwells
Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt
For that they are so equal in the sun
From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat
As makes all likeness scant But will and means
In mortals for the cause ye well discern
With unlike wings are fledge A mortal I
Experience inequality like this
And therefore give no thanks but in the heart
For thy paternal greeting This howeer
I pray thee living topaz that ingemmst
This precious jewel let me hear thy name
 I am thy root O leaf whom to expect
Even hath pleasd me thus the prompt reply
Prefacing next it added he of whom
Thy kindred appellation comes and who
These hundred years and more on its first ledge
Hath circuited the mountain was my son
And thy great grandsire Well befits his long
Endurance should he shortend by thy deeds
 Florence within her ancient limitmark
Which calls her still to matin prayers and noon
Was chaste and sober and abode in peace
She had no armlets and no headtires then
No purfled dames no zone that caught the eye
More than the person did Time was not yet
When at his daughters birth the sire grew pale
For fear the age and dowry should exceed
On each side just proportion House was none
Void of its family nor yet had come
Hardanapalus to exhibit feats
Of chamber prowess Montemalo yet
Oer our suburban turret rose as much
To be surpass in fall as in its rising
I saw Bellincione Berti walk abroad
In leathern girdle and a clasp of bone
And with no artful colouring on her cheeks
His lady leave the glass The sons I saw
Of Nerli and of Vecchio well content
With unrobd jerkin and their good dames handling
The spindle and the flax O happy they
Each sure of burial in her native land
And none left desolate abed for France
One wakd to tend the cradle hushing it
With sounds that lulld the parents infancy
Another with her maidens drawing off
The tresses from the distaff lecturd them
Old tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome
A Salterello and Cianghella we
Had held as strange a marvel as ye would
A Cincinnatus or Cornelia now
 In such composd and seemly fellowship
Such faithful and such fair equality
In so sweet household Mary at my birth
Bestowd me calld on with loud cries and there
In your old baptistery I was made
Christian at once and Cacciaguida as were
My brethren Eliseo and Moronto
 From Valdipado came to me my spouse
And hence thy surname grew I followd then
The Emperor Conrad and his knighthood he
Did gird on me in such good part he took
My valiant service After him I went
To testify against that evil law
Whose people by the shepherds fault possess
Your right usurping There by that foul crew
Was I releasd from the deceitful world
Whose base affection many a spirit soils
And from the martyrdom came to this peace



CANTO XVI

O slight respect of mans nobility
I never shall account it marvelous
That our infirm affection here below
Thou movst to boasting when I could not choose
Een in that region of unwarpd desire
In heavn itself but make my vaunt in thee
Yet cloak thou art soon shortend for that time
Unless thou be eked out from day to day
Goes round thee with his shears Resuming then
With greeting such as Rome was first to bear
But since hath disaccustomd I began
And Beatrice that a little space
Was severd smild reminding me of her
Whose cough emboldend as the story holds
To first offence the doubting Guenever
 You are my sire said I you give me heart
Freely to speak my thought above myself
You raise me Through so many streams with joy
My soul is filld that gladness wells from it
So that it bears the mighty tide and bursts not
Say then my honourd stem what ancestors
Where those you sprang from and what years were markd
In your first childhood Tell me of the fold
That hath Saint John for guardian what was then
Its state and who in it were highest seated
 As embers at the breathing of the wind
Their flame enliven so that light I saw
Shine at my blandishments and as it grew
More fair to look on so with voice more sweet
Yet not in this our modern phrase forthwith
It answerd From the day when it was said
 Hail Virgin to the throes by which my mother
Who now is sainted lightend her of me
Whom she was heavy with this fire had come
Five hundred fifty times and thrice its beams
To reilumine underneath the foot
Of its own lion They of whom I sprang
And I had there our birthplace where the last
Partition of our city first is reachd
By him that runs her annual game Thus much
Suffice of my forefathers who they were
And whence they hither came more honourable
It is to pass in silence than to tell
All those who in that time were there from Mars
Until the Baptist fit to carry arms
Were but the fifth of them this day alive
But then the citizens blood that now is mixd
From Campi and Certaldo and Fighine
Ran purely through the last mechanics veins
O how much better were it that these people
Were neighbours to you and that at Galluzzo
And at Trespiano ye should have your boundry
Than to have them within and bear the stench
Of Agugliones hind and Signas him
That hath his eye already keen for bartring
Had not the people which of all the world
Degenerates most been stepdame unto Caesar
But as a mother gracious to her son
Such one as hath become a Florentine
And trades and traffics had been turnd adrift
To Simifonte where his grandsire plyd
The beggars craft The Conti were possessd
Of Montemurlo still the Cerchi still
Were in Acones parish nor had haply
From Valdigrieve past the Buondelmonte
The citys malady hath ever source
In the confusion of its persons as
The bodys in variety of food
And the blind bull falls with a steeper plunge
Than the blind lamb and oftentimes one sword
Doth more and better execution
Than five Mark Luni Urbisaglia mark
How they are gone and after them how go
Chiusi and Sinigaglia and t will seem
No longer new or strange to thee to hear
That families fail when cities have their end
All things that appertain t ye like yourselves
Are mortal but mortality in some
Ye mark not they endure so long and you
Pass by so suddenly And as the moon
Doth by the rolling of her heavnly sphere
Hide and reveal the strand unceasingly
So fortune deals with Florence Hence admire not
At what of them I tell thee whose renown
Time covers the first Florentines I saw
The Ughi Catilini and Filippi
The Alberichi Greci and Ormanni
Now in their wane illustrious citizens
And great as ancient of Sannella him
With him of Arca saw and Soldanieri
And Ardinghi and Bostichi At the poop
That now is laden with new felony
So cumbrous it may speedily sink the bark
The Ravignani sat of whom is sprung
The County Guido and whoso hath since
His title from the famd Bellincione taen
Fair governance was yet an art well prizd
By him of Pressa Galigaio showd
The gilded hilt and pommel in his house
The column clothd with verrey still was seen
Unshaken the Sacchetti still were great
Giouchi Sifanti Galli and Barucci
With them who blush to hear the bushel namd
Of the Calfucci still the branchy trunk
Was in its strength and to the curule chairs
Sizii and Arigucci yet were drawn
How mighty them I saw whom since their pride
Hath undone and in all her goodly deeds
Florence was by the bullets of bright gold
Oerflourishd Such the sires of those who now
As surely as your church is vacant flock
Into her consistory and at leisure
There stall them and grow fat The oerweening brood
That plays the dragon after him that flees
But unto such as turn and show the tooth
Ay or the purse is gentle as a lamb
Was on its rise but yet so slight esteemd
That Ubertino of Donati grudgd
His fatherinlaw should yoke him to its tribe
Already Caponsacco had descended
Into the mart from Fesole and Giuda
And Infangato were good citizens
A thing incredible I tell tho true
The gateway named from those of Pera led
Into the narrow circuit of your walls
Each one who bears the sightly quarterings
Of the great Baron he whose name and worth
The festival of Thomas still revives
His knighthood and his privilege retaind
Albeit one who borders them With gold
This day is mingled with the common herd
In Borgo yet the Gualterotti dwelt
And Importuni well for its repose
Had it still lackd of newer neighbourhood
The house from whence your tears have had their spring
Through the just anger that hath murderd ye
And put a period to your gladsome days
Was honourd it and those consorted with it
O Buondelmonte what ill counseling
Prevaild on thee to break the plighted bond
Many who now are weeping would rejoice
Had God to Ema givn thee the first time
Thou near our city camst But so was doomd
On that maimd stone set up to guard the bridge
At thy last peace the victim Florence fell
With these and others like to them I saw
Florence in such assurd tranquility
She had no cause at which to grieve with these
Saw her so glorious and so just that neer
The lily from the lance had hung reverse
Or through division been with vermeil dyed



CANTO XVII

Such as the youth who came to Clymene
To certify himself of that reproach
Which had been fastend on him he whose end
Still makes the fathers chary to their sons
Een such was I nor unobservd was such
Of Beatrice and that saintly lamp
Who had erewhile for me his station movd
When thus by lady Give thy wish free vent
That it may issue bearing true report
Of the minds impress not that aught thy words
May to our knowledge add but to the end
That thou mayst use thyself to own thy thirst
And men may mingle for thee when they hear
 O plant from whence I spring reverd and lovd
Who soarst so high a pitch thou seest as clear
As earthly thought determines two obtuse
In one triangle not containd so clear
Dost see contingencies ere in themselves
Existent looking at the point whereto
All times are present I the whilst I scald
With Virgil the soul purifying mount
And visited the nether world of woe
Touching my future destiny have heard
Words grievous though I feel me on all sides
Well squard to fortunes blows Therefore my will
Were satisfied to know the lot awaits me
The arrow seen beforehand slacks its flight
 So said I to the brightness which erewhile
To me had spoken and my will declard
As Beatrice willd explicitly
Nor with oracular response obscure
Such as or ere the Lamb of God was slain
Beguild the credulous nations but in terms
Precise and unambiguous lore replied
The spirit of paternal love enshrind
Yet in his smile apparent and thus spake
Contingency unfolded not to view
Upon the tablet of your mortal mold
Is all depicturd in the eternal sight
But hence deriveth not necessity
More then the tall ship hurried down the flood
Doth from the vision that reflects the scene
From thence as to the ear sweet harmony
From organ comes so comes before mine eye
The time prepard for thee Such as drivn out
From Athens by his cruel stepdames wiles
Hippolytus departed such must thou
Depart from Florence This they wish and this
Contrive and will ere long effectuate there
Where gainful merchandize is made of Christ
Throughout the livelong day The common cry
Will as t is ever wont affix the blame
Unto the party injurd but the truth
Shall in the vengeance it dispenseth find
A faithful witness Thou shall leave each thing
Belovd most dearly this is the first shaft
Shot from the bow of exile Thou shalt prove
How salt the savour is of others bread
How hard the passage to descend and climb
By others stairs But that shall gall thee most
Will he the worthless and vile company
With whom thou must be thrown into these straits
For all ungrateful impious all and mad
Shall turn gainst thee but in a little while
Theirs and not thine shall be the crimsond brow
Their course shall so evince their brutishness
T have taen thy stand apart shall well become thee
 First refuge thou must find first place of rest
In the great Lombards courtesy who bears
Upon the ladder perchd the sacred bird
He shall behold thee with such kind regard
That twixt ye two the contrary to that
Which falls twixt other men the granting shall
Forerun the asking With him shalt thou see
That mortal who was at his birth impress
So strongly from this star that of his deeds
The nations shall take note His unripe age
Yet holds him from observance for these wheels
Only nine years have compass him about
But ere the Gascon practice on great Harry
Sparkles of virtue shall shoot forth in him
In equal scorn of labours and of gold
His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely
As not to let the tongues een of his foes
Be idle in its praise Look thou to him
And his beneficence for he shall cause
Reversal of their lot to many people
Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes
And thou shalt bear this written in thy soul
Of him but tell it not and things he told
Incredible to those who witness them
Then added So interpret thou my son
What hath been told theeLo the ambushment
That a few circling seasons hide for thee
Yet envy not thy neighbours time extends
Thy span beyond their treasons chastisement
 Soon as the saintly spirit by his silence
Had shown the web which I had stretehd for him
Upon the warp was woven I began
As one who in perplexity desires
Counsel of other wise benign and friendly
My father well I mark how time spurs on
Toward me ready to inflict the blow
Which falls most heavily on him who most
Abandoned himself Therefore t is good
I should forecast that driven from the place
Most dear to me I may not lose myself
All others by my song Down through the world
Of infinite mourning and along the mount
From whose fair height my ladys eyes did lift me
And after through this heavn from light to light
Have I learnt that which if I tell again
It may with many woefully disrelish
And if I am a timid friend to truth
I fear my life may perish among those
To whom these days shall be of ancient date
 The brightness where enclosd the treasure smild
Which I had found there first shone glisteningly
Like to a golden mirror in the sun
Next answerd Conscience dimmd or by its own
Or others shame will feel thy saying sharp
Thou notwithstanding all deceit removd
See the whole vision be made manifest
And let them wince who have their withers wrung
What though when tasted first thy voice shall prove
Unwelcome on digestion it will turn
To vital nourishment The cry thou raisest
Shall as the wind doth smite the proudest summits
Which is of honour no light argument
For this there only have been shown to thee
Throughout these orbs the mountain and the deep
Spirits whom fame hath note of For the mind
Of him who hears is loth to acquiesce
And fix its faith unless the instance brought
Be palpable and proof apparent urge



CANTO XVIII

Now in his word sole ruminating joyd
That blessed spirit and I fed on mine
Tempting the sweet with bitter she meanwhile
Who led me unto God admonishd Muse
On other thoughts bethink thee that near Him
I dwell who recompenseth every wrong
 At the sweet sounds of comfort straight I turnd
And in the saintly eyes what love was seen
I leave in silence here nor through distrust
Of my words only but that to such bliss
The mind remounts not without aid Thus much
Yet may I speak that as I gazd on her
Affection found no room for other wish
While the everlasting pleasure that did full
On Beatrice shine with second view
From her fair countenance my gladdend soul
Contented vanquishing me with a beam
Of her soft smile she spake Turn thee and list
These eyes are not thy only Paradise
 As here we sometimes in the looks may see
Th affection markd when that its sway hath taen
The spirit wholly thus the hallowd light
To whom I turnd flashing bewrayd its will
To talk yet further with me and began
On this fifth lodgment of the tree whose life
Is from its top whose fruit is ever fair
And leaf unwithring blessed spirits abide
That were below ere they arrivd in heavn
So mighty in renown as every muse
Might grace her triumph with them On the horns
Look therefore of the cross he whom I name
Shall there enact as doth 1n summer cloud
Its nimble fire Along the cross I saw
At the repeated name of Joshua
A splendour gliding nor the word was said
Ere it was done then at the naming saw
Of the great Maccabee another move
With whirling speed and gladness was the scourge
Unto that top The next for Charlemagne
And for the peer Orlando two my gaze
Pursued intently as the eye pursues
A falcon flying Last along the cross
William and Renard and Duke Godfrey drew
My ken and Robert Guiscard And the soul
Who spake with me among the other lights
Did move away and mix and with the choir
Of heavnly songsters provd his tuneful skill
 To Beatrice on my right l bent
Looking for intimation or by word
Or act what next behoovd and did descry
Such mere effulgence in her eyes such joy
It past all former wont And as by sense
Of new delight the man who perseveres
In good deeds doth perceive from day to day
His virtue growing I een thus perceivd
Of my ascent together with the heavn
The circuit widend noting the increase
Of beauty in that wonder Like the change
In a brief moment on some maidens cheek
Which from its fairness doth discharge the weight
Of pudency that staind it such in her
And to mine eyes so sudden was the change
Through silvery whiteness of that temperate star
Whose sixth orb now enfolded us I saw
Within that Jovial cresset the clear sparks
Of love that reignd there fashion to my view
Our language And as birds from river banks
Arisen now in round now lengthend troop
Array them in their flight greeting as seems
Their newfound pastures so within the lights
The saintly creatures flying sang and made
Now D now I now L figurd I th air
First singing to their notes they movd then one
Becoming of these signs a little while
Did rest them and were mute O nymph divine
Of Pegasean race whose souls which thou
Inspirst makst glorious and longlivd as they
Cities and realms by thee thou with thyself
Inform me that I may set forth the shapes
As fancy doth present them Be thy power
Displayd in this brief song The characters
Vocal and consonant were fivefold seven
In order each as they appeard I markd
Diligite Justitiam the first
Both verb and noun all blazond and the extreme
Qui judicatis terram In the M
Of the fifth word they held their station
Making the star seem silver streakd with gold
And on the summit of the M I saw
Descending other lights that rested there
Singing methinks their bliss and primal good
Then as at shaking of a lighted brand
Sparkles innumerable on all sides
Rise scatterd source of augury to th unwise
Thus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence
Seemd reascending and a higher pitch
Some mounting and some less een as the sun
Which kindleth them decreed And when each one
Had settled in his place the head and neck
Then saw I of an eagle lively
Gravd in that streaky fire Who painteth there
Hath none to guide him of himself he guides
And every line and texture of the nest
Doth own from him the virtue fashions it
The other bright beatitude that seemd
Erewhile with lilied crowning well content
To overcanopy the M movd forth
Following gently the impress of the bird
 Sweet star what glorious and thickstudded gems
Declard to me our justice on the earth
To be the effluence of that heavn which thou
Thyself a costly jewel dost inlay
Therefore I pray the Sovran Mind from whom
Thy motion and thy virtue are begun
That he would look from whence the fog doth rise
To vitiate thy beam so that once more
He may put forth his hand gainst such as drive
Their traffic in that sanctuary whose walls
With miracles and martyrdoms were built
 Ye host of heaven whose glory I survey l
O beg ye grace for those that are on earth
All after ill example gone astray
War once had for its instrument the sword
But now t is made taking the bread away
Which the good Father locks from none And thou
That writes but to cancel think that they
Who for the vineyard which thou wastest died
Peter and Paul live yet and mark thy doings
Thou hast good cause to cry My heart so cleaves
To him that livd in solitude remote
And from the wilds was draggd to martyrdom
I wist not of the fisherman nor Paul



CANTO XIX

Before my sight appeard with open wings
The beauteous image in fruition sweet
Gladdening the thronged spirits Each did seem
A little ruby whereon so intense
The sunbeam glowd that to mine eyes it came
In clear refraction And that which next
Befalls me to portray voice hath not utterd
Nor hath ink written nor in fantasy
Was eer conceivd For I beheld and heard
The beak discourse and what intention formd
Of many singly as of one express
Beginning For that I was just and piteous
l am exalted to this height of glory
The which no wish exceeds and there on earth
Have I my memory left een by the bad
Commended while they leave its course untrod
 Thus is one heat from many embers felt
As in that image many were the loves
And one the voice that issued from them all
Whence I address them O perennial flowers
Of gladness everlasting that exhale
In single breath your odours manifold
Breathe now and let the hunger be appeasd
That with great craving long hath held my soul
Finding no food on earth This well I know
That if there be in heavn a realm that shows
In faithful mirror the celestial Justice
Yours without veil reflects it Ye discern
The heed wherewith I do prepare myself
To hearken ye the doubt that urges me
With such inveterate craving Straight I saw
Like to a falcon issuing from the hood
That rears his head and claps him with his wings
His beauty and his eagerness bewraying
So saw I move that stately sign with praise
Of grace divine inwoven and high song
Of inexpressive joy He it began
Who turnd his compass on the worlds extreme
And in that space so variously hath wrought
Both openly and in secret in such wise
Could not through all the universe display
Impression of his glory that the Word
Of his omniscience should not still remain
In infinite excess In proof whereof
He first through pride supplanted who was sum
Of each created being waited not
For light celestial and abortive fell
Whence needs each lesser nature is but scant
Receptacle unto that Good which knows
No limit measurd by itself alone
Therefore your sight of th omnipresent Mind
A single beam its origin must own
Surpassing far its utmost potency
The ken your world is gifted with descends
In th everlasting Justice as low down
As eye doth in the sea which though it mark
The bottom from the shore in the wide main
Discerns it not and neertheless it is
But hidden through its deepness Light is none
Save that which cometh from the pure serene
Of neer disturbed ether for the rest
Tis darkness all or shadow of the flesh
Or else its poison Here confess reveald
That covert which hath hidden from thy search
The living justice of the which thou madst
Such frequent question for thou saidstA man
Is born on Indus banks and none is there
Who speaks of Christ nor who doth read nor write
And all his inclinations and his acts
As far as human reason sees are good
And he offendeth not in word or deed
But unbaptizd he dies and void of faith
Where is the justice that condemns him where
His blame if he believeth notWhat then
And who art thou that on the stool wouldst sit
To judge at distance of a thousand miles
With the shortsighted vision of a span
To him who subtilizes thus with me
There would assuredly be room for doubt
Even to wonder did not the safe word
Of scripture hold supreme authority
 O animals of clay O spirits gross I
The primal will that in itself is good
Hath from itself the chief Good neer been movd
Justice consists in consonance with it
Derivable by no created good
Whose very cause depends upon its beam
 As on her nest the stork that turns about
Unto her young whom lately she hath fed
While they with upward eyes do look on her
So lifted I my gaze and bending so
The everblessed image wavd its wings
Labring with such deep counsel Wheeling round
It warbled and did say As are my notes
To thee who understandst them not such is
Th eternal judgment unto mortal ken
 Then still abiding in that ensign rangd
Wherewith the Romans overawed the world
Those burning splendours of the Holy Spirit
Took up the strain and thus it spake again
None ever hath ascended to this realm
Who hath not a believer been in Christ
Either before or after the blest limbs
Were naild upon the wood But lo of those
Who call Christ Christ there shall be many found
 In judgment further off from him by far
Than such to whom his name was never known
Christians like these the Ethiop shall condemn
When that the two assemblages shall part
One rich eternally the other poor
 What may the Persians say unto your kings
When they shall see that volume in the which
All their dispraise is written spread to view
There amidst Alberts works shall that be read
Which will give speedy motion to the pen
When Prague shall mourn her desolated realm
There shall be read the woe that he doth work
With his adulterate money on the Seine
Who by the tusk will perish there be read
The thirsting pride that maketh fool alike
The English and Scot impatient of their bound
There shall be seen the Spaniards luxury
The delicate living there of the Bohemian
Who still to worth has been a willing stranger
The halter of Jerusalem shall see
A unit for his virtue for his vices
No less a mark than million He who guards
The isle of fire by old Anchises honourd
Shall find his avarice there and cowardice
And better to denote his littleness
The writing must be letters maimd that speak
Much in a narrow space All there shall know
His uncle and his brothers filthy doings
Who so renownd a nation and two crowns
Have bastardized And they of Portugal
And Norway there shall be exposd with him
Of Ratza who hath counterfeited ill
The coin of Venice O blest Hungary
If thou no longer patiently abidst
Thy illentreating and O blest Navarre
If with thy mountainous girdle thou wouldst arm thee
In earnest of that day een now are heard
Wailings and groans in Famagostas streets
And Nicosias grudging at their beast
Who keepeth even footing with the rest



CANTO XX

When disappearing from our hemisphere
The worlds enlightener vanishes and day
On all sides wasteth suddenly the sky
Erewhile irradiate only with his beam
Is yet again unfolded putting forth
Innumerable lights wherein one shines
Of such vicissitude in heaven I thought
As the great sign that marshaleth the world
And the worlds leaders in the blessed beak
Was silent for that all those living lights
Waxing in splendour burst forth into songs
Such as from memory glide and fall away
 Sweet love that dost apparel thee in smiles
How lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles
Which merely are from holy thoughts inspird
 After the precious and bright beaming stones
That did ingem the sixth light ceasd the chiming
Of their angelic bells methought I heard
The murmuring of a river that doth fall
From rock to rock transpicuous making known
The richness of his springhead and as sound
Of cistern at the fretboard or of pipe
Is at the windhole modulate and tund
Thus up the neck as it were hollow rose
That murmuring of the eagle and forthwith
Voice there assumd and thence along the beak
Issued in form of words such as my heart
Did look for on whose tables I inscribd them
 The part in me that sees and bears the sun
In mortal eagles it began must now
Be noted steadfastly for of the fires
That figure me those glittering in mine eye
Are chief of all the greatest This that shines
Midmost for pupil was the same who sang
The Holy Spirits song and bare about
The ark from town to town now doth he know
The merit of his soulimpassiond strains
By their wellfitted guerdon Of the five
That make the circle of the vision he
Who to the beak is nearest comforted
The widow for her son now doth he know
How dear he costeth not to follow Christ
Both from experience of this pleasant life
And of its opposite He next who follows
In the circumference for the over arch
By true repenting slackd the pace of death
Now knoweth he that the degrees of heavn
Alter not when through pious prayer below
Todays is made tomorrows destiny
The other following with the laws and me
To yield the shepherd room passd oer to Greece
From good intent producing evil fruit
Now knoweth he how all the ill derivd
From his well doing doth not helm him aught
Though it have brought destruction on the world
That which thou seest in the under bow
Was William whom that land bewails which weeps
For Charles and Frederick living now he knows
How well is lovd in heavn the righteous king
Which he betokens by his radiant seeming
Who in the erring world beneath would deem
That Trojan Ripheus in this round was set
Fifth of the saintly splendours now he knows
Enough of that which the world cannot see
The grace divine albeit een his sight
Reach not its utmost depth Like to the lark
That warbling in the air expatiates long
Then trilling out his last sweet melody
Drops satiate with the sweetness such appeard
That image stampt by the everlasting pleasure
Which fashions like itself all lovely things
 I though my doubting were as manifest
As is through glass the hue that mantles it
In silence waited not for to my lips
What things are these involuntary rushd
And forcd a passage out whereat I markd
A sudden lightening and new revelry
The eye was kindled and the blessed sign
No more to keep me wondring and suspense
Replied I see that thou believst these things
Because I tell them but discernst not how
So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith
As one who knows the name of thing by rote
But is a stranger to its properties
Till others tongue reveal them Fervent love
And lively hope with violence assail
The kingdom of the heavens and overcome
The will of the Most high not in such sort
As man prevails oer man but conquers it
Because t is willing to be conquerd still
Though conquerd by its mercy conquering
 Those in the eye who live the first and fifth
Cause thee to marvel in that thou beholdst
The region of the angels deckd with them
They quitted not their bodies as thou deemst
Gentiles but Christians in firm rooted faith
This of the feet in future to be piercd
That of feet naild already to the cross
One from the barrier of the dark abyss
Where never any with good will returns
Came back unto his bones Of lively hope
Such was the meed of lively hope that wingd
The prayers sent up to God for his release
And put power into them to bend his will
The glorious Spirit of whom I speak to thee
A little while returning to the flesh
Believd in him who had the means to help
And in believing nourishd such a flame
Of holy love that at the second death
He was made sharer in our gamesome mirth
The other through the riches of that grace
Which from so deep a fountain doth distil
As never eye created saw its rising
Placd all his love below on just and right
Wherefore of grace God opd in him the eye
To the redemption of mankind to come
Wherein believing he endurd no more
The filth of paganism and for their ways
Rebukd the stubborn nations The three nymphs
Whom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing
Were sponsors for him more than thousand years
Before baptizing O how far removd
Predestination is thy root from such
As see not the First cause entire and ye
O mortal men be wary how ye judge
For we who see our Maker know not yet
The number of the chosen and esteem
Such scantiness of knowledge our delight
For all our good is in that primal good
Concentrate and Gods will and ours are one
 So by that form divine was givn to me
Sweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight
And as one handling skillfully the harp
Attendant on some skilful songsters voice
Bids the chords vibrate and therein the song
Acquires more pleasure so the whilst it spake
It doth remember me that I beheld
The pair of blessed luminaries move
Like the accordant twinkling of two eyes
Their beamy circlets dancing to the sounds



CANTO XXI

Again mine eyes were fixd on Beatrice
And with mine eyes my soul that in her looks
Found all contentment Yet no smile she wore
And Did I smile quoth she thou wouldst be straight
Like Semele when into ashes turnd
For mounting these eternal palacestairs
My beauty which the loftier it climbs
As thou hast noted still doth kindle more
So shines that were no tempring interposd
Thy mortal puissance would from its rays
Shrink as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt
Into the seventh splendour are we wafted
That underneath the burning lions breast
Beams in this hour commingled with his might
Thy mind be with thine eyes and in them mirrord
The shape which in this mirror shall be shown
Whoso can deem how fondly I had fed
My sight upon her blissful countenance
May know when to new thoughts I changd what joy
To do the bidding of my heavnly guide
In equal balance poising either weight
 Within the crystal which records the name
As its remoter circle girds the world
Of that lovd monarch in whose happy reign
No ill had power to harm I saw reard up
In colour like to sunillumind gold
A ladder which my ken pursued in vain
So lofty was the summit down whose steps
I saw the splendours in such multitude
Descending evry light in heavn methought
Was shed thence As the rooks at dawn of day
Bestirring them to dry their feathers chill
Some speed their way afield and homeward some
Returning cross their flight while some abide
And wheel around their airy lodge so seemd
That glitterance wafted on alternate wing
As upon certain stair it met and clashd
Its shining And one lingring near us waxd
So bright that in my thought said The love
Which this betokens me admits no doubt
 Unwillingly from question I refrain
To her by whom my silence and my speech
Are orderd looking for a sign whence she
Who in the sight of Him that seeth all
Saw wherefore I was silent prompted me
T indulge the fervent wish and I began
I am not worthy of my own desert
That thou shouldst answer me but for her sake
Who hath vouchsafd my asking spirit blest
That in thy joy art shrouded say the cause
Which bringeth thee so near and wherefore say
Doth the sweet symphony of Paradise
Keep silence here pervading with such sounds
Of rapt devotion evry lower sphere
Mortal art thou in hearing as in sight
Was the reply and what forbade the smile
Of Beatrice interrupts our song
Only to yield thee gladness of my voice
And of the light that vests me I thus far
Descend these hallowd steps not that more love
Invites me for lo there aloft as much
Or more of love is witnessd in those flames
But such my lot by charity assignd
That makes us ready servants as thou seest
To execute the counsel of the Highest
That in this court said I O sacred lamp
Love no compulsion needs but follows free
Th eternal Providence I well discern
This harder find to deem why of thy peers
Thou only to this office wert foredoomd
I had not ended when like rapid mill
Upon its centre whirld the light and then
The love that did inhabit there replied
Splendour eternal piercing through these folds
Its virtue to my vision knits and thus
Supported lifts me so above myself
That on the sovran essence which it wells from
I have the power to gaze and hence the joy
Wherewith I sparkle equaling with my blaze
The keenness of my sight But not the soul
That is in heavn most lustrous nor the seraph
That hath his eyes most fixd on God shall solve
What thou hast askd for in th abyss it lies
Of th everlasting statute sunk so low
That no created ken may fathom it
And to the mortal world when thou returnst
Be this reported that none henceforth dare
Direct his footsteps to so dread a bourn
The mind that here is radiant on the earth
Is wrapt in mist Look then if she may do
Below what passeth her ability
When she is taen to heavn By words like these
Admonishd I the question urgd no more
And of the spirit humbly sued alone
T instruct me of its state Twixt either shore
Of Italy nor distant from thy land
A stony ridge ariseth in such sort
The thunder doth not lift his voice so high
They call it Catria at whose foot a cell
Is sacred to the lonely Eremite
For worship set apart and holy rites
A third time thus it spake then added There
So firmly to Gods service I adherd
That with no costlier viands than the juice
Of olives easily I passd the heats
Of summer and the winter frosts content
In heavnward musings Rich were the returns
And fertile which that cloister once was usd
To render to these heavens now t is falln
Into a waste so empty that ere long
Detection must lay bare its vanity
Pietro Damiano there was I yclept
Pietro the sinner when before I dwelt
Beside the Adriatic in the house
Of our blest Lady Near upon my close
Of mortal life through much importuning
I was constraind to wear the hat that still
From bad to worse it shiftedCephas came
He came who was the Holy Spirits vessel
Barefoot and lean eating their bread as chancd
At the first table Modern Shepherds need
Those who on either hand may prop and lead them
So burly are they grown and from behind
Others to hoist them Down the palfreys sides
Spread their broad mantles so as both the beasts
Are coverd with one skin O patience thou
That lookst on this and doth endure so long
I at those accents saw the splendours down
From step to step alight and wheel and wax
Each circuiting more beautiful Round this
They came and stayd them uttered them a shout
So loud it hath no likeness here nor I
Wist what it spake so deafning was the thunder



CANTO XXII

Astounded to the guardian of my steps
I turnd me like the chill who always runs
Thither for succour where he trusteth most
And she was like the mother who her son
Beholding pale and breathless with her voice
Soothes him and he is cheerd for thus she spake
Soothing me Knowst not thou thou art in heavn
And knowst not thou whatever is in heavn
Is holy and that nothing there is done
But is done zealously and well Deem now
What change in thee the song and what my smile
had wrought since thus the shout had powr to move thee
In which couldst thou have understood their prayers
The vengeance were already known to thee
Which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour
The sword of heavn is not in haste to smite
Nor yet doth linger save unto his seeming
Who in desire or fear doth look for it
But elsewhere now l bid thee turn thy view
So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold
Mine eyes directing as she willd I saw
A hundred little spheres that fairer grew
By interchange of splendour I remaind
As one who fearful of oermuch presuming
Abates in him the keenness of desire
Nor dares to question when amid those pearls
One largest and most lustrous onward drew
That it might yield contentment to my wish
And from within it these the sounds I heard
 If thou like me beheldst the charity
That burns amongst us what thy mind conceives
Were utterd But that ere the lofty bound
Thou reach expectance may not weary thee
I will make answer even to the thought
Which thou hast such respect of In old days
That mountain at whose side Cassino rests
Was on its height frequented by a race
Deceived and ill disposd and I it was
Who thither carried first the name of Him
Who brought the soulsubliming truth to man
And such a speeding grace shone over me
That from their impious worship I reclaimd
The dwellers round about who with the world
Were in delusion lost These other flames
The spirits of men contemplative were all
Enlivend by that warmth whose kindly force
Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness
Here is Macarius Romoaldo here
And here my brethren who their steps refraind
Within the cloisters and held firm their heart
 I answring thus Thy gentle words and kind
And this the cheerful semblance I behold
Not unobservant beaming in ye all
Have raisd assurance in me wakening it
Fullblossomd in my bosom as a rose
Before the sun when the consummate flower
Has spread to utmost amplitude Of thee
Therefore entreat I father to declare
If I may gain such favour as to gaze
Upon thine image by no covering veild
 Brother he thus rejoind in the last sphere
Expect completion of thy lofty aim
For there on each desire completion waits
And there on mine where every aim is found
Perfect entire and for fulfillment ripe
There all things are as they have ever been
For space is none to bound nor pole divides
Our ladder reaches even to that clime
And so at giddy distance mocks thy view
Thither the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretch
Its topmost round when it appeard to him
With angels laden But to mount it now
None lifts his foot from earth and hence my rule
Is left a profitless stain upon the leaves
The walls for abbey reard turned into dens
The cowls to sacks choakd up with musty meal
Foul usury doth not more lift itself
Against Gods pleasure than that fruit which makes
The hearts of monks so wanton for whateer
Is in the churchs keeping all pertains
To such as sue for heavns sweet sake and not
To those who in respect of kindred claim
Or on more vile allowance Mortal flesh
Is grown so dainty good beginnings last not
From the oaks birth unto the acorns setting
His convent Peter founded without gold
Or silver I with prayrs and fasting mine
And Francis his in meek humility
And if thou note the point whence each proceeds
Then look what it hath errd to thou shalt find
The white grown murky Jordan was turnd back
And a less wonder then the refluent sea
May at Gods pleasure work amendment here
 So saying to his assembly back he drew
And they together clusterd into one
Then all rolld upward like an eddying wind
 The sweet dame beckond me to follow them
And by that influence only so prevaild
Over my nature that no natural motion
Ascending or descending here below
Had as I mounted with my pennon vied
 So reader as my hope is to return
Unto the holy triumph for the which
I ofttimes wail my sins and smite my breast
Thou hadst been longer drawing out and thrusting
Thy finger in the fire than I was ere
The sign that followeth Taurus I beheld
And enterd its precinct O glorious stars
O light impregnate with exceeding virtue
To whom whateer of genius lifteth me
Above the vulgar grateful I refer
With ye the parent of all mortal life
Arose and set when I did first inhale
The Tuscan air and afterward when grace
Vouchsafd me entrance to the lofty wheel
That in its orb impels ye fate decreed
My passage at your clime To you my soul
Devoutly sighs for virtue even now
To meet the hard emprize that draws me on
 Thou art so near the sum of blessedness
Said Beatrice that behooves thy ken
Be vigilant and clear And to this end
Or even thou advance thee further hence
Look downward and contemplate what a world
Already stretched under our feet there lies
So as thy heart may in its blithest mood
Present itself to the triumphal throng
Which through the etherial concave comes rejoicing
 I straight obeyd and with mine eye returnd
Through all the seven spheres and saw this globe
So pitiful of semblance that perforce
It moved my smiles and him in truth I hold
For wisest who esteems it least whose thoughts
Elsewhere are fixd him worthiest call and best
I saw the daughter of Latona shine
Without the shadow whereof late I deemd
That dense and rare were cause Here I sustaind
The visage Hyperion of thy sun
And markd how near him with their circle round
Move Maia and Dione here discernd
Joves tempering twixt his sire and son and hence
Their changes and their various aspects
Distinctly scannd Nor might I not descry
Of all the seven how bulky each how swift
Nor of their several distances not learn
This petty area oer the which we stride
So fiercely as along the eternal twins
I wound my way appeard before me all
Forth from the havens stretchd unto the hills
Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes returnd



CANTO XXIII

Een as the bird who midst the leafy bower
Has in her nest sat darkling through the night
With her sweet brood impatient to descry
Their wished looks and to bring home their food
In the fond quest unconscious of her toil
She of the time prevenient on the spray
That overhangs their couch with wakeful gaze
Expects the sun nor ever till the dawn
Removeth from the east her eager ken
So stood the dame erect and bent her glance
Wistfully on that region where the sun
Abateth most his speed that seeing her
Suspense and wandring I became as one
In whom desire is wakend and the hope
Of somewhat new to come fills with delight
 Short space ensued I was not held I say
Long in expectance when I saw the heavn
Wax more and more resplendent and Behold
Cried Beatrice the triumphal hosts
Of Christ and all the harvest reapd at length
Of thy ascending up these spheres Meseemd
That while she spake her image all did burn
And in her eyes such fullness was of joy
And I am fain to pass unconstrued by
 As in the calm full moon when Trivia smiles
In peerless beauty mid th eternal nympus
That paint through all its gulfs the blue profound
In bright preeminence so saw I there
Oer million lamps a sun from whom all drew
Their radiance as from ours the starry train
And through the living light so lustrous glowd
The substance that my ken endurd it not
 O Beatrice sweet and precious guide
Who cheerd me with her comfortable words
Against the virtue that oerpowreth thee
Avails not to resist Here is the might
And here the wisdom which did open lay
The path that had been yearned for so long
Betwixt the heavn and earth Like to the fire
That in a cloud imprisond doth break out
Expansive so that from its womb enlargd
It falleth against nature to the ground
Thus in that heavnly banqueting my soul
Outgrew herself and in the transport lost
Holds now remembrance none of what she was
 Ope thou thine eyes and mark me thou hast seen
Things that empower thee to sustain my smile
 I was as one when a forgotten dream
Doth come across him and he strives in vain
To shape it in his fantasy again
Whenas that gracious boon was profferd me
Which never may be canceld from the book
Wherein the past is written Now were all
Those tongues to sound that have on sweetest milk
Of Polyhymnia and her sisters fed
And fattend not with all their help to boot
Unto the thousandth parcel of the truth
My song might shadow forth that saintly smile
flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought
And with such figuring of Paradise
The sacred strain must leap like one that meets
A sudden interruption to his road
But he who thinks how ponderous the theme
And that t is lain upon a mortal shoulder
May pardon if it tremble with the burden
The track our ventrous keel must furrow brooks
No unribbd pinnace no selfsparing pilot
 Why doth my face said Beatrice thus
Enamour thee as that thou dost not turn
Unto the beautiful garden blossoming
Beneath the rays of Christ Here is the rose
Wherein the word divine was made incarnate
And here the lilies by whose odour known
The way of life was followd Prompt I heard
Her bidding and encounter once again
The strife of aching vision As erewhile
Through glance of sunlight streamd through broken cloud
Mine eyes a flowerbesprinkled mead have seen
Though veild themselves in shade so saw I there
Legions of splendours on whom burning rays
Shed lightnings from above yet saw I not
The fountain whence they flowd O gracious virtue
Thou whose broad stamp is on them higher up
Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room
To my oerlabourd sight when at the name
Of that fair flower whom duly I invoke
Both morn and eve my soul with all her might
Collected on the goodliest ardour fixd
And as the bright dimensions of the star
In heavn excelling as once here on earth
Were in my eyeballs lively portrayd
Lo from within the sky a cresset fell
Circling in fashion of a diadem
And girt the star and hovring round it wheeld
 Whatever melody sounds sweetest here
And draws the spirit most unto itself
Might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder
Compard unto the sounding of that lyre
Wherewith the goodliest sapphire that inlays
The floor of heavn was crownd  Angelic Love
I am who thus with hovring flight enwheel
The lofty rapture from that womb inspird
Where our desire did dwell and round thee so
Lady of Heavn will hover long as thou
Thy Son shalt follow and diviner joy
Shall from thy presence gild the highest sphere
 Such close was to the circling melody
And as it ended all the other lights
Took up the strain and echoed Marys name
 The robe that with its regal folds enwraps
The world and with the nearer breath of God
Doth burn and quiver held so far retird
Its inner hem and skirting over us
That yet no glimmer of its majesty
Had streamd unto me therefore were mine eyes
Unequal to pursue the crowned flame
That rose and sought its natal seed of fire
And like to babe that stretches forth its arms
For very eagerness towards the breast
After the milk is taken so outstretchd
Their wavy summits all the fervent band
Through zealous love to Mary then in view
There halted and Regina Coeli  sang
So sweetly the delight hath left me never
 O what oerflowing plenty is uppild
In those richladen coffers which below
Sowd the good seed whose harvest now they keep
 Here are the treasures tasted that with tears
Were in the Babylonian exile won
When gold had faild them Here in synod high
Of ancient council with the new convend
Under the Son of Mary and of God
Victorious he his mighty triumph holds
To whom the keys of glory were assignd



CANTO XXIV

O ye in chosen fellowship advancd
To the great supper of the blessed Lamb
Whereon who feeds hath every wish fulfilld
If to this man through Gods grace be vouchsafd
Foretaste of that which from your table falls
Or ever death his fated term prescribe
Be ye not heedless of his urgent will
But may some influence of your sacred dews
Sprinkle him Of the fount ye alway drink
Whence flows what most he craves Beatrice spake
And the rejoicing spirits like to spheres
On firmset poles revolving traild a blaze
Of comet splendour and as wheels that wind
Their circles in the horologe so work
The stated rounds that to th observant eye
The first seems still and as it flew the last
Een thus their carols weaving variously
They by the measure pacd or swift or slow
Made me to rate the riches of their joy
 From that which I did note in beauty most
Excelling saw I issue forth a flame
So bright as none was left more goodly there
Round Beatrice thrice it wheeld about
With so divine a song that fancys ear
Records it not and the pen passeth on
And leaves a blank for that our mortal speech
Nor een the inward shaping of the brain
Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds
 O saintly sister mine thy prayer devout
Is with so vehement affection urgd
Thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere
 Such were the accents towards my lady breathd
From that blest ardour soon as it was stayd
To whom she thus O everlasting light
Of him within whose mighty grasp our Lord
Did leave the keys which of this wondrous bliss
He bare below tent this man as thou wilt
With lighter probe or deep touching the faith
By the which thou didst on the billows walk
If he in love in hope and in belief
Be steadfast is not hid from thee for thou
Hast there thy ken where all things are beheld
In liveliest portraiture But since true faith
Has peopled this fair realm with citizens
Meet is that to exalt its glory more
Thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse
 Like to the bachelor who arms himself
And speaks not till the master have proposd
The question to approve and not to end it
So I in silence armd me while she spake
Summoning up each argument to aid
As was behooveful for such questioner
And such profession As good Christian ought
Declare thee What is faith Whereat I raisd
My forehead to the light whence this had breathd
Then turnd to Beatrice and in her looks
Approval met that from their inmost fount
I should unlock the waters May the grace
That giveth me the captain of the church
For confessor said I vouchsafe to me
Apt utterance for my thoughts then added Sire
Een as set down by the unerring style
Of thy dear brother who with thee conspird
To bring Rome in unto the way of life
Faith of things hopd is substance and the proof
Of things not seen and herein doth consist
Methinks its essence Rightly hast thou deemd
Was answerd if thou well discern why first
He hath defind it substance and then proof
 The deep things I replied which here I scan
Distinctly are below from mortal eye
So hidden they have in belief alone
Their being on which credence hope sublime
Is built and therefore substance it intends
And inasmuch as we must needs infer
From such belief our reasoning all respect
To other view excluded hence of proof
Th intention is derivd Forthwith I heard
If thus whateer by learning men attain
Were understood the sophist would want room
To exercise his wit So breathd the flame
Of love then added Current is the coin
Thou utterst both in weight and in alloy
But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse
 Even so glittering and so round said I
I not a whit misdoubt of its assay
 Next issued from the deep imbosomd splendour
Say whence the costly jewel on the which
Is founded every virtue came to thee
The flood I answerd from the Spirit of God
Raind down upon the ancient bond and new
Here is the reasning that convinceth me
So feelingly each argument beside
Seems blunt and forceless in comparison
Then heard I Wherefore holdest thou that each
The elder proposition and the new
Which so persuade thee are the voice of heavn
 The works that followd evidence their truth 
I answerd Nature did not make for these
The iron hot or on her anvil mould them
Who voucheth to thee of the works themselves
Was the reply that they in very deed
Are that they purport None hath sworn so to thee
 That all the world said I should have bee turnd
To Christian and no miracle been wrought
Would in itself be such a miracle
The rest were not an hundredth part so great
Een thou wentst forth in poverty and hunger
To set the goodly plant that from the vine
It once was now is grown unsightly bramble
That ended through the high celestial court
Resounded all the spheres Praise we one God
In song of most unearthly melody
And when that Worthy thus from branch to branch
Examining had led me that we now
Approachd the topmost bough he straight resumd
The grace that holds sweet dalliance with thy soul
So far discreetly hath thy lips unclosd
That whatsoeer has past them I commend
Behooves thee to express what thou believst
The next and whereon thy belief hath grown
 O saintly sire and spirit I began
Who seest that which thou didst so believe
As to outstrip feet younger than thine own
Toward the sepulchre thy will is here
That I the tenour of my creed unfold
And thou the cause of it hast likewise askd
And I reply I in one God believe
One sole eternal Godhead of whose love
All heavn is movd himself unmovd the while
Nor demonstration physical alone
Or more intelligential and abstruse
Persuades me to this faith but from that truth
It cometh to me rather which is shed
Through Moses the rapt Prophets and the Psalms
The Gospel and that ye yourselves did write
When ye were gifted of the Holy Ghost
In three eternal Persons I believe
Essence threefold and one mysterious league
Of union absolute which many a time
The word of gospel lore upon my mind
Imprints and from this germ this firstling spark
The lively flame dilates and like heavns star
Doth glitter in me As the master hears
Well pleasd and then enfoldeth in his arms
The servant who hath joyful tidings brought
And having told the errand keeps his peace
Thus benediction uttering with song
Soon as my peace I held compassd me thrice
The apostolic radiance whose behest
Had opd lips so well their answer pleasd



CANTO XXV

If eer the sacred poem that hath made
Both heavn and earth copartners in its toil
And with lean abstinence through many a year
Faded my brow be destind to prevail
Over the cruelty which bars me forth
Of the fair sheepfold where a sleeping lamb
The wolves set on and fain had worried me
With other voice and fleece of other grain
I shall forthwith return and standing up
At my baptismal font shall claim the wreath
Due to the poets temples for I there
First enterd on the faith which maketh souls
Acceptable to God and for its sake
Peter had then circled my forehead thus
 Next from the squadron whence had issued forth
The first fruit of Christs vicars on the earth
Toward us movd a light at view whereof
My Lady full of gladness spake to me
Lo lo behold the peer of mickle might
That makes Falicia throngd with visitants
 As when the ringdove by his mate alights
In circles each about the other wheels
And murmuring cooes his fondness thus saw I
One of the other great and glorious prince
With kindly greeting haild extolling both
Their heavenly banqueting but when an end
Was to their gratulation silent each
Before me sat they down so burning bright
I could not look upon them Smiling then
Beatrice spake O life in glory shrind
Who didst the largess of our kingly court
Set down with faithful pen let now thy voice
Of hope the praises in this height resound
For thou who figurst them in shapes as clear
As Jesus stood before thee well canst speak them
 Lift up thy head and be thou strong in trust
For that which hither from the mortal world
Arriveth must be ripend in our beam
 Such cheering accents from the second flame
Assurd me and mine eyes I lifted up
Unto the mountains that had bowd them late
With overheavy burden Sith our Liege
Wills of his grace that thou or ere thy death
In the most secret council with his lords
Shouldst be confronted so that having viewd
The glories of our court thou mayst therewith
Thyself and all who hear invigorate
With hope that leads to blissful end declare
What is that hope how it doth flourish in thee
And whence thou hadst it Thus proceeding still
The second light and she whose gentle love
My soaring pennons in that lofty flight
Escorted thus preventing me rejoind
Among her sons not one more full of hope
Hath the church militant so t is of him
Recorded in the sun whose liberal orb
Enlighteneth all our tribe and ere his term
Of warfare hence permitted he is come
From Egypt to Jerusalem to see
The other points both which thou hast inquird
Not for more knowledge but that he may tell
How dear thou holdst the virtue these to him
Leave I for he may answer thee with ease
And without boasting so God give him grace
Like to the scholar practisd in his task
Who willing to give proof of diligence
Seconds his teacher gladly Hope said I
Is of the joy to come a sure expectance
Th effect of grace divine and merit preceding
This light from many a star visits my heart
But flowd to me the first from him who sang
The songs of the Supreme himself supreme
Among his tuneful brethren Let all hope
In thee so speak his anthem who have known
Thy name and with my faith who know not that
From thee the next distilling from his spring
In thine epistle fell on me the drops
So plenteously that I on others shower
The influence of their dew Whileas I spake
A lamping as of quick and vollied lightning
Within the bosom of that mighty sheen
Playd tremulous then forth these accents breathd
Love for the virtue which attended me
Een to the palm and issuing from the field
Glows vigorous yet within me and inspires
To ask of thee whom also it delights
What promise thou from hope in chief dost win
 Both scriptures new and ancient I replyd
Propose the mark which even now I view
For souls belovd of God Isaias saith
 That in their own land each one must be clad
In twofold vesture and their proper lands this delicious life
In terms more full
And clearer far thy brother hath set forth
This revelation to us where he tells
Of the white raiment destind to the saints
And as the words were ending from above
They hope in thee first heard we cried whereto
Answerd the carols all Amidst them next
A light of so clear amplitude emergd
That winters month were but a single day
Were such a crystal in the Cancers sign
 Like as a virgin riseth up and goes
And enters on the mazes of the dance
Though gay yet innocent of worse intent
Than to do fitting honour to the bride
So I beheld the new effulgence come
Unto the other two who in a ring
Wheeld as became their rapture In the dance
And in the song it mingled And the dame
Held on them fixd her looks een as the spouse
Silent and moveless This is he who lay
Upon the bosom of our pelican
This he into whose keeping from the cross
The mighty charge was given Thus she spake
Yet therefore naught the more removd her Sight
From marking them or ere her words began
Or when they closd As he who looks intent
And strives with searching ken how he may see
The sun in his eclipse and through desire
Of seeing loseth power of sight so I
Peerd on that last resplendence while I heard
Why dazzlest thou thine eyes in seeking that
Which here abides not Earth my body is
In earth and shall be with the rest so long
As till our number equal the decree
Of the Most High The two that have ascended
In this our blessed cloister shine alone
With the two garments So report below
 As when for ease of labour or to shun
Suspected peril at a whistles breath
The oars erewhile dashd frequent in the wave
All rest the flamy circle at that voice
So rested and the mingling sound was still
Which from the trinal band softbreathing rose
I turnd but ah how trembled in my thought
When looking at my side again to see
Beatrice I descried her not although
Not distant on the happy coast she stood



CANTO XXVI

With dazzled eyes whilst wondring I remaind
Forth of the beamy flame which dazzled me
Issued a breath that in attention mute
Detaind me and these words it spake T were well
That long as till thy vision on my form
Oerspent regain its virtue with discourse
Thou compensate the brief delay Say then
Beginning to what point thy soul aspires
And meanwhile rest assurd that sight in thee
Is but oerpowered a space not wholly quenchd
Since thy fair guide and lovely in her look
Hath potency the like to that which dwelt
In Ananias hand I answering thus
Be to mine eyes the remedy or late
Or early at her pleasure for they were
The gates at which she enterd and did light
Her never dying fire My wishes here
Are centered in this palace is the weal
That Alpha and Omega is to all
The lessons love can read me Yet again
The voice which had dispersd my fear when dazd
With that excess to converse urgd and spake
Behooves thee sift more narrowly thy terms
And say who leveld at this scope thy bow
 Philosophy said I hath arguments
And this place hath authority enough
T imprint in me such love for of constraint
Good inasmuch as we perceive the good
Kindles our love and in degree the more
As it comprises more of goodness in t
The essence then where such advantage is
That each good found without it is naught else
But of his light the beam must needs attract
The soul of each one loving who the truth
Discerns on which this proof is built Such truth
Learn I from him who shows me the first love
Of all intelligential substances
Eternal from his voice I learn whose word
Is truth that of himself to Moses saith
I will make all my good before thee pass
Lastly from thee I learn who chief proclaimst
Een at the outset of thy heralding
In mortal ears the mystery of heavn
 Through human wisdom and th authority
Therewith agreeing heard I answerd keep
The choicest of thy love for God But say
If thou yet other cords within thee feelst
That draw thee towards him so that thou report
How many are the fangs with which this love
Is grappled to thy soul I did not miss
To what intent the eagle of our Lord
Had pointed his demand yea noted well
Th avowal which he led to and resumd
All grappling bonds that knit the heart to God
Confederate to make fast our clarity
The being of the world and mine own being
The death which he endurd that I should live
And that which all the faithful hope as I do
To the forementiond lively knowledge joind
Have from the sea of ill love savd my bark
And on the coast securd it of the right
As for the leaves that in the garden bloom
My love for them is great as is the good
Dealt by th eternal hand that tends them all
 I ended and therewith a song most sweet
Rang through the spheres and Holy holy holy
Accordant with the rest my lady sang
And as a sleep is broken and dispersd
Through sharp encounter of the nimble light
With the eyes spirit running forth to meet
The ray from membrane on to the membrane urgd
And the upstartled wight loathes that be sees
So at his sudden waking he misdeems
Of all around him till assurance waits
On better judgment thus the saintly came
Drove from before mine eyes the motes away
With the resplendence of her own that cast
Their brightness downward thousand miles below
Whence I my vision clearer shall before
Recoverd and well nigh astounded askd
Of a fourth light that now with us I saw
 And Beatrice The first diving soul
That ever the first virtue framd admires
Within these rays his Maker Like the leaf
That bows its lithe top till the blast is blown
By its own virtue reard then stands aloof
So I the whilst she said awestricken bowd
Then eagerness to speak emboldend me
And I began O fruit that wast alone
Mature when first engenderd Ancient father
That doubly seest in every wedded bride
Thy daughter by affinity and blood
Devoutly as I may I pray thee hold
Converse with me my will thou seest and I
More speedily to hear thee tell it not 
 It chanceth oft some animal bewrays
Through the sleek covring of his furry coat
The fondness that stirs in him and conforms
His outside seeming to the cheer within
And in like guise was Adams spirit movd
To joyous mood that through the covering shone
Transparent when to pleasure me it spake
No need thy will be told which I untold
Better discern than thou whatever thing
Thou holdst most certain for that will I see
In Him who is truths mirror and Himself
Parhelion unto all things and naught else
To him This wouldst thou hear how long since God
Placd me high garden from whose hounds
She led me up in this ladder steep and long
What space endurd my season of delight
Whence truly sprang the wrath that banishd me
And what the language which I spake and framd
Not that I tasted of the tree my son
Was in itself the cause of that exile
But only my transgressing of the mark
Assignd me There whence at thy ladys hest
The Mantuan movd him still was I debarrd
This council till the sun had made complete
Four thousand and three hundred rounds and twice
His annual journey and through every light
In his broad pathway saw I him return
Thousand save sevnty times the whilst I dwelt
Upon the earth The language I did use
Was worn away or ever Nimrods race
Their unaccomplishable work began
For naught that man inclines to ere was lasting
Left by his reason free and variable
As is the sky that sways him That he speaks
Is natures prompting whether thus or thus
She leaves to you as ye do most affect it
Ere I descended into hells abyss
El was the name on earth of the Chief Good
Whose joy enfolds me Eli then t was calld
And so beseemeth for in mortals use
Is as the leaf upon the bough that goes
And other comes instead Upon the mount
Most high above the waters all my life
Both innocent and guilty did but reach
From the first hour to that which cometh next
As the sun changes quarter to the sixth



CANTO XXVII

Then Glory to the Father to the Son
And to the Holy Spirit rang aloud
Throughout all Paradise that with the song
My spirit reeld so passing sweet the strain
And what I saw was equal ecstasy
One universal smile it seemd of all things
Joy past compare gladness unutterable
Imperishable life of peace and love
Exhaustless riches and unmeasurd bliss
 Before mine eyes stood the four torches lit
And that which first had come began to wax
In brightness and in semblance such became
As Jove might be if he and Mars were birds
And interchangd their plumes Silence ensued
Through the blest quire by Him who here appoints
Vicissitude of ministry enjoind
When thus I heard Wonder not if my hue
Be changd for while I speak these shalt thou see
All in like manner change with me My place
He who usurps on earth my place ay mine
Which in the presence of the Son of God
Is void the same hath made my cemetery
A common sewer of puddle and of blood
The more below his triumph who from hence
Malignant fell Such colour as the sun
At eve or morning paints and adverse cloud
Then saw I sprinkled over all the sky
And as th unblemishd dame who in herself
Secure of censure yet at bare report
Of others failing shrinks with maiden fear
So Beatrice in her semblance changd
And such eclipse in heavn methinks was seen
When the Most Holy sufferd Then the words
Proceeded with voice alterd from itself
So clean the semblance did not alter more
Not to this end was Christs spouse with my blood
With that of Linus and of Cletus fed
That she might serve for purchase of base gold
But for the purchase of this happy life
Did Sextus Pius and Callixtus bleed
And Urban they whose doom was not without
Much weeping seald No purpose was of our
That on the right hand of our successors
Part of the Christian people should be set
And part upon their left nor that the keys
Which were vouchsafd me should for ensign serve
Unto the banners that do levy war
On the baptizd nor I for sigilmark
Set upon sold and lying privileges
Which makes me oft to bicker and turn red
In shepherds clothing greedy wolves below
Range wide oer all the pastures Arm of God
Why longer sleepst thou Caorsines and Gascona
Prepare to quaff our blood O good beginning
To what a vile conclusion must thou stoop
But the high providence which did defend
Through Scipio the worlds glory unto Rome
Will not delay its succour and thou son
Who through thy mortal weight shall yet again
Return below open thy lips nor hide
What is by me not hidden As a Hood
Of frozen vapours streams adown the air
What time the shegoat with her skiey horn
Touches the sun so saw I there stream wide
The vapours who with us had lingerd late
And with glad triumph deck th ethereal cope
Onward my sight their semblances pursued
So far pursued as till the space between
From its reach severd them whereat the guide
Celestial marking me no more intent
On upward gazing said Look down and see
What circuit thou hast compassd From the hour
When I before had cast my view beneath
All the first region overpast I saw
Which from the midmost to the boundry winds
That onward thence from Gades I beheld
The unwise passage of Laertes son
And hitherward the shore where thou Europa
Madst thee a joyful burden and yet more
Of this dim spot had seen but that the sun
A constellation off and more had taen
His progress in the zodiac underneath
 Then by the spirit that doth never leave
Its amorous dalliance with my ladys looks
Back with redoubled ardour were mine eyes
Led unto her and from her radiant smiles
Whenas I turnd me pleasure so divine
Did lighten on me that whatever bait
Or art or nature in the human flesh
Or in its limnd resemblance can combine
Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal
Were to her beauty nothing Its boon influence
From the fair nest of Leda rapt me forth
And wafted on into the swiftest heavn
 What place for entrance Beatrice chose
I may not say so uniform was all
Liveliest and loftiest She my secret wish
Divind and with such gladness that Gods love
Seemd from her visage shining thus began
Here is the goal whence motion on his race
Starts motionless the centre and the rest
All movd around Except the soul divine
Place in this heavn is none the soul divine
Wherein the love which ruleth oer its orb
Is kindled and the virtue that it sheds
One circle light and love enclasping it
As this doth clasp the others and to Him
Who draws the bound its limit only known
Measurd itself by none it doth divide
Motion to all counted unto them forth
As by the fifth or half ye count forth ten
The vase wherein times roots are plungd thou seest
Look elsewhere for the leaves O mortal lust
That canst not lift thy head above the waves
Which whelm and sink thee down The will in man
Bears goodly blossoms but its ruddy promise
Is by the dripping of perpetual rain
Made mere abortion faith and innocence
Are met with but in babes each taking leave
Ere cheeks with down are sprinkled he that fasts
While yet a stammerer with his tongue let loose
Gluts every food alike in every moon
One yet a babbler loves and listens to
His mother but no sooner hath free use
Of speech than he doth wish her in her grave
So suddenly doth the fair child of him
Whose welcome is the morn and eve his parting
To negro blackness change her virgin white
 Thou to abate thy wonder note that none
Bears rule in earth and its frail family
Are therefore wandrers Yet before the date
When through the hundredth in his reckning drops
Pale January must be shord aside
From winters calendar these heavnly spheres
Shall roar so loud that fortune shall be fain
To turn the poop where she hath now the prow
So that the fleet run onward and true fruit
Expected long shall crown at last the bloom



CANTO XXVIII

So she who doth imparadise my soul
Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life
And bard the truth of poor mortality
When lo as one who in a mirror spies
The shining of a flambeau at his back
Lit sudden ore he deem of its approach
And turneth to resolve him if the glass
Have told him true and sees the record faithful
As note is to its metre even thus
I well remember did befall to me
Looking upon the beauteous eyes whence love
Had made the leash to take me As I turnd
And that which in their circles none who spies
Can miss of in itself apparent struck
On mine a point I saw that darted light
So sharp no lid unclosing may bear up
Against its keenness The least star we view
From hence had seemd a moon set by its side
As star by side of star And so far off
Perchance as is the halo from the light
Which paints it when most dense the vapour spreads
There wheeld about the point a circle of fire
More rapid than the motion which first girds
The world Then circle after circle round
Enringd each other till the seventh reachd
Circumference so ample that its bow
Within the span of Junos messenger
lied scarce been held entire Beyond the sevnth
Followd yet other two And every one
As more in number distant from the first
Was tardier in motion and that glowd
With flame most pure that to the sparkle of truth
Was nearest as partaking most methinks
Of its reality The guide belovd
Saw me in anxious thought suspense and spake
Heavn and all nature hangs upon that point
The circle thereto most conjoind observe
And know that by intenser love its course
Is to this swiftness wingd To whom I thus
It were enough nor should I further seek
Had I but witnessd order in the world
Appointed such as in these wheels is seen
But in the sensible world such diffrence is
That is each round shows more divinity
As each is wider from the centre Hence
If in this wondrous and angelic temple
That hath for confine only light and love
My wish may have completion I must know
Wherefore such disagreement is between
Th exemplar and its copy for myself
Contemplating I fail to pierce the cause
 It is no marvel if thy fingers foild
Do leave the knot untied so hard t is grown
For want of tenting Thus she said But take
She added if thou wish thy cure my words
And entertain them subtly Every orb
Corporeal doth proportion its extent
Unto the virtue through its parts diffusd
The greater blessedness preserves the more
The greater is the body if all parts
Share equally the more is to preserve
Therefore the circle whose swift course enwheels
The universal frame answers to that
Which is supreme in knowledge and in love
Thus by the virtue not the seeming breadth
Of substance measure thou shalt see the heavns
Each to the intelligence that ruleth it
Greater to more and smaller unto less
Suited in strict and wondrous harmony
 As when the sturdy north blows from his cheek
A blast that scours the sky forthwith our air
Cleard of the rack that hung on it before
Glitters and With his beauties all unveild
The firmament looks forth serene and smiles
Such was my cheer when Beatrice drove
With clear reply the shadows back and truth
Was manifested as a star in heaven
And when the words were ended not unlike
To iron in the furnace every cirque
Ebullient shot forth scintillating fires
And every sparkle shivering to new blaze
In number did outmillion the account
Reduplicate upon the chequerd board
Then heard I echoing on from choir to choir
Hosanna to the fixed point that holds
And shall for ever hold them to their place
From everlasting irremovable
 Musing awhile I stood and she who saw
by inward meditations thus began
In the first circles they whom thou beheldst
Are seraphim and cherubim Thus swift
Follow their hoops in likeness to the point
Near as they can approaching and they can
The more the loftier their vision Those
That round them fleet gazing the Godhead next
Are thrones in whom the first trine ends And all
Are blessed even as their sight descends
Deeper into the truth wherein rest is
For every mind Thus happiness hath root
In seeing not in loving which of sight
Is aftergrowth And of the seeing such
The meed as unto each in due degree
Grace and goodwill their measure have assignd
The other trine that with still opening buds
In this eternal springtide blossom fair
Fearless of bruising from the nightly ram
Breathe up in warbled melodies threefold
Hosannas blending ever from the three
Transmitted hierarchy of gods for aye
Rejoicing dominations first next then
Virtues and powers the third The next to whom
Are princedoms and archangels with glad round
To tread their festal ring and last the band
Angelical disporting in their sphere
All as they circle in their orders look
Aloft and downward with such sway prevail
That all with mutual impulse tend to God
These once a mortal view beheld Desire
In Dionysius so intently wrought
That he as I have done rangd them and namd
Their orders marshald in his thought From him
Dissentient one refusd his sacred read
But soon as in this heavn his doubting eyes
Were opend Gregory at his error smild
Nor marvel that a denizen of earth
Should scan such secret truth for he had learnt
Both this and much beside of these our orbs
From an eyewitness to heavns mysteries



CANTO XXIX

No longer than what time Latonas twins
Coverd of Libra and the fleecy star
Together both girding the horizon hang
In even balance from the zenith poisd
Till from that verge each changing hemisphere
Part the nice level een so brief a space
Did Beatrices silence hold A smile
Bat painted on her cheek and her fixd gaze
Bent on the point at which my vision faild
When thus her words resuming she began
I speak nor what thou wouldst inquire demand
For I have markd it where all time and place
Are present Not for increase to himself
Of good which may not be increasd but forth
To manifest his glory by its beams
Inhabiting his own eternity
Beyond times limit or what bound soeer
To circumscribe his being as he willd
Into new natures like unto himself
Eternal Love unfolded Nor before
As if in dull inaction torpid lay
For not in process of before or aft
Upon these waters movd the Spirit of God
Simple and mixd both form and substance forth
To perfect being started like three darts
Shot from a bow threecorded And as ray
In crystal glass and amber shines entire
Een at the moment of its issuing thus
Did from th eternal Sovran beam entire
His threefold operation at one act
Producd coeval Yet in order each
Created his due station knew those highest
Who pure intelligence were made mere power
The lowest in the midst bound with strict league
Intelligence and power unseverd bond
Long tract of ages by the angels past
Ere the creating of another world
Describd on Jeromes pages thou hast seen
But that what I disclose to thee is true
Those penmen whom the Holy Spirit movd
In many a passage of their sacred book
Attest as thou by diligent search shalt find
And reason in some sort discerns the same
Who scarce would grant the heavnly ministers
Of their perfection void so long a space
Thus when and where these spirits of love were made
Thou knowst and how and knowing hast allayd
Thy thirst which from the triple question rose
Ere one had reckond twenty een so soon
Part of the angels fell and in their fall
Confusion to your elements ensued
The others kept their station and this task
Whereon thou lookst began with such delight
That they surcease not ever day nor night
Their circling Of that fatal lapse the cause
Was the curst pride of him whom thou hast seen
Pent with the worlds incumbrance Those whom here
Thou seest were lowly to confess themselves
Of his free bounty who had made them apt
For ministries so high therefore their views
Were by enlightning grace and their own merit
Exalted so that in their will confirmd
They stand nor feel to fall For do not doubt
But to receive the grace which heavn vouchsafes
Is meritorious even as the soul
With prompt affection welcometh the guest
Now without further help if with good heed
My words thy mind have treasurd thou henceforth
This consistory round about mayst scan
And gaze thy fill But since thou hast on earth
Heard vain disputers reasoners in the schools
Canvas the angelic nature and dispute
Its powers of apprehension memory choice
Therefore t is well thou take from me the truth
Pure and without disguise which they below
Equivocating darken and perplex
 Know thou that from the first these substances
Rejoicing in the countenance of God
Have held unceasingly their view intent
Upon the glorious vision from the which
Naught absent is nor hid where then no change
Of newness with succession interrupts
Remembrance there needs none to gather up
Divided thought and images remote
 So that men thus at variance with the truth
Dream though their eyes be open reckless some
Of error others well aware they err
To whom more guilt and shame are justly due
Each the known track of sage philosophy
Deserts and has a byway of his own
So much the restless eagerness to shine
And love of singularity prevail
Yet this offensive as it is provokes
Heavns anger less than when the book of God
Is forcd to yield to mans authority
Or from its straightness warpd no reckning made
What blood the sowing of it in the world
Has cost what favour for himself he wins
Who meekly clings to it The aim of all
Is how to shine een they whose office is
To preach the Gospel let the gospel sleep
And pass their own inventions off instead
One tells how at Christs suffering the wan moon
Bent back her steps and shadowd oer the sun
With intervenient disk as she withdrew
Another how the light shrouded itself
Within its tabernacle and left dark
The Spaniard and the Indian with the Jew
Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears
Bandied about more frequent than the names
Of Bindi and of Lapi in her streets
The sheep meanwhile poor witless ones return
From pasture fed with wind and what avails
For their excuse they do not see their harm
Christ said not to his first conventicle
Go forth and preach impostures to the world
But gave them truth to build on and the sound
Was mighty on their lips nor needed they
Beside the gospel other spear or shield
To aid them in their warfare for the faith
The preacher now provides himself with store
Of jests and gibes and so there be no lack
Of laughter while he vents them his big cowl
Distends and he has won the meed he sought
Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while
Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood
They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said
Which now the dotards hold in such esteem
That every counterfeit who spreads abroad
The hands of holy promise finds a throng
Of credulous fools beneath Saint Anthony
Fattens with this his swine and others worse
Than swine who diet at his lazy board
Paying with unstampd metal for their fare
 But for we far have wanderd let us seek
The forward path again so as the way
Be shortend with the time No mortal tongue
Nor thought of man hath ever reachd so far
That of these natures he might count the tribes
What Daniel of their thousands hath reveald
With finite number infinite conceals
The fountain at whose source these drink their beams
With light supplies them in as many modes
As there are splendours that it shines on each
According to the virtue it conceives
Differing in love and sweet affection
Look then how lofty and how huge in breadth
The eternal might which broken and dispersd
Over such countless mirrors yet remains
Whole in itself and one as at the first



CANTO XXX

Noons fervid hour perchance six thousand miles
From hence is distant and the shadowy cone
Almost to level on our earth declines
When from the midmost of this blue abyss
By turns some star is to our vision lost
And straightway as the handmaid of the sun
Puts forth her radiant brow all light by light
Fade and the spangled firmament shuts in
Een to the loveliest of the glittering throng
Thus vanishd gradually from my sight
The triumph which plays ever round the point
That overcame me seeming for it did
Engirt by that it girdeth Wherefore love
With loss of other object forcd me bend
Mine eyes on Beatrice once again
 If all that hitherto is told of her
Were in one praise concluded t were too weak
To furnish out this turn Mine eyes did look
On beauty such as I believe in sooth
Not merely to exceed our human but
That save its Maker none can to the full
Enjoy it At this point oerpowerd I fail
Unequal to my theme as never bard
Of buskin or of sock hath faild before
For as the sun doth to the feeblest sight
Een so remembrance of that witching smile
Hath dispossess my spirit of itself
Not from that day when on this earth I first
Beheld her charms up to that view of them
Have I with song applausive ever ceasd
To follow but not follow them no more
My course here bounded as each artists is
When it doth touch the limit of his skill
 She such as I bequeath her to the bruit
Of louder trump than mine which hasteneth on
Urging its arduous matter to the close
Her words resumd in gesture and in voice
Resembling one accustomd to command
Forth from the last corporeal are we come
Into the heavn that is unbodied light
Light intellectual replete with love
Love of true happiness replete with joy
Joy that transcends all sweetness of delight
Here shalt thou look on either mighty host
Of Paradise and one in that array
Which in the final judgment thou shalt see
 As when the lightning in a sudden spleen
Unfolded dashes from the blinding eyes
The visive spirits dazzled and bedimmd
So round about me fulminating streams
Of living radiance playd and left me swathd
And veild in dense impenetrable blaze
Such weal is in the love that stills this heavn
For its own flame the torch this fitting ever
 No sooner to my listning ear had come
The brief assurance than I understood
New virtue into me infusd and sight
Kindled afresh with vigour to sustain
Excess of light however pure I lookd
And in the likeness of a river saw
Light flowing from whose amberseeming waves
Flashd up effulgence as they glided on
Twixt banks on either side painted with spring
Incredible how fair and from the tide
There ever and anon outstarting flew
Sparkles instinct with life and in the flowrs
Did set them like to rubies chasd in gold
Then as if drunk with odors plungd again
Into the wondrous flood from which as one
Reenterd still another rose The thirst
Of knowledge high whereby thou art inflamd
To search the meaning of what here thou seest
The more it warms thee pleases me the more
But first behooves thee of this water drink
Or ere that longing be allayd So spake
The daystar of mine eyes then thus subjoind
This stream and these forth issuing from its gulf
And diving back a living topaz each
With all this laughter on its bloomy shores
Are but a preface shadowy of the truth
They emblem not that in themselves the things
Are crude but on thy part is the defect
For that thy views not yet aspire so high
Never did babe that had outslept his wont
Rush with such eager straining to the milk
As I toward the water bending me
To make the better mirrors of mine eyes
In the refining wave and as the eaves
Of mine eyelids did drink of it forthwith
Seemd it unto me turnd from length to round
Then as a troop of maskers when they put
Their vizors off look other than before
The counterfeited semblance thrown aside
So into greater jubilee were changd
Those flowers and sparkles and distinct I saw
Before me either court of heavn displacd
 O prime enlightener thou who cravst me strength
On the high triumph of thy realm to gaze
Grant virtue now to utter what I kennd
 There is in heavn a light whose goodly shine
Makes the Creator visible to all
Created that in seeing him alone
Have peace and in a circle spreads so far
That the circumference were too loose a zone
To girdle in the sun All is one beam
Reflected from the summit of the first
That moves which being hence and vigour takes
And as some cliff that from the bottom eyes
Its image mirrord in the crystal flood
As if t admire its brave appareling
Of verdure and of flowers so round about
Eyeing the light on more than million thrones
Stood eminent whatever from our earth
Has to the skies returnd How wide the leaves
Extended to their utmost of this rose
Whose lowest step embosoms such a space
Of ample radiance Yet nor amplitude
Nor height impeded but my view with ease
Took in the full dimensions of that joy
Near or remote what there avails where God
Immediate rules and Nature awed suspends
Her sway Into the yellow of the rose
Perennial which in bright expansiveness
Lays forth its gradual blooming redolent
Of praises to the neverwintring sun
As one who fain would speak yet holds his peace
Beatrice led me and Behold she said
This fair assemblage stoles of snowy white
How numberless The city where we dwell
Behold how vast and these our seats so throngd
Few now are wanting here In that proud stall
On which the crown already oer its state
Suspended holds thine eyesor ere thyself
Mayst at the wedding supshall rest the soul
Of the great Harry he who by the world
Augustas haild to Italy must come
Before her day be ripe But ye are sick
And in your tetchy wantonness as blind
As is the bantling that of hunger dies
And drives away the nurse Nor may it be
That he who in the sacred forum sways
Openly or in secret shall with him
Accordant walk Whom God will not endure
I th holy office long but thrust him down
To Simon Magus where Magnas priest
Will sink beneath him such will be his meed



CANTO XXXI

In fashion as a snowwhite rose lay then
Before my view the saintly multitude
Which in his own blood Christ espousd Meanwhile
That other host that soar aloft to gaze
And celebrate his glory whom they love
Hoverd around and like a troop of bees
Amid the vernal sweets alighting now
Now clustering where their fragrant labour glows
Flew downward to the mighty flowr or rose
From the redundant petals streaming back
Unto the steadfast dwelling of their joy
Faces had they of flame and wings of gold
The rest was whiter than the driven snow
And as they flitted down into the flower
From range to range fanning their plumy loins
Whisperd the peace and ardour which they won
From that soft winnowing Shadow none the vast
Interposition of such numerous flight
Cast from above upon the flower or view
Obstructed aught For through the universe
Wherever merited celestial light
Glides freely and no obstacle prevents
 All there who reign in safety and in bliss
Ages long past or new on one sole mark
Their love and vision fixd O trinal beam
Of individual star that charmst them thus
Vouchsafe one glance to gild our storm below
 If the grim brood from Arctic shores that roamd
Where helice forever as she wheels
Sparkles a mothers fondness on her son
Stood in mute wonder mid the works of Rome
When to their view the Lateran arose
In greatness more than earthly I who then
From human to divine had past from time
Unto eternity and out of Florence
To justice and to truth how might I choose
But marvel too Twixt gladness and amaze
In sooth no will had I to utter aught
Or hear And as a pilgrim when he rests
Within the temple of his vow looks round
In breathless awe and hopes some time to tell
Of all its goodly state een so mine eyes
Coursd up and down along the living light
Now low and now aloft and now around
Visiting every step Looks I beheld
Where charity in soft persuasion sat
Smiles from within and radiance from above
And in each gesture grace and honour high
 So rovd my ken and its general form
All Paradise surveyd when round I turnd
With purpose of my lady to inquire
Once more of things that held my thought suspense
But answer found from other than I weend
For Beatrice when I thought to see
I saw instead a senior at my side
 Robd as the rest in glory Joy benign
Glowd in his eye and oer his cheek diffusd
With gestures such as spake a fathers love
And Whither is she vanishd straight I askd
 By Beatrice summond he replied
I come to aid thy wish Looking aloft
To the third circle from the highest there
Behold her on the throne wherein her merit
Hath placd her Answering not mine eyes I raisd
And saw her where aloof she sat her brow
A wreath reflecting of eternal beams
Not from the centre of the sea so far
Unto the region of the highest thunder
As was my ken from hers and yet the form
Came through that medium down unmixd and pure
 O Lady thou in whom my hopes have rest
Who for my safety hast not scornd in hell
To leave the traces of thy footsteps markd
For all mine eyes have seen I to thy power
And goodness virtue owe and grace Of slave
Thou hast to freedom brought me and no means
For my deliverance apt hast left untried
Thy liberal bounty still toward me keep
That when my spirit which thou madest whole
Is loosend from this body it may find
Favour with thee So I my suit preferrd
And she so distant as appeard lookd down
And smild then towrds th eternal fountain turnd
 And thus the senior holy and reverd
That thou at length mayst happily conclude
Thy voyage to which end I was dispatchd
By supplication movd and holy love
Let thy upsoaring vision range at large
This garden through for so by ray divine
Kindled thy ken a higher flight shall mount
And from heavns queen whom fervent I adore
All gracious aid befriend us for that I
Am her own faithful Bernard Like a wight
Who haply from Croatia wends to see
Our Veronica and the while t is shown
Hangs over it with neversated gaze
And all that he hath heard revolving saith
Unto himself in thought And didst thou look
Een thus O Jesus my true Lord and God
And was this semblance thine So gazd I then
Adoring for the charity of him
Who musing in the world that peace enjoyd
Stood lively before me Child of grace
Thus he began thou shalt not knowledge gain
Of this glad being if thine eyes are held
Still in this depth below But search around
The circles to the furthest till thou spy
Seated in state the queen that of this realm
Is sovran Straight mine eyes I raisd and bright
As at the birth of morn the eastern clime
Above th horizon where the sun declines
To mine eyes that upward as from vale
To mountain sped at th extreme bound a part
Excelld in lustre all the front opposd
And as the glow burns ruddiest oer the wave
That waits the sloping beam which Phaeton
Ill knew to guide and on each part the light
Diminishd fades intensest in the midst
So burnd the peaceful oriflamb and slackd
On every side the living flame decayd
And in that midst their sportive pennons wavd
Thousands of angels in resplendence each
Distinct and quaint adornment At their glee
And carol smild the Lovely One of heavn
That joy was in the eyes of all the blest
 Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich
As is the colouring in fancys loom
T were all too poor to utter the least part
Of that enchantment When he saw mine eyes
Intent on her that charmd him Bernard gazd
With so exceeding fondness as infusd
Ardour into my breast unfelt before



CANTO XXXII

Freely the sage though wrapt in musings high
Assumd the teachers part and mild began
The wound that Mary closd she opend first
Who sits so beautiful at Marys feet
The third in order underneath her lo
Rachel with Beatrice Sarah next
Judith Rebecca and the gleaner maid
Meek ancestress of him who sang the songs
Of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood
All as I name them down from deaf to leaf
Are in gradation throned on the rose
And from the seventh step successively
Adown the breathing tresses of the flowr
Still doth the file of Hebrew dames proceed
For these are a partition wall whereby
The sacred stairs are severd as the faith
In Christ divides them On this part where blooms
Each leaf in full maturity are set
Such as in Christ or ere he came believd
On th other where an intersected space
Yet shows the semicircle void abide
All they who lookd to Christ already come
And as our Lady on her glorious stool
And they who on their stools beneath her sit
This way distinction make een so on his
The mighty Baptist that way marks the line
He who endurd the desert and the pains
Of martyrdom and for two years of hell
Yet still continued holy and beneath
Augustin Francis Benedict and the rest
Thus far from round to round So heavns decree
Forecasts this garden equally to fill
With faith in either view past or to come
Learn too that downward from the step which cleaves
Midway the twain compartments none there are
Who place obtain for merit of their own
But have through others merit been advancd
On set conditions spirits all releasd
Ere for themselves they had the power to choose
And if thou mark and listen to them well
Their childish looks and voice declare as much
 Here silent as thou art I know thy doubt
And gladly will I loose the knot wherein
Thy subtle thoughts have bound thee From this realm
Excluded chalice no entrance here may find
No more shall hunger thirst or sorrow can
A law immutable hath establishd all
Nor is there aught thou seest that doth not fit
Exactly as the finger to the ring
It is not therefore without cause that these
Oerspeedy comers to immortal life
Are different in their shares of excellence
Our Sovran Lordthat settleth this estate
In love and in delight so absolute
That wish can dare no furtherevery soul
Created in his joyous sight to dwell
With grace at pleasure variously endows
And for a proof th effect may well suffice
And t is moreover most expressly markd
In holy scripture where the twins are said
To have struggled in the womb Therefore as grace
Inweaves the coronet so every brow
Weareth its proper hue of orient light
And merely in respect to his prime gift
Not in reward of meritorious deed
Hath each his several degree assignd
In early times with their own innocence
More was not wanting than the parents faith
To save them those first ages past behoovd
That circumcision in the males should imp
The flight of innocent wings but since the day
Of grace hath come without baptismal rites
In Christ accomplishd innocence herself
Must linger yet below Now raise thy view
Unto the visage most resembling Christ
For in her splendour only shalt thou win
The powr to look on him Forthwith I saw
Such floods of gladness on her visage showerd
From holy spirits winging that profound
That whatsoever I had yet beheld
Had not so much suspended me with wonder
Or shown me such similitude of God
And he who had to her descended once
On earth now haild in heavn and on poisd wing
Ave Maria Gratia Plena sang
To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court
From all parts answring rang that holier joy
Brooded the deep serene Father reverd
Who deignst for me to quit the pleasant place
Wherein thou sittest by eternal lot
Say who that angel is that with such glee
Beholds our queen and so enamourd glows
Of her high beauty that all fire he seems
So I again resorted to the lore
Of my wise teacher he whom Marys charms
Embellishd as the sun the morning star
Who thus in answer spake In him are summd
Whatever of buxomness and free delight
May be in Spirit or in angel met
And so beseems for that he bare the palm
Down unto Mary when the Son of God
Vouchsafd to clothe him in terrestrial weeds
Now let thine eyes wait heedful on my words
And note thou of this just and pious realm
The chiefest nobles Those highest in bliss
The twain on each hand next our empress thrond
Are as it were two roots unto this rose
He to the left the parent whose rash taste
Proves bitter to his seed and on the right
That ancient father of the holy church
Into whose keeping Christ did give the keys
Of this sweet flowr near whom behold the seer
That ere he died saw all the grievous times
Of the fair bride who with the lance and nails
Was won And near unto the other rests
The leader under whom on manna fed
Th ungrateful nation fickle and perverse
On th other part facing to Peter lo
Where Anna sits so well content to look
On her lovd daughter that with moveless eye
She chants the loud hosanna while opposd
To the first father of your mortal kind
Is Lucia at whose hest thy lady sped
When on the edge of ruin closd thine eye
 But for the vision hasteneth so an end
Here break we off as the good workman doth
That shapes the cloak according to the cloth
And to the primal love our ken shall rise
That thou mayst penetrate the brightness far
As sight can bear thee Yet alas in sooth
Beating thy pennons thinking to advance
Thou backward fallst Grace then must first be gaind
Her grace whose might can help thee Thou in prayer
Seek her and with affection whilst I sue
Attend and yield me all thy heart He said
And thus the saintly orison began



CANTO XXXIII

O virgin mother daughter of thy Son
Created beings all in lowliness
Surpassing as in height above them all
Term by th eternal counsel preordaind
Ennobler of thy nature so advancd
In thee that its great Maker did not scorn
Himself in his own work enclosd to dwell
For in thy womb rekindling shone the love
Reveald whose genial influence makes now
This flower to germin in eternal peace
Here thou to us of charity and love
Art as the noonday torch and art beneath
To mortal men of hope a living spring
So mighty art thou lady and so great
That he who grace desireth and comes not
To thee for aidance fain would have desire
Fly without wings Nor only him who asks
Thy bounty succours but doth freely oft
Forerun the asking Whatsoeer may be
Of excellence in creature pity mild
Relenting mercy large munificence
Are all combind in thee Here kneeleth one
Who of all spirits hath reviewd the state
From the worlds lowest gap unto this height
Suppliant to thee he kneels imploring grace
For virtue yet more high to lift his ken
Toward the bliss supreme And I who neer
Coveted sight more fondly for myself
Than now for him my prayers to thee prefer
And pray they be not scant that thou wouldst drive
Each cloud of his mortality away
That on the sovran pleasure he may gaze
This also I entreat of thee O queen
Who canst do what thou wilt that in him thou
Wouldst after all he hath beheld preserve
Affection sound and human passions quell
Lo Where with Beatrice many a saint
Stretch their claspd hands in furtherance of my suit
 The eyes that heavn with love and awe regards
Fixd on the suitor witnessd how benign
She looks on pious prayrs then fastend they
On th everlasting light wherein no eye
Of creature as may well be thought so far
Can travel inward I meanwhile who drew
Near to the limit where all wishes end
The ardour of my wish for so behooved
Ended within me Beckning smild the sage
That I should look aloft but ere he bade
Already of myself aloft I lookd
For visual strength refining more and more
Bare me into the ray authentical
Of sovran light Thenceforward what I saw
Was not for words to speak nor memorys self
To stand against such outrage on her skill
As one who from a dream awakend straight
All he hath seen forgets yet still retains
Impression of the feeling in his dream
Een such am I for all the vision dies
As t were away and yet the sense of sweet
That sprang from it still trickles in my heart
Thus in the sunthaw is the snow unseald
Thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost
The Sybils sentence O eternal beam
Whose height what reach of mortal thought may soar
Yield me again some little particle
Of what thou then appearedst give my tongue
Power but to leave one sparkle of thy glory
Unto the race to come that shall not lose
Thy triumph wholly if thou waken aught
Of memory in me and endure to hear
The record sound in this unequal strain
 Such keenness from the living ray I met
That if mine eyes had turnd away methinks
I had been lost but so emboldend on
I passd as I remember till my view
Hoverd the brink of dread infinitude
 O grace unenvying of thy boon that gavst
Boldness to fix so earnestly my ken
On th everlasting splendour that I lookd
While sight was unconsumd and in that depth
Saw in one volume claspd of love whatever
The universe unfolds all properties
Of substance and of accident beheld
Compounded yet one individual light
The whole And of such bond methinks I saw
The universal form for that whenever
I do but speak of it my soul dilates
Beyond her proper self and till I speak
One moment seems a longer lethargy
Than fiveandtwenty ages had appeard
To that emprize that first made Neptune wonder
At Argos shadow darkening on his flood
 With fixed heed suspense and motionless
Wondring I gazd and admiration still
Was kindled as I gazd It may not be
That one who looks upon that light can turn
To other object willingly his view
For all the good that will may covet there
Is summd and all elsewhere defective found
Complete My tongue shall utter now no more
Een what remembrance keeps than could the babes
That yet is moistend at his mothers breast
Not that the semblance of the living light
Was changd that ever as at first remaind
But that my vision quickening in that sole
Appearance still new miracles descryd
And toild me with the change In that abyss
Of radiance clear and lofty seemd methought
Three orbs of triple hue clipt in one bound
And from another one reflected seemd
As rainbow is from rainbow and the third
Seemd fire breathd equally from both Oh speech
How feeble and how faint art thou to give
Conception birth Yet this to what I saw
Is less than little Oh eternal light
Sole in thyself that dwellst and of thyself
Sole understood past present or to come
Thou smiledst on that circling which in thee
Seemd as reflected splendour while I musd
For I therein methought in its own hue
Beheld our image painted steadfastly
I therefore pord upon the view As one
Who versd in geometric lore would fain
Measure the circle and though pondering long
And deeply that beginning which he needs
Finds not een such was I intent to scan
The novel wonder and trace out the form
How to the circle fitted and therein
How placd but the flight was not for my wing
Had not a flash darted athwart my mind
And in the spleen unfolded what it sought
 Here vigour faild the towring fantasy
But yet the will rolld onward like a wheel
In even motion by the Love impelld
That moves the sun in heavn and all the stars

being taken by force out of a monastery where she had professed
was married to the Emperor Henry Vl and by him was mother to

because it was not credited that she could have a child at that
age she was delivered in a pavilion and it was given out that
any lady who pleased was at liberty to see her Many came and
saw her and the suspicion ceased Ricordano Malaspina in
Muratori Rer It Script t viii p 939 and G Villani in

The French translator above mentored speaks of her having
poisoned her husband The death of Henry Vl is recorded in the
Chronicon Siciliae by an anonymous writer Muratori t x but
not a word of his having been poisoned by Constance and
Ricordano Malaspina even mentions her decease as happening before
that of her husband Henry V for so this author with some
others terms him v 122 The second Henry Vl son of
Frederick I was the second emperor of the house of Saab and his

explained by the Poet himself
v 98 Charlemagne Dante could not be ignorant that the reign
of Justinian was long prior to that of Charlemagne but the
spirit of the former emperor is represented both in this
instance and in what follows as conscious of the events that had
taken place after his own time

v 104 The yellow lilies The French ensign

v 110 Charles The commentators explain this to mean Charles
II king of Naples and Sicily Is it not more likely to allude to
Charles of Valois son of Philip III of France who was sent for
about this time into Italy by Pope Boniface with the promise of
being made emperor See G Villani 1 viii c 42

v 131 Romeos light The story of Romeo is involved in some
uncertainty The French writers assert the continuance of his
ministerial office even after the decease of his soverign
Raymond Berenger count of Provence and they rest this assertion
chiefly on the fact of a certain Romieu de Villeneuve who was
the contemporary of that prince having left large possessions
behind him as appears by his will preserved in the archives of
the bishopric of Venice There might however have been more than
one person of the name of Romieu or Romeo which answers to that
of Palmer in our language Nor is it probable that the Italians
who lived so near the time were misinformed in an occurrence of
such notoriety According to them after he had long been a
faithful steward to Raymond when an account was required from
him of the revenues whichhe had carefully husbanded and his
master as lavishly disbursed He demanded the little mule the
staff and the scrip with which he had first entered into the
counts service a stranger pilgrim from the shrine of St James
in Galicia and parted as he came nor was it ever known whence
he was or wither he went G Villani 1 vi c 92

Berenger Margaret the eldest was married to Louis IX of

the Poets reasoning when he observes Wretched for us if we
had not arguments more convincing and of a higher kind to
assure us of the truth of our resurrection It is here
intended I think that the whole of Gods dispensations to man
should be considered as a proof of our resurrection The
conclusion is that as before sin man was immortal
so being restored to the favor of heaven by the expiation made
for sin he necessarily recovers his claim to immortality

There is much in this poem to justify the encomium which the
learned Salvini has passed on it when in an epistle to Redi
imitating what Horace had said of Homer that the duties of life
might be better learnt from the Grecian bard than from the
teachers of the porch or the academy he says

And dost thou ask what themes my mind engage
The lonely hours I give to Dantes page
And meet more sacred learning in his lines
Than I had gaind from all the school divines

Se volete saper la vita mia
Studiando io sto lungi da tutti gli nomini
Ed ho irnparato piu teologia
In questi giorni che ho riletto Dante
Che nelle scuole fattto io non avria

it in which the equinoctial circle and the Zodiac intersect
each other where the common motion of the heavens from east to

the strongest because the velocity of each is increased to the

the bishopric of Ratisbon and in two years after resigned it
and returned to his cell in Cologne where the remainder of his
life was passed in superintending the school and in composing
his voluminous works on divinity and natural science He died in

suppose that our Poet here augurs that great reform which he
vainly hoped would follow on the arrival of the Emperor Henry

finished till after the death of Henry as appears from the
mention that is made of John XXII it cannot be denied but the
conjecture is probable

v 43 Such diffrence The material world and the
intelligential the copy and the pattern appear to Dante to
differ in this respect that the orbits of the latter are more
swift the nearer they are to the centre whereas the contrary is
the case with the orbits of the former The seeming contradiction
is thus accounted for by Beatrice In the material world the
more ample the body is the greater is the good of which itis
capable supposing all the parts to be equally perfect But in the
intelligential world the circles are more excellent and
powerful the more they approximate to the central point which
is God Thus the first circle that of the seraphim corresponds
to the ninth sphere or primum mobile the second that of the
cherubim to the eighth sphere or heaven of fixed stars the
third or circle of thrones to the seventh sphere or planet of
Saturn and in like manner throughout the two other trines of

PREFACE

In the years 1805 and 1806 I published the first part of the
following translation with the text of the original Since that
period two impressions of the whole of the Divina Commedia in
Italian have made their appearance in this country It is not
necessary that I should add a third and I am induced to hope
that the Poem even in the present version of it may not be
without interest for the mere English reader

The translation of the second and third parts The Purgatory
and The Paradise was begun long before the first and as early
as the year 1797 but owing to many interruptions not concluded
till the summer before last On a retrospect of the time and
exertions that have been thus employed I do not regard those
hours as the least happy of my life during which to use the
eloquent language of Mr Coleridge my individual recollections
have been suspended and lulled to sleep amid the music of nobler
thoughts nor that study as misapplied which has familiarized
me with one of the sublimest efforts of the human invention

To those who shall be at the trouble of examining into the
degree of accuracy with which the task has been executed I may
be allowed to suggest that their judgment should not be formed
on a comparison with any single text of my Author since in more
instances than I have noticed I have had to make my choice out
of a variety of readings and interpretations presented by
different editions and commentators

In one or two of those editions is to be found the title of The
Vision which I have adopted as more conformable to the genius
of our language than that of The Divine Comedy Dante himself
I believe termed it simply The Comedy in the first place
because the style was of the middle kind and in the next
because the story if story it may be called ends happily

Instead of a Life of my Author I have subjoined in
chronological order a view not only of the principal events
which befell him but of the chief public occurrences that
happened in his time concerning both of which the reader may
obtain further information by turning to the passages referred
to in the Poem and Notes

January 1814
