WILLIAM

William Sylvanus Baxter paused for a moment of thought in front of the
drugstore at the corner of Washington Street and Central Avenue He had
an internal question to settle before he entered the store he wished
to allow the young man at the sodafountain no excuse for saying Well
make up your mind what its goin to be cant you Rudeness of this
kind especially in the presence of girls and women was hard to bear
and though William Sylvanus Baxter had borne it upon occasion he
had reached an age when he found it intolerable Therefore to avoid
offering opportunity for anything of the kind he decided upon chocolate
and strawberry mixed before approaching the fountain Once there
however and a large glass of these flavors and diluted icecream
proving merely provocative he said languidlyan affectation for he
could have disposed of half a dozen with gusto Well now Im here I
might as well go one more Fill er up again Same

Emerging to the street penniless he bent a fascinated and dramatic
gaze upon his reflection in the drugstore window and then as he
turned his back upon the alluring image his expression altered to
one of lofty and uncondescending amusement That was his glance at the
passing public From the heights he seemed to bestow upon the world
a mysterious derisionfor William Sylvanus Baxter was seventeen long
years of age and had learned to present the appearance of one who
possesses inside information about life and knows all strangers and most
acquaintances to be of inferior caste costume and intelligence

He lingered upon the corner awhile not pressed for time Indeed he
found many hours of these summer months heavy upon his hands for he had
no important occupation unless some intermittent dalliance with a
work on geometry anticipatory of the distant autumn might be thought
important which is doubtful since he usually went to sleep on the
shady side porch at his home with the book in his hand So having
nothing to call him elsewhere he lounged before the drugstore in the
early afternoon sunshine watching the passing to and fro of the lower
orders and bourgeoisie of the middlesized midland city which claimed
him so to speak for a native son

Apparently quite unembarrassed by his presence they went about their
business and the only people who looked at him with any attention were
pedestrians of color It is true that when the gaze of these fell upon
him it was instantly arrested for no colored person could have passed
him without a little pang of pleasure and of longing Indeed the
tropical violence of William Sylvanus Baxters tie and the strange
brilliancy of his hat might have made it positively unsafe for him to
walk at night through the negro quarter of the town And though no man
could have sworn to the color of that hat whether it was blue or green
yet its color was a saner thing than its shape which was blurred
tortured and raffish it might have been the miniature model of a
volcano that had blown off its cone and misbehaved disastrously on its
lower slopes as well He had the air of wearing it as a matter of course
and with careless ease but that was only an airit was the apple of
his eye

For the rest his costume was neutral subordinate and even a little
neglected in the matter of a detail or two one pointed flap of his soft
collar was held down by a button but the other showed a frayed thread
where the button once had been his low patentleather shoes were of a
luster not solicitously cherished and there could be no doubt that he
needed to get his hair cut while something might have been done too
about the individualized hirsute prophecies which had made independent
appearances here and there upon his chin He examined these from time
to time by the sense of touch passing his hand across his face and
allowing his fingertips a slight tapping motion wherever they detected
a prophecy

Thus he fell into a pleasant musing and seemed to forget the crowded
street




II

THE UNKNOWN

He was roused by the bluff greeting of an acquaintance not dissimilar to
himself in age manner and apparel

Hlo Silly Bill said this person halting beside William Sylvanus
Baxter Whats the news

William showed no enthusiasm on the contrary a frown of annoyance
appeared upon his brow The nickname Silly Billlong ago compounded
by merry childcomrades from William and Sylvanuswas not to his
taste especially in public where he preferred to be addressed simply
and manfully as Baxter Any direct expression of resentment however
was difficult since it was plain that Johnnie Watson intended no
offense whatever and but spoke out of custom

Dont know any William replied coldly

Dull times aint it said Mr Watson a little depressed by his
friends manner I heard May Parcher was comin back to town yesterday
though

Well let her returned William still severe

They said she was goin to bring a girl to visit her Johnnie began in
a confidential tone They said she was a reglar ringdinger and

Well what if she is the discouraging Mr Baxter interrupted Makes
little difference to ME I guess

Oh no it dont YOU dont take any interest in girls OH no

No I do not was the emphatic and heartless retort I never saw one
in my life Id care whether she lived or died

Honest asked Johnnie struck by the conviction with which this speech
was uttered Honest is that so

Yes honest William replied sharply They could ALL die _I_
wouldnt notice

Johnnie Watson was profoundly impressed Why _I_ didnt know you felt
that way about em Silly Bill I always thought you were kind of

Well I do feel that way about em said William Sylvanus Baxter and
outraged by the repetition of the offensive nickname he began to move
away You can tell em so for me if you want to he added over his
shoulder And he walked haughtily up the street leaving Mr Watson to
ponder upon this case of misogyny never until that moment suspected

It was beyond the power of his mind to grasp the fact that William
Sylvanus Baxters cruel words about girls had been uttered because
William was annoyed at being called Silly Bill in a public place and
had not known how to object otherwise than by showing contempt for any
topic of conversation proposed by the offender This latter being of
a disposition to accept statements as facts was warmly interested
instead of being hurt and decided that here was something worth talking
about especially with representatives of the class so sweepingly
excluded from the sympathies of Silly Bill

William meanwhile made his way toward the residence section of the
town and presentlywith the passage of time found himself eased of his
annoyance He walked in his own manner using his shoulders to emphasize
an effect of carelessness which he wished to produce upon observers For
his consciousness of observers was abnormal since he had it whether any
one was looking at him or not and it reached a crucial stage whenever
he perceived persons of his own age but of opposite sex approaching

A person of this description was encountered upon the sidewalk within a
hundred yards of his own home and William Sylvanus Baxter saw her while
yet she was afar off The quiet and shady thoroughfare was empty of all
human life at the time save for those two and she was upon the same
side of the street that he was thus it became inevitable that they
should meet face to face for the first time in their lives He
had perceived even in the distance that she was unknown to him a
stranger because he knew all the girls in this part of the town who
dressed as famously in the mode as that And then as the distance
between them lessened he saw that she was ravishingly pretty far far
prettier indeed than any girl he knew At least it seemed so for it
is unfortunately much easier for strangers to be beautiful Aside
from this advantage of mystery the approaching vision was piquant and
graceful enough to have reminded a much older boy of a spotless white
kitten for in spite of a charmingly managed demureness there was
precisely that kind of playfulness somewhere expressed about her Just
now it was most definite in the look she bent upon the light and fluffy
burden which she carried nestled in the inner curve of her right arm
a tiny dog with hair like cotton and a pink ribbon round his neckan
animal sated with indulgence and idiotically unaware of his privilege
He was half asleep

William did not see the dog or it is the plain anatomical truth
that when he saw how pretty the girl was his hearthis physical
heartbegan to do things the like of which experienced by an elderly
person would have brought the doctor in haste In addition his
complexion alteredhe broke out in fiery patches He suffered from
breathlessness and from pressure on the diaphragm

Afterward he could not have named the color of the little parasol she
carried in her left hand and yet as it drew nearer and nearer a rosy
haze suffused the neighborhood and the whole world began to turn an
exquisite pink Beneath this gentle glow with eyes downcast in thought
she apparently took no note of William even when she and William had
come within a few yards of each other Yet he knew that she would look
up and that their eyes must meeta thing for which he endeavored to
prepare himself by a strange weaving motion of his neck against the
friction of his collarfor thus instinctively he strove to obtain
greater ease and some decent appearance of manly indifference He felt
that his efforts were a failure that his agitation was ruinous and
must be perceptible at a distance of miles not feet And then in
the instant of panic that befell when her darklashed eyelids slowly
lifted he had a flash of inspiration

He opened his mouth somewhat and as her eyes met his full and
startlingly he placed three fingers across the orifice and also
offered a slight vocal proof that she had surprised him in the midst of
a yawn

Oh hum he said

For the fraction of a second the deep blue spark in her eyes glowed
brightergentle arrows of turquoise shot him through and throughand
then her glance withdrew from the ineffable collision Her small
whiteshod feet continued to bear her onward away from him while
his own dimmed shoes peregrinated in the opposite directionWilliam
necessarily yet with excruciating reluctance accompanying them But
just at the moment when he and the lovely creature were side by side
and her head turned from him she spoke that is she murmured but he
caught the words

You Flopit wake up she said in the tone of a mother talking
babytalk SO indifferink

Williams feet and his breath halted spasmodically For an instant he
thought she had spoken to him and then for the first time he perceived
the fluffy head of the dog bobbing languidly over her arm with the
motion of her walking and he comprehended that Flopit and not William
Sylvanus Baxter was the gentleman addressed Butbut had she MEANT
him

His breath returning though not yet operating in its usual manner
he stood gazing after her while the glamorous parasol passed down the
shady street catching splashes of sunshine through the branches of
the mapletrees and the cottony head of the tiny dog continued to be
visible bobbing rhythmically over a filmy sleeve Had she meant that
William was indifferent Was it William that she really addressed

He took two steps to follow her but a suffocating shyness stopped him
abruptly and in a horror lest she should glance round and detect him
in the act he turned and strode fiercely to the gate of his own home
before he dared to look again And when he did look affecting great
casualness in the action she was gone evidently having turned the
corner Yet the street did not seem quite empty there was still
something warm and fragrant about it and a rosy glamor lingered in
the air William rested an elbow upon the gatepost and with his chin
reposing in his hand gazed long in the direction in which the unknown
had vanished And his soul was tremulous for she had done her work but
too well

Indifferink he murmured thrilling at his own exceedingly
indifferent imitation of her voice Indifferink that was just what he
would have her thinkthat he was a cold indifferent man It was what
he wished all girls to think And sarcastic He had been envious one
day when May Parcher said that Joe Bullitt was awfully sarcastic
William had spent the ensuing hour in an objectlesson intended to make
Miss Parcher see that William Sylvanus Baxter was twice as sarcastic
as Joe Bullitt ever thought of being but this great effort had been
unsuccessful because William failed to understand that Miss Parcher
had only been sending a sort of message to Mr Bullitt It was a device
not unique among her sex her hope was that William would repeat her
remark in such a manner that Joe Bullitt would hear it and call to
inquire what she meant

SO indifferink murmured William leaning dreamily upon the
gatepost Indifferink He tried to get the exact cooing quality of
the unknowns voice Indifferink And repeating the honeyed word so
entrancingly distorted he fell into a kind of stupor vague beautiful
pictures rising before him the one least blurred being of himself on
horseback sweeping between Flopit and a racing automobile And
then having restored the little animal to its mistress William
sat carelessly in the saddle he had the Guardsmans seat while the
perfectly trained steed wheeled about forelegs in the air preparing
to go But shall I not see you again to thank you more properly she
cried pleading Some other dayperhaps he answered

And left her in a cloud of dust




III

THE PAINFUL AGE

OH WILLEE

Thus a shrill voice to his ears hideously different from that other
interrupted and dispersed his visions Little Jane his tenyearold
sister stood upon the front porch the door open behind her and in her
hand she held a large slab of breadandbutter covered with apple sauce
and powdered sugar Evidence that she had sampled this compound was upon
her cheeks and to her brother she was a repulsive sight

Willee she shrilled Look GOOD And to emphasize the adjective
she indelicately patted the region of her body in which she believed
her stomach to be located Theres a slice for you on the diningroom
table she informed him joyously

Outraged he entered the house without a word to her and proceeding
to the diningroom laid hands upon the slice she had mentioned but
declined to eat it in Janes company He was in an exalted mood and
though in no condition of mind or body would he refuse food of almost
any kind Jane was an intrusion he could not suffer at this time

He carried the refection to his own room and locking the door sat down
to eat while even as he ate the spell that was upon him deepened in
intensity

Oh eyes he whispered softly in that cool privacy and shelter from
the world Oh eyes of blue

The mirror of a dressingtable sent him the reflection of his own eyes
which also were blue and he gazed upon them and upon the rest of his
image the while he ate his breadandbutter and apple sauce and sugar
Thus watching himself eat he continued to stare dreamily at the mirror
until the breadandbutter and apple sauce and sugar had disappeared
whereupon he rose and approached the dressingtable to study himself at
greater advantage

He assumed as repulsive an expression as he could command at the same
time making the kingly gesture of one who repels unwelcome attentions
and it is beyond doubt that he was thus acting a little scene of
indifference Other symbolic dramas followed though an invisible
observer might have been puzzled for a key to some of them One
however would have proved easily intelligible his expression having
altered to a look of pity and contrition he turned from the mirror
and walking slowly to a chair across the room used his right hand in
a peculiar manner seeming to stroke the air at a point about ten inches
above the back of the chair There there little girl he said in a
low gentle voice I didnt know you cared

Then with a rather abrupt dismissal of this theme he returned to the
mirror and after a questioning scrutiny nodded solemnly forming with
his lips the words The real thingthe real thing at last He
meant that after many imitations had imposed upon him Lovethe real
thinghad come to him in the end And as he turned away he murmured
And even her nameunknown

This evidently was a thought that continued to occupy him for he walked
up and down the room frowning but suddenly his brow cleared and his
eye lit with purpose Seating himself at a small writingtable by
the window he proceeded to express his personalitythough with
considerable laborin something which he did not doubt to be a poem

Threequarters of an hour having sufficed for its completion including
rewriting and polish he solemnly signed it and then read it several
times in a state of hushed astonishment He had never dreamed that he
could do anything like this

 MILADY
 I do not know her name
 Though it would be the same
 Where roses bloom at twilight
 And the lark takes his flight
 It would be the same anywhere
 Where music sounds in air
 I was never introduced to the lady
 So I could not call her Lass or Sadie
 So I will call her Milady
 By the sands of the sea
 She always will be
 Just Mlady to me
 WILLIAM SYLVANUS BAXTER Esq July 14

It is impossible to say how many times he might have read the poem over
always with increasing amazement at his newfound powers had he not
been interrupted by the odious voice of Jane

Willee

To William in his high and lonely mood this piercing summons brought
an actual shudder and the very thought of Jane with tokens of apple
sauce and sugar still upon her cheek probably seemed a kind of
sacrilege He fiercely swore his favorite oath acquired from the hero
of a work of fiction he admired Ye gods and concealed his poem in
the drawer of the writingtable for Janes footsteps were approaching
his door

Willee Mamma wants you She tried the handle of the door

Gway he said

Willee Jane hammered upon the door with her fist Willee

What you want he shouted

Jane explained certain pauses indicating that her attention was
partially diverted to another slice of breadandbutter and apple sauce
and sugar Willee mamma wants youwants you to go help Genesis
bring some washtubs home and a tin cloesboilerfrom the secondhand
mans store

WHAT

Jane repeated the outrageous message adding She wants you to
hurryand I got some more breadandbutter and apple sauce and sugar
for comin to tell you

William left no doubt in Janes mind about his attitude in reference
to the whole matter His refusal was direct and infuriated but in the
midst of a multitude of plain statements which he was making there
was a decisive tapping upon the door at a point higher than Jane could
reach and his mothers voice interrupted

Hush Willie Open the door please

He obeyed furiously and Mrs Baxter walked in with a deprecating air
while Jane followed so profoundly interested that until almost the
close of the interview she held her breadandbutter and apple sauce
and sugar at a sort of waystation on its journey to her mouth

Thats a nice thing to ask me to do stormed the unfortunate William
Ye gods Do you think Joe Bullitts mother would dare to

Wait dearie Mrs Baxter begged pacifically I just want to
explain

Explain Ye gods

Now now just a minute Willie she said What I wanted to explain
was why its necessary for you to go with Genesis for the

Never he shouted Never You expect me to walk through the public
streets with that awfullookin old nigger

Genesis isnt old she managed to interpolate He

But her frantic son disregarded her Secondhand washtubs he
vociferated And tin clothesboilers THATS what you want your SON to
carry through the public streets in broad daylight Ye gods

Well there isnt anybody else she said Please dont rave so
Willie and say Ye gods so much it really isnt nice Im sure nobody
ll notice you

Nobody His voice cracked in anguish Oh no Nobody except the
whole town WHY when theres anything disgusting has to be done
in this familywhy do _I_ always have to be the one Why cant Genesis
bring the secondhand washtubs without ME Why cant the secondhand
store deliver em Why cant

Thats what I want to tell you she interposed hurriedly and as the
youth lifted his arms on high in a gesture of ultimate despair and
then threw himself miserably into a chair she obtained the floor The
secondhand store doesnt deliver things she said I bought them at
an auction and its going out of business and they have to be taken
away before half past four this afternoon Genesis cant bring them in
the wheelbarrow because he says the wheel is broken and he says he
cant possibly carry two tubs and a washboiler himself and he cant
make two trips because its a mile and a half and I dont like to ask
him anyway and it would take too long because he has to get back and
finish cutting the grass before your papa gets home this evening Papa
said he HAD to Now I dont like to ask you but it really isnt much
You and Genesis can just slip up there and

Slip moaned William Just SLIP up there Ye gods

Genesis is waiting on the back porch she said Really it isnt worth
your making all this fuss about

Oh no he returned with plaintive satire Its nothing Nothing at
all

Why _I_ shouldnt mind it she said briskly if I had the time In
fact Ill have to if you wont

Ye gods He clasped his head in his hands crushed for he knew that
the curse was upon him and he must go Ye gods

And then as he stamped to the door his tragic eye fell upon Jane and
he emitted a final cry of pain

Cant you EVER wash your face he shouted




IV

GENESIS AND CLEMATIS

Genesis and his dog were waiting just outside the kitchen door and
of all the world these two creatures were probably the last in whose
company William Sylvanus Baxter desired to make a public appearance
Genesis was an outofdoors man and seldom made much of a toilet his
overalls in particular betraying at important points a lack of the
anxiety he should have felt since only Genesis himself instead of
a supplementary fabric was directly underneath them And the aged
grayish sleeveless and neckless garment which sheltered him from waist
to collarbone could not have been mistaken for a jersey even though
what there was of it was dimly of a jerseyesque character Upon the feet
of Genesis were things which careful study would have revealed to be
patentleather dancingpumps long dead and several times buried
and upon his head pressing down his markedly criminal ears was a
oncederby hat of a brown not far from Genesiss own color though
decidedly without his gloss A large ring of strange metals with the
stone missing adorned a finger of his right hand and from a corner of
his mouth projected an unlighted and spreading cigar stub which had the
appearance of belonging to its present owner merely by right of salvage

And Genesiss dog scratching himself at his masters feet was the true
complement of Genesis for although he was a youngish dog and had not
long been the property of Genesis he was a dog that would have been
recognized anywhere in the world as a colored persons dog He was not a
special breed of dogthough there was something rather houndlike about
himhe was just a dog His expression was grateful but anxious and he
was unusually bald upon the bosom but otherwise whitish and brownish
with a gaunt haunting face and no power to look anybody in the eye

He rose apprehensively as the fuming William came out of the kitchen
but he was prepared to follow his master faithfully and when William
and Genesis reached the street the dog was discovered at their heels
whereupon William came to a decisive halt

Send that dog back he said resolutely Im not going through the
streets with a dog like that anyhow

Genesis chuckled He ain goin back he said Ain nobody kin
make at dog go back I ain had him mon two weeks but I don blieve
Presdent United States kin make at dog go back I show you And
wheeling suddenly he made ferocious gestures shouting Gon back
dog

The dog turned ran back a few paces halted and then began to follow
again whereupon Genesis pretended to hurl stones at him but the animal
only repeated his manoeuverand he repeated it once more when William
aided Genesis by using actual missiles which were dodged with almost
careless adeptness

Ill show him said William hotly Ill show him he cant follow
ME He charged upon the dog shouting fiercely and this seemed to do
the work for the hunted animal abandoning his partial flights turned
a tuckedunder tail ran all the way back to the alley and disappeared
from sight There said William I guess that ll show him

I ain bettin on it said Genesis as they went on He nev did
stop follin me yet I reckon he the follindest dog in the worl Name
Clem

Well he cant follow ME said the surging William in whose minds
eye lingered the vision of an exquisite doglet with pinkribboned
throat and a cottony head bobbing gently over a filmy sleeve He
doesnt come within a mile of ME no matter what his name is

Name Clem fer short said Genesis amiably I trade in a mandoline
fer him what had her neck kind o busted off on one side I couldn play
her nohow an I found her anyways Yessuh I trade in at mandoline
fer him cause always did like to have me a good dogbut I din have
me no name fer him an this here Blooie Bowers what I trade in the
mandoline to he say HE din have no name fer him Say nev did know if
WAS a name fer him tall So Iz spen the evenin at at ladys house
Fanny what used to be cook fer Miz Johnson nex do you maws an
I ast Fanny what am I gon a do about it an Fanny say Call him
Clematis she say Ats a nice name she say Clematis So ats
name I name him Clematis Call him Clem fer short but Clematis his
real name Hell come whichever one you call him Clem or Clematis
Make no diffence to him longs he git his vittles Clem or Clematis
HE ain carin

Williams ear was deaf to this account of the naming of Clematis he
walked haughtily but as rapidly as possible trying to keep a little in
advance of his talkative companion who had never received the training
as a servitor which should have taught him his proper distance from the
Young Master Williams suffering eyes were fixed upon remoteness and
his lips moved now and then like a martyrs pronouncing inaudibly a
sacred word Milady Oh Milady

Thus they had covered some three blocks of their journeythe
toodemocratic Genesis chatting companionably and William burning with
mortificationwhen the former broke into loud laughter

What I tell you he cried pointing ahead Look ayonnuh NO suh
Presdent United States hissef ain go tell at dog stay home

And there at the corner before them waited Clematis roguishly lying
in a mudpuddle in the gutter He had run through alleys parallel to
their courseand in the face of such demoniac cunning the wretched
William despaired of evading his society Indeed there was nothing to
do but to give up and so the trio proceeded with William unable to
decide which contaminated him more Genesis or the loyal Clematis To
his way of thinking he was part of a dreadful pageant and he winced
pitiably whenever the eye of a respectable passerby fell upon him
Everybody seemed to starenay to leer And he felt that the whole
world would know his shame by nightfall

Nobody he reflected seeing him in such company could believe that he
belonged to one of the oldest and best families in town Nobody would
understand that he was not walking with Genesis for the pleasure of his
companionshipuntil they got the tubs and the washboiler when his
social condition must be thought even more degraded And nobody he was
shudderingly positive could see that Clematis was not his dog Clematis
kept himself humbly a little in the rear but how was any observer to
know that he belonged to Genesis and not to William

And how frightful that THIS should befall him on such a day the very
day that his soul had been split asunder by the turquoise shafts of
Miladys eyes and he had learned to know the Real Thing at last

Milady Oh Milady

For in the elder teens adolescence may be completed but not by
experience and these years know their own tragedies It is the time of
life when one finds it unendurable not to seem perfect in all outward
matters in worldly position in the equipments of wealth in family
and in the grace elegance and dignity of all appearances in
public And yet the youth is continually betrayed by the child still
intermittently insistent within him and by the child which undiplomatic
people too often assume him to be Thus with Williams attire he could
ill have borne any suggestion that it was not of the mode but taking
care of it was a different matter Also when it came to his appetite
he could and would eat anything at any time but something younger than
his years led himoften in semisecrecyto candystores and sodawater
fountains and icecream parlors he still relished green apples and knew
cravings for other dangerous inedibles But these survivals were far
from painful to him what injured his sensibilities was the disposition
on the part of people especially his parents and frequently his aunts
and unclesto regard him as a little boy Briefly the deference his
soul demanded in its own right not from strangers only but from
his family was about that which is supposed to be shown a Grand Duke
visiting his Estates Therefore William suffered often

But the full ignominy of the task his own mother had set him this
afternoon was not realized until he and Genesis set forth upon the
return journey from the secondhand shop bearing the two washtubs a
clotheswringer which Mrs Baxter had forgotten to mention and the
tin boilerand followed by the lowly Clematis




V

SORROWS WITHIN A BOILER

There was something really pageantlike about the little excursion now
and the glittering clothesboiler borne on high sent flashing lights
far down the street The washtubs were oldfashioned of wood they
refused to fit one within the other so William with his right hand
and Genesis with his left carried one of the tubs between them
Genesis carried the heavy wringer with his right hand and he had
fastened the other tub upon his back by means of a bit of rope which
passed over his shoulder thus the tin boiler being a lighter burden
fell to William

The cover would not stay in place but continually fell off when he
essayed to carry the boiler by one of its handles and he made shift
to manage the accursed thing in various waysthe only one proving
physically endurable being unfortunately the most grotesque He
was forced to carry the cover in his left hand and to place his head
partially within the boiler itself and to support ittilted obliquely
to rest upon his shouldersas a kind of monstrous tin cowl or helmet
This had the advantage of somewhat concealing his face though when
he leaned his head back in order to obtain clearer vision of what was
before him the boiler slid off and fell to the pavement with a noise
that nearly caused a runaway and brought the hotcheeked William much
derisory attention from a passing streetcar However he presently
caught the knack of keeping it in position and it fell no more

Seen from the rear William was unrecognizablebut interesting
He appeared to be a walking clothesboiler armed with a shield and
connected by means of a washtub with a negro of informal ideas
concerning dress In fact the group was whimsical and three young
people who turned in behind it out of a crossstreet indulged
immediately in fits of inadequately suppressed laughter though neither
Miss May Parcher nor Mr Johnnie Watson even remotely suspected that the
legs beneath the clothesboiler belonged to an acquaintance And as
for the third of this little party Miss Parchers visitor those
peregrinating legs suggested nothing familiar to her

Oh see the funee laundrymans she cried addressing a cottony
doglets head that bobbed gently up and down over her supporting arm
Sweetest Flopit must see too Flopit look at the funee laundrymans

Sh murmured Miss Parcher choking He might hear you

He might indeed since they were not five yards behind him and the
dulcet voice was clear and free Within the shadowy interior of the
clothesboiler were features stricken with sudden utter horror
FLOPIT

The attention of Genesis was attracted by a convulsive tugging of the
tub which he supported in common with William it seemed passionately to
urge greater speed A hissing issued from the boiler and Genesis caught
the words huskily whispered

Walk faster You got to walk faster

The tub between them tugged forward with a pathos of appeal wasted upon
the easygoing Genesis

I got plenty time cut at grass befo you pa gits home he said
reassuringly Thishere rope what I got my extry tub slung to is mos
wo plum thew my hide

Having uttered this protest he continued to ambulate at the same pace
though somewhat assisted by the forward pull of the connecting tub an
easance of burden which he found pleasant and no supplementary message
came from the clothesboiler for the reason that it was incapable
of further speech And so the two groups maintained for a time their
relative positions about fifteen feet apart

The amusement of the second group having abated through satiety the
minds of its components turned to other topics Now Flopit must have
his darlin ickle run said Flopits mistress setting the doglet upon
the ground Thats why sweetest Flopit and I and all of us came for a
walk instead of sitting on the nice cool porchkins SEE the sweetie
toddle Isnt he adorable May ISNT he adorable Mr Watson

Mr Watson put a useless sin upon his soul since all he needed to say
was a mere Yes He fluently avowed himself to have become insane over
the beauty of Flopit

Flopit placed upon the ground looked like something that had dropped
from a Christmas tree and he automatically made use of fuzzy legs
somewhat longer than a caterpillars to patter after his mistress He
was neither enterprising nor inquisitive he kept close to the rim of
her skirt which was as high as he could see and he wished to be taken
up and carried again He was in a halfstupor it was his desire
to remain in that condition and his propulsion was almost wholly
subconscious though surprisingly rapid considering his dimensions

My gooness exclaimed Genesis glancing back over his shoulder At
lil thing ack like he think he gon a GIT somewheres And then in
answer to a frantic pull upon the tub Look like you mighty strong
tday he said I cain go no fastuh He glanced back again
chuckling At lil bird do well not mix up nothin ith ole man
Clematis

Clematis it happened was just coming into view having been detained
round the corner by his curiosity concerning a set of Louis XVI
furniture which some housemovers were unpacking upon the sidewalk A
curl of excelsior in fact had attached itself to his nether lip
and he was pausing to remove itwhen his roving eye fell upon Flopit
Clematis immediately decided to let the excelsior remain where it was
lest he miss something really important

He approached with glowing eagerness at a gallop

Then having almost reached his goal he checked himself with surprising
abruptness and walked obliquely beside Flopit but upon a parallel
course his manner agitated and his brow furrowed with perplexity
Flopit was about the size of Clematiss head and although Clematis was
certain that Flopit was something alive he could not decide what

Flopit paid not the slightest attention to Clematis The selfimportance
of dogs like that of the minds of men is in directly inverse ratio to
their size and if the selfimportance of Flopit could have been taken
out of him and given to an elephant that elephant would have been
insufferable

Flopit continued to pay no attention to Clematis

All at once a roguish and irresponsible mood seized upon Clematis he
laid his nose upon the ground deliberating a bit of gaiety and then
with a little rush set a large rude paw upon the sensitive face
of Flopit and capsized him Flopit uttered a bitter complaint in an
asthmatic voice

Oh nassy dray bid Horror cried his mistress turning quickly at this
sound and waving a pink parasol at Clematis Shoo DIRTY dog Go way
And she was able somehow to connect him with the washtub and boiler
for she added Nassy laundrymans to have bad doggies

Mr Watson rushed upon Clematis with angry bellowings and imaginary
missiles You disgusting brute he roared How DARE you

Apparently much alarmed Clematis lowered his ears tucked his tail
underneath him and fled to the rear not halting once or looking back
until he disappeared round the corner whence he had come There said
Mr Watson I guess HE wont bother us again very soon

It must be admitted that Milady was one of those people who do not mind
being overheard no matter what they say Lucky for us she said
we had a nice dray bid MANS to protect us wasnt it Flopit And
she thought it necessary to repeat something she had already made
sufficiently emphatic

Nassy laundrymans

I expect I gave that big mongrel the fright of his life said Mr
Watson with complacency Hell probably run a mile

The shoulders of Genesis shook as he was towed along by the convulsive
tub He knew from previous evidence that Clematis possessed both a high
quality and a large quantity of persistence and it was his hilarious
opinion that the dog had not gone far As a matter of fact the head
of Clematis was at this moment cautiously extended from behind the
fencepost at the corner whither he had fled Viewing with growing
assurance the scene before him he permitted himself to emerge wholly
and sat down with his head tilted to one side in thought Almost at the
next corner the clothesboiler with legs and the washtubs and
Genesis were marching on and just behind them went three figures not
so familiar to Clematis and connected in his mind with a vague mild
apprehension But all backs were safely toward him and behind them
pattered that small live thing which had so profoundly interested him

He rose and came on apace silently

When he reached the side of Flopit some eight or nine seconds later
Clematis found himself even more fascinated and perplexed than during
their former interview though again Flopit seemed utterly to disregard
him Clematis was not at all sure that Flopit WAS a dog but he felt
that it was his business to find out Heaven knows so far Clematis had
not a particle of animosity in his heart but he considered it his duty
to himselfin case Flopit turned out not to be a dogto learn just
what he was The thing might be edible

Therefore again pacing obliquely beside Flopit while the human beings
ahead went on unconscious of the approaching climax behind them
Clematis sought to detect by senses keener than sight some evidence of
Flopits standing in the zoological kingdom and sniffing at the top
of Flopits headthough Clematis was uncertain about its indeed being a
headhe found himself baffled and mentally much disturbed

Flopit did not smell like a dog he smelled of violets




VI

TRUCULENCE

Clematis frowned and sneezed as the infinitesimal particles of sachet
powder settled in the lining of his nose He became serious and was
conscious of a growing feeling of dislike he began to be upset over the
whole matter But his conscience compelled him to persist in his
attempt to solve the mystery and also he remembered that one should
be courteous no matter what some other thing chooses to be Hence he
sought to place his nose in contact with Flopits for he had perceived
on the front of the mysterious stranger a buttony something which might
possibly be a nose

Flopit evaded the contact He felt that he had endured about enough
from this Apache and that it was nearly time to destroy him Having no
experience of battle save with bedroom slippers and lace handkerchiefs
Flopit had little doubt of his powers as a warrior Betrayed by his
majestic selfimportance he had not the remotest idea that he was
small Usually he saw the world from a window or from the seat of an
automobile or over his mistresss arm He looked down on all dogs
thought them ruffianly despised them and it is the miraculous truth
that not only was he unaware that he was small but he did not even know
that he was a dog himself He did not think about himself in that way

From these various ignorances of his sprang his astonishing his
incredible valor Clematis with head lowered close to Flopits
perceived something peering at him from beneath the tangled curtain
of cottony violetscented stuff which seemed to be the upper part of
Flopits face It was Flopits eye a redrimmed eye and soreand so
demoniacally malignant that Clematis indescribably startled would
have withdrawn his own countenance at oncebut it was too late With a
fearful oath Flopit sprang upward and annexed himself to the under lip
of the horrified Clematis

Horror gave place to indignation instantly and as Miss Parcher and her
guest turned screaming Clematiss selfcommand went all to pieces

Miss Parcher became faint and leaned against the hedge along which they
had been passing but her visitor continued to scream while Mr Watson
endeavored to kick Clematis without ruining Flopita difficult matter

Flopit was baresark from the first and the mystery is where he
learned the dogcursing that he did In spite of the DavidandGoliath
difference in size it would be less than justice to deny that a very
fair dogfight took place It was so animated in truth that the one
expert in such matters who was present found himself warmly interested
Genesis relieved himself of the burden of the washtub upon his back
dropped the handle of that other in which he had a halfinterest
and watched the combat his mouth like his eyes wide open in simple
pleasure

He was not destined to enjoy the spectacle to the uttermost a furious
young person struck him a frantic though harmless blow with a pink
parasol

You stop them she screamed You make that horrible dog stop or Ill
have you arrested

Genesis rushed forward

You CLEM he shouted

And instantly Clematis was but a whitish and brownish streak along the
hedge He ran like a dog in a moving picture when they speed the film
and he shot from sight once more round the corner while Flopit still
cursing was seized and squeezed in his mistresss embrace

But she was not satisfied Wheres that laundryman with the tin thing
on his head she demanded He ought to be arrested for having such a
dog Its HIS dog isnt it Where is he

Genesis turned and looked round about the horizon mystified William
Sylvanus Baxter and the clothesboiler had disappeared from sight

If he owns that dog asserted the still furious owner of Flopit I
WILL have him arrested Where is he Where is that laundryman

Why he Genesis began slowly HE ain no laundrym He came to an
uncertain pause If she chose to assume with quick feminine intuition
that the dog was Williams and that William was a laundryman it was not
Genesiss place to enlighten her Ticlarly he reflected since
she talk so free about gittin people rested He became aware that
William had squirmed through the hedge and now lay prostrate on the
other side of it but this likewise was something within neither his
duty nor his inclination to reveal

Thishere laundryman said Genesis resumingthishere laundryman what
own the dog I reckon he mus hopped on at streetcar what went by

Well he OUGHT to be arrested she said and pressing her cheek
to Flopits she changed her tone Izzums ickle heart abeatin so
floppity Ums own mumsy make ums all right ums peshus Flopit

Then with the consoling Miss Parchers arm about her and Mr Watson
even more dazzled with love than when he had first met her some three
hours past she made her way between the tubs and passed on down the
street Not till the three and Flopit were out of sight did William
come forth from the hedge

Hi yah exclaimed Genesis At lady gon a rest evy man what own a
dog f she had her way

But William spoke no word

In silence then they resumed their burdens and their journey Clematis
was waiting for them at the corner ahead

MR BAXTERS EVENING CLOTHES

That evening at about halfpast seven oclock dinner being over and
Mr and Mrs Baxter parents of William seated in the library Mrs
Baxter said

I think its about time for you to go and dress for your Emerson Club
meeting papa if you intend to go

Do I have to dress Mr Baxter asked plaintively

I think nearly all the men do dont they she insisted

But Im getting old enough not to have to dont you think mamma he
urged appealingly When a mans my age

Nonsense she said Your figure is exactly like Williams Its the
figure that really shows age first and yours hasnt begun to And she
added briskly Go along like a good boy and get it ever

Mr Baxter rose submissively and went upstairs to do as he was bid But
after fifteen or twenty minutes during which his footsteps had
been audible in various parts of the house he called down over the
banisters

I cant find em

Cant find what

My evening clothes They arent anywhere in the house

Where did you put them the last time you wore them she called

I dont know I havent had em on since last spring

All right Ill come she said putting her sewing upon the table and
rising Men never can find anything she observed additionally as
she ascended the stairs Especially their own things

On this occasion however as she was obliged to admit a little later
women were not more efficacious than the duller sex Search high search
low no trace of Mr Baxters evening clothes were to be found Perhaps
William could find them said Mrs Baxter a final confession of
helplessness

But William was no more to be found than the missing apparel William
in fact after spending some time in the lower back hall listening to
the quest above had just gone out through the kitchen door And after
some ensuing futile efforts Mr Baxter was forced to proceed to his
club in the accoutrements of business

He walked slowly enjoying the full moon which sailed up a river in the
skythe open space between the trees that lined the streetand as
he passed the house of Mr Parcher he noted the fine white shape of a
masculine evening bosom gleaming in the moonlight on the porch A
dainty figure in white sat beside it and there was another white figure
present though this one was so small that Mr Baxter did not see it at
all It was the figure of a tiny doglet and it reposed upon the black
masculine knees that belonged to the evening bosom

Mr Baxter heard a dulcet voice

He IS indifferink isnt he sweetest Flopit Seriously though
Mr Watson was telling me about you today He says youre the most
indifferent man he knows He says you dont care two minutes whether a
girl lives or dies Isnt he a mean ole wicked sing peshus Flopit

The reply was inaudible and Mr Baxter passed on having recognized
nothing of his own

These YOUNG fellows dont have any trouble finding their dresssuits I
guess he murmured Not on a night like this


 Thus William after a hard day came to the gates of his romance
entering those portals of the moon in triumph At one stroke his dashing
raiment gave him high superiority over Johnnie Watson and other rivals
who might loom But if he had known to what undoing this great coup
exposed him it is probable that Mr Baxter would have appeared at the
Emerson Club that night in evening clothes




VIII

JANE

Williams period of peculiar sensitiveness dated from that evening and
Jane in particular caused him a great deal of anxiety In fact he
began to feel that Jane was a mortification which his parents might have
spared him with no loss to themselves or to the world Not having
shown that consideration for anybody they might at least have been less
spinelessly indulgent of her Williams bitter conviction was that he
had never seen a child so starved of discipline or so lost to etiquette
as Jane

For one thing her passion for breadandbutter covered with apple
sauce and powdered sugar was getting to be a serious matter Secretly
William was not yet so changed by love as to be wholly indifferent to
this refection himself but his consumption of it was private whereas
Jane had formed the habit of eating it in exposed placessuch as the
front yard or the sidewalk At no hour of the day was it advisable for
a relative to approach the neighborhood in fastidious company unless
prepared to acknowledge kinship with a spindly young person either
eating breadandbutter and apple sauce and powdered sugar or all too
visibly just having eaten breadandbutter and apple sauce and powdered
sugar Moreover there were times when Jane had worse things than apple
sauce to answer for as William made clear to his mother in an oration
as hot as the July noon sun which looked down upon it

Mrs Baxter was pleasantly engaged with a sprinklingcan and some small
flowerbeds in the shady back yard and Jane having returned from
various sidewalk excursions stood close by as a spectator her hands
replenished with the favorite food and her chin rising and falling in
gentle motions little prophecies of the slight distensions which passed
down her slender throat with slow rhythmic regularity Upon this calm
scene came William plunging round a corner of the house furious yet
plaintive

Youve got to do something about that child he began I CAN not
stand it

Jane looked at him dumbly not ceasing how ever to eat while Mrs
Baxter thoughtfully continued her sprinkling

Youve been gone all morning Willie she said I thought your father
mentioned at breakfast that he expected you to put in at least four
hours a day on your mathematics and

Thats neither here nor there William returned vehemently I just
want to say this if you dont do something about Jane I will Just
look at her LOOK at her I ask you Thats just the way she looked half
an hour ago out on the public sidewalk in front of the house when
I came by here with Miss PRATT That was pleasant wasnt it To be
walking with a lady on the public street and meet a member of my family
looking like that Oh LOVELY

In the anguish of this recollection his voice cracked and though his
eyes were dry his gestures wept for him Plainly he was about to reach
the most lamentable portion of his narrative And then she HOLLERED at
me She hollered Oh WILLEE Here he gave an imitation of Janes
voice so damnatory that Jane ceased to eat for several moments and drew
herself up with a kind of dignity She hollered Oh WILLEE at
me he stormed Anybody would think I was about six years old She
hollered Oh Willee and she rubbed her stomach and slushed apple
sauce all over her face and she kept hollering Willee with her
mouth full Willee look Good Breadandbutter and apple sauce and
sugar I bet you wish YOU had some Willee

You did eat some the other day said Jane You ate a whole lot You
eat it every chance you get

You hush up he shouted and returned to his description of the
outrage She kept FOLLOWING us She followed us hollering WILLEE
till its a wonder we didnt go deaf And just look at her I dont
see how you can stand it to have her going around like that and people
knowing its your child Why she hasnt got enough ON

Mrs Baxter laughed Oh for this very hot weather I really dont
think people notice or care much about

Notice he wailed I guess Miss PRATT noticed Hot weathers no
excuse forfor outright obesity As Jane was thin it is probable
that William had mistaken the meaning of this word Why half o what
she HAS got on has come unfastenedespecially that frightful thing
hanging around her legand look at her back I just beg you I ask you
to look at her back You can see her spinal cord

Column Mrs Baxter corrected Spinal column Willie

What do _I_ care which it is he fumed People arent supposed to go
around with it EXPOSED whichever it is And with apple sauce on their
ears

There is not Jane protested and at the moment when she spoke she was
right Naturally however she lifted her hands to the accused ears and
the unfortunate result was to justify Williams statement

LOOK he cried I just ask you to look Think of it thats the sight
I have to meet when Im out walking with Miss PRATT She asked me who
it was and I wish youd seen her face She wanted to know who that
curious child was and Im glad you didnt hear the way she said it
Who IS that curious child she said and I had to tell her it was my
sister I had to tell Miss PRATT it was my only SISTER

Willie who is Miss Pratt asked Mrs Baxter mildly I dont think
Ive ever heard of

Jane had returned to an admirable imperturbability but she chose
this moment to interrupt her mother and her own eating with remarks
delivered in a tone void of emphasis or expression

Willies mashed on her she said casually And she wears false
sidecurls One almost came off

At this unspeakable desecration Williams face was that of a high priest
stricken at the altar

Shes visitin Miss May Parcher added the deadly Jane But the
Parchers are awful tired of her They wish shed go home but they dont
like to tell her so

One after another these insults from the canaille fell upon the ears of
William That slanders so atrocious could soil the universal air seemed
unthinkable

He became icily calm

NOW if you dont punish her he said deliberately its because you
have lost your sense of duty

Having uttered these terrible words he turned upon his heel and marched
toward the house His mother called after him

Wait Willie Jane doesnt mean to hurt your feelings

My feelings he cried the iciness of his demeanor giving way under
the strain of emotion You stand there and allow her to speak as she
did of one of theone of the For a moment William appeared to be at
a loss and the fact is that it always has been a difficult matter to
describe THE bright ineffable divinity of the world to ones mother
especially in the presence of an inimical third party of tender years
One of the he said one of thethe noblestone of the noblest

Again he paused

Oh Jane didnt mean anything said Mrs Baxter And if you think
Miss Pratt is so nice Ill ask May Parcher to bring her to tea with us
some day If its too hot well have iced tea and you can ask Johnnie
Watson if you like Dont get so upset about things Willie

Upset he echoed appealing to heaven against this word Upset
And he entered the house in a manner most dramatic

What made you say that Mrs Baxter asked turning curiously to Jane
when William had disappeared Where did you hear any such things

I was there Jane replied gently eating on and on William could come
and William could go but Janes alimentary canal went on forever

You were where Jane

At the Parchers

Oh I see

Yesterday afternoon said Jane when Miss Parcher had the
Sundayschool class for lemonade and cookies

Did you hear Miss Parcher say

Nom said Jane I ate too many cookies I guess maybe Anyways
Miss Parcher said I better lay down

LIE down Jane

Yesm On the sofa in the liberry an Mrs Parcher an Mr Parcher
came in there an sat down after while an it was kind of dark an
they didnt hardly notice me or I guess they thought I was asleep
maybe Anyways they didnt talk loud but Mr Parcher would sort of
grunt an ack cross He said he just wished he knew when he was goin
to have a home again Then Mrs Parcher said May HAD to ask her
Sundayschool class but he said he never meant the Sundayschool class
He said since Miss Pratt came to visit there wasnt anywhere he could
go because Willie Baxter an Johnnie Watson an Joe Bullitt an all the
other ones like that were there all the time an it made him just sick
at the stummick an he did wish there was some way to find out when she
was goin home because he couldnt stand much more talk about love
He said Willie an Johnnie Watson an Joe Bullitt an Miss Pratt were
always arguin somepm about love an he said Willie was the worst
Mamma he said he didnt like the rest of it but he said he guessed he
could stand it if it wasnt for Willie An he said the reason they were
all so in love of Miss Pratt was because she talks babytalk an he
said he couldnt stand much more babytalk Mamma she has the loveliest
little white dog an Mr Parcher doesnt like it He said he couldnt
go anywhere around the place without steppin on the dog or Willie
Baxter An he said he couldnt sit on his own porch any more he said
he couldnt sit even in the liberry but he had to hear babytalk goin
on SOMEwheres an then either Willie Baxter or Joe Bullitt or
somebody or another arguin about love Mamma he saidJane became
impressivehe said mamma he said he didnt mind the Sundayschool
class but he couldnt stand those dam boys

Jane Mrs Baxter cried you MUSTNT say such things

I didnt mamma Mr Parcher said it He said he couldnt stand those
da

JANE No matter what he said you mustnt repeat

But Im not I only said Mr PARCHER said he couldnt stand those d

Mrs Baxter cut the argument short by imprisoning Janes mouth with a
firm hand Jane continued to swallow quietly until released Then she
said

But mamma how can I tell you what he said unless I say

Hush Mrs Baxter commanded You must never never again use such a
terrible and wicked word

I wont mamma Jane said meekly Then she brightened Oh _I_ know
Ill say word instead Wont that be all right

II suppose so

Well Mr Parcher said he couldnt stand those word boys That sounds
all right doesnt it mamma

Mrs Baxter hesitated but she was inclined to hear as complete as
possible a report of Mr and Mrs Parchers conversation since it
seemed to concern William so nearly and she well knew that Jane had her
own way of telling thingsor else they remained untold

II suppose so Mrs Baxter said again

Well they kind of talked along Jane continued much pleasedan
Mr Parcher said when he was young he wasnt any such asuch a word
fool as these young word fools were He said in all his born days Willie
Baxter was the wordest fool he ever saw

Willie Baxters mother flushed a little That was very unjust and very
wrong of Mr Parcher she said primly

Oh no mamma Jane protested Mrs Parcher thought so too

Did she indeed

Only she didnt say word or wordest or anything like that Jane
explained She said it was because Miss Pratt had coaxed him to be so
in love of her an Mr Parcher said he didnt care whose fault it was
Willie was aa word calf an so were all the rest of em Mr Parcher
said An he said he couldnt stand it any more Mr Parcher said that a
whole lot of times mamma He said he guess pretty soon hed haf to be
in the lunatic asylum if Miss Pratt stayed a few more days with her word
little dog an her word Willie Baxter an all the other word calfs Mrs
Parcher said he oughtnt to say word mamma She said Hush hush
to him mamma He talked like this mamma he said Ill be word if I
stand it An he kept gettin crosser an he said Word Word WORD
WOR

There Mrs Baxter interrupted sharply That will do Jane Well
talk about something else now I think

Jane looked hurt she was taking great pleasure in this confidential
interview and gladly would have continued to quote the harried Mr
Parcher at great length Still she was not entirely uncontent she must
have had some perception that her performance merely as a notable bit of
reportorial artdid not wholly lack style even if her attire did Yet
brilliant as Janes work was Mrs Baxter felt no astonishment several
times ere this Jane had demonstrated a remarkable faculty for the
retention of details concerning William And running hand in hand with
a really superb curiosity this powerful memory was making Jane an even
greater factor in Williams life than he suspected

During the glamors of early love if there be a creature more deadly
than the little brother of a budding woman that creature is the little
sister of a budding man The little brother at least tells in the open
all he knows often at full power of his lungs and even that may be
avoided since he is wax in the hands of bribery but the little sister
is more apt to save her knowledge for use upon a terrible occasion and
no matter what bribes she may accept she is certain to tell her mother
everything All in all a young lover should arrange if possible to be
the only child of elderly parents otherwise his mother and sister are
sure to know a great deal more about him than he knows that they know

This was what made Janes eyes so disturbing to William during lunch
that day She ate quietly and competently but all the while he was
conscious of her solemn and inscrutable gaze fixed upon him and she
spoke not once She could not have rendered herself more annoying
especially as William was trying to treat her with silent scorn for
nothing is more irksome to the muscles of the face than silent scorn
when there is no means of showing it except by the expression On the
other hand Janes inscrutability gave her no discomfort whatever In
fact inscrutability is about the most comfortable expression that a
person can wear though the truth is that just now Jane was not really
inscrutable at all

She was merely looking at William and thinking of Mr Parcher




IX

LITTLE SISTERS HAVE BIG EARS

The confidential talk between mother and daughter at noon was not
the last to take place that day At nightfalleight oclock in this
pleasant seasonJane was saying her prayers beside her bed while her
mother stood close by waiting to put out the light

An bless mamma and papa an Jane murmured coming to a pause
Anan bless Willie she added with a little reluctance

Go on dear said her mother You havent finished

I know it mamma Jane looked up to say I was just thinkin a
minute I want to tell you about somepm

Finish your prayers first Jane

Jane obeyed with a swiftness in which there was no intentional
irreverence Then she jumped into bed and began a fresh revelation

Its about papas cloes mamma

What clothes of papas What do you mean Jane asked Mrs Baxter
puzzled

The ones you couldnt find The ones you been lookin for most every
day

You mean papas evening clothes

Yesm said Jane Willies got em on

What

Yes he has Jane assured her with emphasis I bet you hes had em
on every single evening since Miss Pratt came to visit the Parchers
Anyway hes got em on now cause I saw em

Mrs Baxter bit her lip and frowned Are you sure Jane

Yesm I saw him in em

How

Well I was in my bare feet after I got undressedbefore you came
upstairsmamma an I was kind of walkin around in the hall

You shouldnt do that Jane

Nom An I heard Willie say somepm kind of to himself or like
deckamation He was inside his room but the door wasnt quite shut He
started out once but he went back for somepm an forgot to I guess
Anyway I thought I better look an see what was goin on mamma So I
just kind of peeked in

But you shouldnt do that dear Mrs Baxter said musingly It isnt
really quite honorable

Nom Well what you think he was doin Here Janes voice betrayed
excitement and so did her eyes He was standin up there in papas
cloes before the lookinglass an first hed lean his head over on
one side an then hed lean it over on the other side an then hed
bark mamma

Hed what

Yesm said Jane Hed give a little teeny BARK mammakind of like
a puppy mamma

What cried Mrs Baxter

Yesm he did Jane asserted He did it four or five times First
hed lean his head way over on his shoulder like thislook mammaan
then hed lean it way over the other shoulder an every time hed do it
hed bark Berpwerp hed say mamma just like that only not loud
at all He said Berpwerp BERPWERPWERP You could tell he meant
it for barkin but it wasnt very good mamma What you think he meant
mamma

Heaven knows murmured the astonished mother

An then Jane continued he quit barkin all of a sudden an didnt
lean his head over any more an commenced actin kind of solemn an
kind of whispered to himself I think he was kind of pretendin he was
talkin to Miss Pratt or at a party maybe Anyways he spoke out loud
after while not just exactly LOUD I mean but anyway sos t I could
hear what he said Mammahe said Oh my babytalk lady just like
that mamma Listen mamma heres the way he said it Oh my babytalk
lady

Janes voice in this impersonation became sufficiently soft and
tremulous to give Mrs Baxter a fair idea of the tender yearning of the
original OH MY BABYTALK LADY cooed the terrible Jane

Mercy Mrs Baxter exclaimed Perhaps its no wonder Mr Parcher
She broke off abruptly then inquired What did he do next Jane

Next said Jane he put the light out an I had towell I just
waited kind of squeeged up against the wall an he never saw me He
went on out to the back stairs an went down the stairs tiptoe mamma
You know what I think mamma I think he goes out that way an through
the kitchen on account of papas cloes

Mrs Baxter paused with her hand upon the key of the shaded electric
lamp I suppose so she said I think perhaps For a moment or
two she wrapped herself in thought Perhapsshe repeated
musinglyperhaps well keep this just a secret between you and me for
a little while Jane and not say anything to papa about the clothes I
dont think it will hurt them and I suppose Willie feels they give
him a great advantage over the other boysand papa uses them so very
little especially since hes grown a wee bit stouter Yes it will be
our secret Jane Well think it over till tomorrow

Yesm

Mrs Baxter turned out the light then came and kissed Jane in the dark
Good night dear

G night mamma But as Mrs Baxter reached the door Janes voice was
heard again

Mamma

Yes Mrs Baxter paused

Mamma Jane said slowly I thinkI think Mr Parcher is a very nice
man Mamma

Yes dear

Mamma what do you spose Willie barked at the lookinglass for

That said Mrs Baxter is beyond me Young people and children do
the strangest things Jane And then when they get to be middleaged
they forget all those strange things they did and they cant understand
what the new young peoplelike you and Willie mean by the strange
things THEY do

Yesm I bet _I_ know what he was barkin for mamma

Well

You know what I think I think he was kind of practisin I think he
was practisin how to bark at Mr Parcher

No no Mrs Baxter laughed Who ever could think of such a thing but
you Jane You go to sleep and forget your nonsense

Nevertheless Jane might almost have been gifted with clairvoyance her
preposterous idea came so close to the actual fact for at that very
moment William was barking He was not barking directly at Mr Parcher
it is true but within a short distance of him and all too well within
his hearing

MR PARCHER AND LOVE

Mr Parcher that unhappy gentleman having been driven indoors from his
own porch had attempted to read Plutarchs Lives in the library but
owing to the adjacency of the porch and the summer necessity for open
windows his escape spared only his eyes and not his suffering ears The
house was small being but half of a double one with small rooms and
the parlor library and diningroom all about equally exposed to the
porch which ran along the side of the house Mr Parcher had no refuge
except bed or the kitchen and as he was troubled with chronic insomnia
and the cook had callers in the kitchen his case was desperate Most
unfortunately too his readinglamp the only one in the house was a
fixture near a window and just beyond that window sat Miss Pratt and
William in sweet unconsciousness while Miss Parcher entertained the
overflow consisting of Mr Johnnie Watson at the other end of the
porch Listening perforce to the conversation of the former couple
though conversation is far from the expression later used by Mr
Parcher to describe what he heardhe found it impossible to sit
still in his chair He jerked and twitched with continually increasing
restlessness sometimes he gasped and other times he moaned a little
and there were times when he muttered huskily

Oh cuteums came the silvery voice of Miss Pratt from the likewise
silvery porch outside underneath the summer moon Darlin Flopit
look Ickle boy Baxter goin make imitations of darlin Flopit again
See Ickle boy Baxter puts head one side then other side just
like darlin Flopit Then barks just like darlin Flopit Ladies and
entlemen imitations of darlin Flopit by ickle boy Baxter

Berpwerp Berpwerp came the voice of William Sylvanus Baxter

And in the library Plutarchs Lives moved convulsively while with
writhing lips Mr Parcher muttered to himself

More more cried Miss Pratt clapping her hands Do it again ickle
boy Baxter

Berpwerp Berpwerpwerp

WORD muttered Mr Parcher

Miss Pratts voice became surcharged with honeyed wonder How did he
learn such marvlous MARVLOUS imitations of darlin Flopit He ought
to go on the big big stage and be a really actor oughtnt he darlin
Flopit He could make milyums and milyums of dollardies couldnt he
darlin Flopit

Williams modest laugh disclaimed any great ambition for himself in this
line Oh I always could think up imitations of animals things like
thatbut I hardly would care toto adop the stage for a career
Wouldyou There was a thrill in his voice when he pronounced the
ineffably significant word you

Miss Pratt became intensely serious

Its my DREAM she said

William seated upon a stool at her feet gazed up at the amber head
divinely splashed by the rain of moonlight The fire with which she
spoke stirred him as few things had ever stirred him He knew she had
just revealed a side of herself which she reserved for only the chosen
few who were capable of understanding her and he fell into a hushed
rapture It seemed to him that there was a sacredness about this moment
and he sought vaguely for something to say that would live up to it and
not be out of keeping Then like an inspiration there came into his
head some words he had read that day and thought beautiful He had found
them beneath an illustration in a magazine and he spoke them almost
instinctively

It was wonderful of you to say that to me he said I shall never
forget it

Its my DREAM Miss Pratt exclaimed again with the same enthusiasm
Its my DREAM

You would make a glorious actress he said

At that her mood changed She laughed a laugh like a sweet little girls
laugh not Janes and setting her rockingchair in motion cuddled the
fuzzy white doglet in her arms Ickle boy Baxter tyin flatterbox us
tunnin Flopit Noty noty flatterbox

No no William insisted earnestly I mean it Butbut

But whatcums

What do you think about actors and actresses making love to each other
on the stage Do you think they have to really feel it or do they just
pretend

Well said Miss Pratt weightily sometimes one way sometimes the
other

Williams gravity became more and more profound Yes but how can they
pretend like that Dont you think love is a sacred thing Cousin Lola

Fictitious sisterships brotherships and cousinships are devices to
push things along well known to seventeen and even more advanced ages
On the wonderful evening of their first meeting William and Miss Pratt
had cozily arranged to be called respectively Ickle boy Baxter and
Cousin Lola Thus they had broken down the tedious formalities of
their first twenty minutes together

Dont you think love is sacred he repeated in the deepest tone of
which his vocal cords were capable

Ess said Miss Pratt

_I_ do William was emphatic I think love is the most sacred thing
there is I dont mean SOME kinds of love I mean REAL love You take
some people I dont believe they ever know what real love means They
TALK about it maybe but they dont understand it Love is something
nobody can understand unless they feel it and and if they dont
understand it they dont feel it Dont YOU think so

Ess

Love William continued his voice lifting and thrilling to the great
themelove is something nobody can ever have but one time in their
lives and if they dont have it then why probly they never will
Now if a man REALLY loves a girl why hed do anything in the world she
wanted him to Dont YOU think so

Ess deedums said the silvery voice

But if he didnt then he wouldnt said William vehemently But when
a man really loves a girl he will Now you take a man like that and
he can generally do just about anything the girl he loves wants him
to Say frinstance she wants him to love her even more than he does
alreadyor almost anything like thatand supposin she asks him to
Well he would go ahead and do it If they really loved each other he
would

He paused a moment then in a lowered tone he said I think REAL love
is sacred dont you

Ess

Dont you think love is the most sacred thing there isthat is if
its REAL love

Ess

_I_ do said William warmly IIm glad you feel like that because
I think real love is the kind nobody could have but just once in their
lives but if it isnt REAL love whywhy most people never have it at
all because He paused seeming to seek for the exact phrase which
would express his meaning Because the REAL love a man feels for a
girl and a girl for a man if they REALLY love each other and you look
at a case like that of course they would BOTH love each other or it
wouldnt be real love well what _I_ say is if its REAL love well
itsits sacred because I think that kind of love is always sacred
Dont you think love is sacred if its the real thing

Ess said Miss Pratt Do Flopit again Be Flopit

Berpwerp Berpwerpwerp

And within the library an agonized man writhed and muttered

WORD WORD WORD

This hoarse repetition had become almost continuous

 But out on the porch that little jasminescented bower in
Arcady where youth cried to youth and golden heads were haloed in the
moonshine there fell a silence Not utter silence for out there an
ethereal music sounded constantly unheard and forgotten by older ears
Time was when the sly playwrights used incidental music in their
dramas they knew that an audience would be moved so long as the music
played credulous while that crafty enchantment lasted And when the
galled Mr Parcher wondered how those young people out on the porch
could listen to each other and not die it was because he did not
hear and had forgotten the music that throbs in the veins of youth
Nevertheless it may not be denied that despite his poor memory this man
of fifty was deserving of a little sympathy

It was William who broke the silence How he began and his voice
trembled a little Howhow do youhow do you think of me when Im not
with you

Think nicecums Miss Pratt responded Flopit an me think
nicecums

No said William I mean what name do you have for me when youre
when youre thinking about me

Miss Pratt seemed to be puzzled perhaps justifiably and she made a
cooing sound of interrogation

I mean like this William explained Frinstance when you first
came I always thought of you as Miladywhen I wrote that poem you
know

Ess Boofums

But now I dont he said Now I think of you by another name when Im
alone Itit just sort of came to me I was kind of just sitting around
this afternoon and I didnt know I was thinking about anything at all
very much and then all of a sudden I said it to myself out loud It was
about as strange a thing as I ever knew of Dont YOU think so

Ess It uz dest WEIRD she answered What ARE dat pitty names

I called you said William huskily and reverently I called you My
BabyTalk Lady

BANG

They were startled by a crash from within the library a heavy weight
seemed to have fallen or to have been hurled a considerable distance
Stepping to the window William beheld a large volume lying in a
distorted attitude at the foot of the wall opposite to that in which the
readinglamp was a fixture But of all human life the room was empty
for Mr Parcher had given up and was now hastening to his bed in the
last faint hope of saving his reason

His symptoms however all pointed to its having fled and his wife
looking up from some computations in laundry charges had but a vision
of windmill gestures as he passed the door of her room Then not only
for her but for the inoffensive people who lived in the other half of
the house the closing of his own door took place in a really memorable
manner

William gazing upon the fallen Plutarch had just offered the
explanation Somebody must a thrown it at a bug or something I
guess when the second explosion sent its reverberations through the
house

My doodness Miss Pratt exclaimed jumping up

William laughed reassuringly remaining calm Its only a door blew
shut upstairs he said Lets sit down againjust the way we were

Unfortunately for him Mr Joe Bullitt now made his appearance at the
other end of the porch Mr Bullitt though almost a year younger than
either William or Johnnie Watson was of a turbulent and masterful
disposition Moreover in regard to Miss Pratt his affections were
in as ardent a state as those of his rivals and he lacked Johnnies
meekness He firmly declined to be shunted by Miss Parcher who was
trying to favor Williams cause according to a promise he had won of
her by strong pleading Regardless of her efforts Mr Bullitt descended
upon William and his BabyTalkLady and received from the latter a
honeyed greeting somewhat to the formers astonishment and not at all
to his pleasure

Oh goodycute cried Miss Pratt Heres big Bruvva JosieJoe And
she lifted her little dog close to Mr Bullitts face guiding one of
Flopits paws with her fingers Stroke big Bruvva JosieJoes pint
teeks darlin Flopit JosieJoes pink cheeks were indicated by the
expression pint teeks evidently for her accompanying action was to
pass Flopits paw lightly over those glowing surfaces Ats nice
she remarked Stroke him gently peshus Flopit an nen well coax him
to make pitty singin for us like us did yestiday

She turned to William

COAX him to make pitty singin I LOVE his voiceIm dest CRAZY over
it Isnt oo

Williams passion for Mr Bullitts voice appeared to be under control
He laughed coldly almost harshly Him sing he said Has he been
tryin to sing around HERE I wonder the family didnt call for the
police

It was to be seen that Mr Bullitt did not relish the sally Well they
will he retorted if you ever spring one o your solos on em And
turning to Miss Pratt he laughed loudly and bitterly You ought to
hear Silly Bill singsome time when you dont mind goin to bed sick
for a couple o days

Symptoms of truculence at once became alarmingly pronounced on both
sides William was naturally incensed and as for Mr Bullitt he had
endured a great deal from William every evening since Miss Pratts
arrival Williams evening clothes were hard enough for both Mr Watson
and Mr Bullitt to bear without any additional insolence on the part
of the wearer Big Bruvva JosieJoe took a step toward his enemy and
breathed audibly

Lets ALL sing the tactful Miss Pratt proposed hastily Come on
May and Cousin JohnnieJumpUp she called to Miss Parcher and Mr
Watson Singinschool dirls an boys Singinschool Ding ding
Singinschool bells awingin

The diversion was successful Miss Parcher and Mr Watson joined the
other group with alacrity and the five young people were presently
seated close together upon the steps of the porch sending their voices
out upon the air and up to Mr Parchers window in the song they found
loveliest that summer

Miss Pratt carried the air William also carried it part of the time
and hunted for it the rest of the time though never in silence Miss
Parcher sang alto Mr Bullitt sang bass and Mr Watson sang
tenorthat is he sang as high as possible often making the top sound
of a chord and always repeating the last phrase of each line before the
others finished it The melody was a little too sweet possibly while
the singers thought so highly of the words that Mr Parcher missed not
one especially as the vocal rivalry between JosieJoe and Ickle Boy
Baxter incited each of them to prevent Miss Pratt from hearing the
other

William sang loudest of all Mr Parcher had at no time any difficulty
in recognizing his voice

 Oh I love my love in the morning
 And I love my love at night
 I love my love in the dawning
 And when the stars are bright
 Some may love the sunshine
 Others may love the dew
 Some may love the raindrops
 But I love only youOOoo
 By the stars up above
 It is you I luhHUV
 Yes _I_ love ownLAY you

They sang it four times then Mr Bullitt sang his solo Tell her O
Golden Moon how I Adore her William following with The violate loves
the cowslip but _I_ love YEW and after that they all sang Oh I
love my love in the morning again

All this while that they sang of love Mr Parcher was moving to and fro
upon his bed not more than eighteen feet in an oblique upwardslanting
line from the heads of the serenaders Long long he tossed listening
to the young voices singing of love long long he thought of love and
many many times he spoke of it aloud though he was alone in the room
And in thus speaking of it he would give utterance to phrases and
words probably never before used in connection with love since the world
began

His thoughts and at intervals his mutterings continued to be active
far into the night long after the callers had gone and though his
household and the neighborhood were at rest with never a katydid
outside to rail at the waning moon And by a coincidence not more
singular than most coincidences it happened that at just about the time
he finally fell asleep a young lady at no great distance from him awoke
to find her self thinking of him




XI

BEGINNING A TRUE FRIENDSHIP

This was Miss Jane Baxter She opened her eyes upon the newborn day
and her first thoughts were of Mr Parcher That is he was already
in her mind when she awoke a circumstance to be accounted for on the
ground that his conversation during her quiet convalescence in his
library had so fascinated her that in all likelihood she had been
dreaming of him Then too Jane and Mr Parcher had a bond in common
though Mr Parcher did not know it Not without result had William
repeated Miss Pratts inquiry in Janes hearing Who IS that curious
child Jane had preserved her sangfroid but the words remained with
her for she was one of those who ponder and retain in silence

She thought almost exclusively of Mr Parcher until breakfasttime and
resumed her thinking of him at intervals during the morning Then in
the afternoon a series of quiet events not unconnected with Williams
passion caused her to think of Mr Parcher more poignantly than ever
nor was her mind diverted to a different channel by another confidential
conversation with her mother Who can say then that it was not by
design that she came face to face with Mr Parcher on the public highway
at about five oclock that afternoon Everything urges the belief that
she deliberately set herself in his path

Mr Parcher was walking home from his office and he walked slowly
gulping from time to time as he thought of the inevitable evening
before him His was not a rugged constitution and for the last
fortnight or so he had feared that it was giving way altogether Each
evening he felt that he was growing weaker and sometimes he thought
piteously that he might go away for a while He did not much care where
though what appealed to him most curiously enough was not the thought
of the country with the flowers and little birds no what allured him
was the idea that perhaps he could find lodgment for a time in an Old
Peoples Home where the minimum age for inmates was about eighty

Walking more and more slowly as he approached the dwelling he had once
thought of as home he became aware of a little girl in a checkered
dress approaching him at a gait varied by the indifferent behavior of
a barrelhoop which she was disciplining with a stick held in her
right hand When the hoop behaved well she came ahead rapidly when it
affected to be intoxicated which was most often its whim she zigzagged
with it and gained little ground But all the while and without
reference to what went on concerning the hoop she slowly and
continuously fed herself with her left hand small solemnly relished
bites of a slice of breadandbutter covered with apple sauce and
powdered sugar

Mr Parcher looked upon her and he shivered slightly for he knew her
to be Willie Baxters sister

Unaware of the emotion she produced in him Jane checked her hoop and
halted

Gd afternoon Mister Parcher she said gravely

Good afternoon he returned without much spirit

Jane looked up at him trustfully and with a strange unconscious
fondness You goin home now Mr Parcher she asked turning to
walk at his side She had suspended the hoop over her left arm and
transferred the breadandbutter and apple sauce and sugar to her right
so that she could eat even more conveniently than before

I suppose so he murmured

My brother Willies been at your house all afternoon she remarked

He repeated I suppose so but in a tone which combined the vocal
tokens of misery and of hopeless animosity

He just went home said Jane I was cross the street from your
house but I guess he didnt see me He kept lookin back at your house
Miss Pratt was on the porch

I suppose so This time it was a moan

Jane proceeded to give him some information My brother Willie isnt
comin back to your house tonight but he doesnt know it yet

What exclaimed Mr Parcher

Willie isnt goin to spend any more evenings at your house at all
said Jane thoughtfully He isnt but he doesnt know it yet

Mr Parcher gazed fixedly at the wonderful child and something like
a ray of sunshine flickered over his seamed and harried face Are you
SURE he isnt he said What makes you think so

I know he isnt said demure Jane Its on account of somepm I told
mamma

And upon this a gentle glow began to radiate throughout Mr Parcher A
new feeling budded within his bosom he was warmly attracted to Jane
She was evidently a child to be cherished and particularly to be
encouraged in the line of conduct she seemed to have adopted He wished
the Bullitt and Watson families each had a little girl like this Still
if what she said of William proved true much had been gained and life
might be tolerable after all

Hell come in the afternoons I guess said Jane But you arent
home then Mr Parcher except late like you were that day of the
Sundayschool class It was on account of what you said that day I told
mamma

Told your mamma what

What you said

Mr Parchers perplexity continued What about

About Willie YOU know Jane smiled fraternally

No I dont

It was when I was layin in the liberry that day of the Sundayschool
class Jane told him You an Mrs Parcher was talkin in there about
Miss Pratt an Willie an everything

Good heavens Mr Parcher summoning his memory had placed the
occasion and Jane together Did you HEAR all that

Yes Jane nodded I told mamma all what you said

Murder

Well said Jane I guess its good I did because lookthats the
very reason mamma did somepm sos he cant come any more except in
daytime I guess she thought Willie oughtnt to behave sost you said
so many things about him like that so today she did somepm an now
he cant come any more to behave that loving way of Miss Pratt that you
said you would be in the lunatic asylum if he didnt quit But he hasnt
found it out yet

Found what out please asked Mr Parcher feeling more affection for
Jane every moment

He hasnt found out he cant come back to your house tonight an he
cant come back tomorrow night nor dayaftertomorrow night nor

Is it because your mamma is going to tell him he cant

No Mr Parcher Mamma says hes too oldan she said she didnt like
to anyway She just DID somepm

What What did she do

Its a secret said Jane I could tell you the first part of itup
to where the secret begins I expect

Do Mr Parcher urged

Well its about somepm Willies been WEARIN Jane began moving
closer to him as they slowly walked onward I cant tell you what they
were because thats the secretbut he had em on him every evening
when he came to see Miss Pratt but they belong to papa an papa
doesnt know a word about it Well one evening papa wanted to put em
on because he had a right to Mr Parcher an Willie didnt have any
right to at all but mamma couldnt find em an she rummidged an
rummidged most all next day an pretty near every day since then an
never did find em until dont you believe I saw Willie inside of em
only last night He was startin over to your house to see Miss Pratt in
em So I told mamma an she said it d haf to be a secret so thats
why I cant tell you what they were Well an then this afternoon
early I was with her an she said long as I had told her the secret
in the first place I could come in Willies room with her an we both
were already in there anyway cause I was kind of thinkin maybe shed
go in there to look for em Mr Parcher

I see he said admiringly I see

Well they were under Willies windowseat all folded up an mamma
said she wondered what she better do an she was worried because she
didnt like to have Willie behave sos you an Mrs Parcher thought that
way about him So she said thethe secretwhat Willie wears you
know but theyre really papas an arent Willies any moren theyre
MINEwell she said the secret was gettin a little teeny bit too tight
for papa but she guessed theyI mean the secretshe said she guessed
it was already pretty loose for Willie so she wrapped it up an I
went with her an we took em to a tailor an she told him to make em
bigger for a surprise for papa cause then theyll fit him again Mr
Parcher She said he must make em a whole lot bigger She said he must
let em way WAY out So I guess Willie would look too funny in em
after theyre fixed an anyway Mr Parcher the secret wont be home
from the tailors for two weeks an maybe by that time Miss Prattll be
gone

They had reached Mr Parchers gate he halted and looked down fondly
upon this child who seemed to have read his soul Do you honestly think
so he asked

Well anyway Mr Parcher said Jane mamma saidwell she said
shes sure Willie wouldnt come here in the evening any more when YOUre
at home Mr Parchercause after hed been wearin the secret every
night this way he wouldnt like to come and not have the secret on
Mamma said the reason he would feel like that was because he was
seventeen years old An she isnt goin to tell him anything about it
Mr Parcher She said thats the best way

Her new friend nodded and seemed to agree I suppose thats what you
meant when you said he wasnt coming back but didnt know it yet

Yes Mr Parcher

He rested an elbow upon the gatepost gazing down with everincreasing
esteem Of course I know your last name he said but Im afraid Ive
forgotten your other one

Its Jane

Jane said Mr Parcher I should like to do something for you

Jane looked down and with eyes modestly lowered she swallowed the last
fragment of the breadandbutter and apple sauce and sugar which had
been the constantly evanescent companion of their little walk together
She was not mercenary she had sought no reward

Well I guess I must run home she said And with one lift of her
eyes to his and a shy laughlaughter being a rare thing for Janeshe
scampered quickly to the corner and was gone

But though she cared for no reward the extraordinary restlessness of
William that evening after dinner must at least have been of great
interest to her He ascended to his own room directly from the table
but about twenty minutes later came down to the library where Jane
was sitting her privilege until half after seven with her father and
mother William looked from one to the other of his parents and seemed
about to speak but did not do so Instead he departed for the upper
floor again and presently could be heard moving about energetically in
various parts of the house a remote thump finally indicating that he
was doing something with a trunk in the attic

After that he came down to the library again and once more seemed about
to speak but did not Then he went upstairs again and came down
again and he was still repeating this process when Janes timelimit
was reached and she repaired conscientiously to her little bed Her
mother came to hear her prayers and to turn out the light andwhen
Mrs Baxter had passed out into the hall after that Jane heard
her speaking to William who was now conducting what seemed to be
excavations on a serious scale in his own room

Oh Willie perhaps I didnt tell you butyou remember Id been
missing papas evening clothes and looking everywhere for days and
days

Yees huskily from William

Well I found them And where do you suppose Id put them I found
them under your windowseat Can you think of anything more absurd than
putting them there and then forgetting it I took them to the tailors
to have them let out They were getting too tight for papa but theyll
be all right for him when the tailor sends them back

What the stricken William gathered from this it is impossible to state
with accuracy probably he mixed some perplexity with his emotions
Certainly he was perplexed the following evening at dinner

Jane did not appear at the table Poor child shes sick in bed Mrs
Baxter explained to her husband I was out this afternoon and she ate
nearly ALL of a fivepound box of candy

Both the sadeyed William and his father were dumfounded Where on
earth did she get a fivepound box of candy Mr Baxter demanded

Im afraid Jane has begun her first affair said Mrs Baxter A
gentleman sent it to her

What gentleman gasped William

And in his mothers eyes as they slowly came to rest on his in reply
he was aware of an inscrutability strongly remindful of that inscrutable
look of Janes

Mr Parcher she said gently




XII

PROGRESS OF THE SYMPTOMS

Mrs BAXTERS little stroke of diplomacy had gone straight to the mark
she was a woman of insight For every reason she was well content to
have her son spend his evenings at home though it cannot be claimed
that his presence enlivened the household his condition being one of
strange trancelike irascibility Evening after evening passed while
he sat dreaming painfully of Mr Parchers porch but in the daytime
though William did not literally make hay while the sun shone he at
least gathered a harvest somewhat resembling hay in general character

Thus

One afternoon having locked his door to secure himself against
intrusion on the part of his mother or Jane William seated himself at
his writingtable and from a drawer therein took a small cardboard box
which he uncovered placing the contents in view before him upon the
table How meager how chilling a word is contents In the box were

A faded rose

Several other faded roses disintegrated into leaves

Three withered fourleaf clovers

A white ribbon still faintly smelling of violets

A small silver shoebuckle

A large pearl button

A small pearl button

A tortoiseshell hairpin

A crosssection from the heel of a small slipper

A stringy remnant probably once an improvised wreath of daisies

Four or five withered dandelions

Other dried vegetation of a nature now indistinguishable

William gazed reverently upon this junk of precious souvenirs then
from the inner pocket of his coat he brought forth warm and crumpled
a lumpish cluster of red geranium blossoms still aromatic and not quite
dead though naturally after three hours of such intimate confinement
they wore an unmistakable look of suffering With a tenderness which
his family had never observed in him since that piteous day in his fifth
year when he tried to mend his broken doll William laid the geranium
blossoms in the cardboard box among the botanical and other relics

His gentle eyes showed what the treasures meant to him and yet it
was strange that they should have meant so much because the source of
supply was not more than a quarter of a mile distant and practically
inexhaustible Miss Pratt had now been a visitor at the Parchers
for something less than five weeks but she had made no mention of
prospective departure and there was every reason to suppose that she
meant to remain all summer And as any foliage or anything whatever that
she touched or that touched her was thenceforth suitable for Williams
museum there appeared to be some probability that autumn might see it
so enlarged as to lack that rarity in the component items which is the
underlying value of most collections

Williams writingtable was beside an open window through which came an
insistent whirring unagreeable to his mood and looking down upon the
sunny lawn he beheld three lowly creatures One was Genesis he was
cutting the grass Another was Clematis he had assumed a transient
attitude curiously triangular in order to scratch his ear the while
his anxious eyes never wavered from the third creature

This was Jane In one hand she held a little stack of sugarsprinkled
wafers which she slowly but steadily depleted unconscious of the
increasingly earnest protest at last nearing agony in the eyes of
Clematis Wearing unaccustomed garments of fashion and festivity
Jane stood in speckless starchy white and a blue sash watching
the lawnmower spout showers of grass as the powerful Genesis easily
propelled it along over lapping lanes back and forth across the yard

From a height of illimitable loftiness the owner of the cardboard
treasury looked down upon the squat commonplaceness of those three
lives The condition of Jane and Genesis and Clematis seemed almost
laughably pitiable to him the more so because they were unaware of it
They breathed not the starry air that William breathed but what did it
matter to them The wretched things did not even know that they meant
nothing to Miss Pratt

Clematis found his ear too pliable for any great solace from his foot
but he was not disappointed he had expected little and his thoughts
were elsewhere Rising he permitted his nose to follow his troubled
eyes with the result that it touched the rim of the last wafer in
Janes external possession

This incident annoyed William Look there he called from the window
You mean to eat that cake after the dogs had his face on it

Jane remained placid It wasnt his face

Well if it wasnt his face Id like to know what

It wasnt his face Jane repeated It was his nose It wasnt all of
his nose touched it either It was only a little outside piece of his
nose

Well are you going to eat that cake I ask you

Jane broke off a small bit of the wafer She gave the bit to Clematis
and slowly ate what remained continuing to watch Genesis and apparently
unconscious of the scorching gaze from the window

I never saw anything as disgusting as long as Ive lived William
announced I wouldnt a believed it if anybodyd told me a sister of
mine would eat after

I didnt said Jane I like Clematis anyway

Ye gods her brother cried Do you think that makes it any better
And BY the WAY he continued in a tone of even greater severity Id
a like to know where you got those cakes Whered you get em Id just
like to inquire

In the pantry Jane turned and moved toward the house Im goin in
for some more now

William uttered a cry these little cakes were sacred His mother
growing curious to meet a visiting lady of whom so to speak she had
heard much and thought more had asked May Parcher to bring her guest
for iced tea that afternoon A few others of congenial age had been
invited there was to be a small matinee in fact for the honor and
pleasure of the son of the house and the cakes of Janes onslaught
were part of Mrs Baxters preparations There was no telling where
Jane would stop it was conceivable that Miss Pratt herself might go
waferless

William returned the cardboard box to its drawer with reverent haste
then increasing the haste but dropping the reverence he hied himself
to the pantry with such advantage of longer legs that within the minute
he and the wafers appeared in conjunction before his mother who was
arranging fruit and flowers upon a table in the livingroom

William entered in the stainedglass attitude of one bearing gifts
Overhead both hands supported a tin pan well laden with small
cakes and wafers for which Jane was silently but repeatedly and
systematically jumping Even under the stress of these efforts her
expression was cool and collected she maintained the selfpossession
that was characteristic of her

Not so with William his cheeks were flushed his eyes indignant You
see what this child is doing he demanded Are you going to let her
ruin everything

Ruin Mrs Baxter repeated absently refreshing with fair water a
bowl of flowers upon the table Ruin

Yes ruin William was hotly emphatic If you dont do something with
her it ll all be ruined before Miss Pr before they even get here

Mrs Baxter laughed Set the pan down Willie

Set it DOWN he echoed incredulously With that child in the room and
grabbing like

There Mrs Baxter took the pan from him placed it upon a chair and
with the utmost coolness selected five wafers and gave them to Jane
Id already promised her she could have five more You know the doctor
said Janes digestion was the finest hed ever misunderstood They wont
hurt her at all Willie

This deliberate misinterpretation of his motives made it difficult for
William to speak Do YOU think he began hoarsely do you THINK

Theyre so small too Mrs Baxter went on SHE probably wouldnt be
sick if she ate them all

My heavens he burst forth Do you think I was worrying about He
broke off unable to express himself save by a few gestures of despair
Again finding his voice and a great deal of it he demanded Do you
realize that Miss PRATT will be here within less than half an hour What
do you suppose shed think of the people of this town if she was invited
out expecting decent treatment and found twothirds of the cakes eaten
up before she got there and what was left of em all mauled and pawed
over and crummy and chewedup lookin from some wretched CHILD Here
William became oratorical but not with marked effect since Jane
regarded him with unmoved eyes while Mrs Baxter continued to be mildly
preoccupied in arranging the table In fact throughout this episode
in controversy the ladies party had not only the numerical but the
emotional advantage Obviously the approach of Miss Pratt was not to
them what it was to William I tell you he declaimedyes I tell
you that it wouldnt take much of this kind of thing to make Miss Pratt
think the people of this town werewell it wouldnt take much to make
her think the people of this town hadnt learned much of how to
behave in society and were pretty uncilivized He corrected himself
Uncivilized And to think Miss Pratt has to find that out in MY house
To think

Now Willie said Mrs Baxter gently youd better go up and brush
your hair again before your friends come You mustnt let yourself get
so excited

Excited he cried incredulously Do you think Im EXCITED
Ye gods He smote his hands together and in his despair of her
intelligence would have flung himself down upon a chair but was
arrested halfway by simultaneous loud outcries from his mother and
Jane

Dont sit on the CAKES they both screamed

Saving himself and the pan of wafers by a supreme contortion at the last
instant William decided to remain upon his feet What do I care for
the cakes he demanded contemptuously beginning to pace the floor
Its the question of principle Im talking about Do you think its
right to give the people of this town a poor name when strangers like
Miss PRATT come to vis

Willie His mother looked at him hopelessly Do go and brush your
hair If you could see how youve tousled it you would

He gave her a dazed glance and strode from the room

Jane looked after him placidly Didnt he talk funny she murmured

Yes dear said Mrs Baxter She shook her head and uttered the
enigmatic words They do

I mean Willie mamma said Jane If its anything about Miss Pratt
he always talks awful funny Dont you think Willie talks awful funny if
its anything about Miss Pratt mamma

Yes but

What mamma Jane asked as her mother paused

Wellit happens People do get like that at his age Jane

Does everybody

No I suppose not everybody Just some

Janes interest was roused Well do those that do mamma she
inquired do they all act like Willie

No said Mrs Baxter Thats the trouble you cant tell whats
coming

Jane nodded I think I know she said You mean Willie

William himself interrupted her He returned violently to the doorway
his hair still tousled and standing upon the threshold said sternly

What is that child wearing her best dress for

Willie Mrs Baxter cried Go brush your hair

I wish to know what that child is all dressed up for he insisted

To please you Dont you want her to look her best at your tea

I thought that was it he cried and upon this confirmation of his
worst fears he did increased violence to his rumpled hair I suspected
it but I wouldnt a believed it You mean to let this childyou
mean to let Here his agitation affected his throat and his utterance
became clouded A few detached phrases fell from him Invite MY
friendschildrens partyye godsthink Miss Pratt plays dolls

Jane will be very good his mother said I shouldnt think of not
having her Willie and you neednt bother about your friends theyll
be very glad to see her They all know her except Miss Pratt perhaps
and Mrs Baxter paused then she asked absently By the way
havent I heard somewhere that she likes pretending to be a little girl
herself

WHAT

Yes said Mrs Baxter remaining calm Im sure Ive heard somewhere
that she likes to talk babytalk

Upon this a tremor passed over William after which he became rigid
You ask a lady to your house he began and even before she gets
here before youve even seen her you pass judgment upon one of
theone of the noblest

Good gracious _I_ havent passed judgment If she does talk
babytalk I imagine she does it very prettily and Im sure Ive
no objection And if she does do it why should you be insulted by my
mentioning it

It was the way you said it he informed her icily

Good gracious I just said it Mrs Baxter laughed and then
probably a little out of patience with him she gave way to that innate
mischievousness in such affairs which is not unknown to her sex You
see Willie if she pretends to be a cunning little girl it will be
helpful to Jane to listen and learn how

William uttered a cry he knew that he was struck but he was not sure
how or where He was left with a blank mind and no repartee Again he
dashed from the room

In the hall near the open front door he came to a sudden halt
and Mrs Baxter and Jane heard him calling loudly to the industrious
Genesis

Here You go cut the grass in the back yard and for Heavens sake
take that dog with you

Grass awready cut roun back responded the amiable voice of Genesis
while the lawnmower ceased not to whir Cut all at back yod s
mawnin

Well you cant cut the front yard now Go around in the back yard and
take that dog with you

Nemmine bout at back yod Ole Clem ain trouble nobody

You hear what I tell you William shouted You do what I say and you
do it quick

Genesis laughed gaily I got my grass to cut

You decline to do what I command you William roared

Yes indeedy Who pay me my wages Ats MY boss You ma say
Genesis you git all at lawn mowed bfo sundown No suh Neen
wase you bref on me cause Im got all MY time good an took up

Once more William presented himself fatefully to his mother and Jane
May I just kindly ask you to look out in the front yard

Im familiar with it Willie Mrs Baxter returned a little wearily

I mean I want you to look at Genesis

Im familiar with his appearance too she said Why in the world do
you mind his cutting the grass

William groaned Do you honestly want guests coming to this house
to see that awful old darky out there and know that HES the kind of
servants we employ Ye gods

Why Genesis is just a neighborhood outdoors darky Willie he works
for half a dozen families besides us Everybody in this part of town
knows him

Yes he cried but a lady that didnt live here wouldnt Ye gods
What do you suppose she WOULD think You know what hes got on

Its a sort of sleeveless jersey he wears Willie I think

No you DONT think that he cried with great bitterness You know
its not a jersey You know perfectly well what it is and yet you
expect to keep him out there whenwhen one of the one of the noblwhen
my friends arrive And theyll think thats our DOG out there wont
they When intelligent people come to a house and see a dog sitting out
in front they think its the family in the houses dog dont they
Williams condition becoming more and more disordered he paced the
room while his agony rose to a climax Ye gods What do you think Miss
Pratt will think of the people of this town when shes invited to meet
a few of my friends and the first thing she sees is a nigger in his
undershirt What ll she think when she finds that childs eaten up half
the food and the people have to explain that the dog in the front
yard belongs to the darky He interrupted himself with a groan And
probly she wouldnt believe it Anybodyd SAY they didnt own a dog
like that And thats what you want her to see before she even gets
inside the house Instead of a regular gardener in livery like we ought
to have and a bulldog or a good Airedale or a foxhound or something
the first things you want intelligent people from out of town to see are
that awful old darky and his mongrel scratchin fleas and like as not
lettin em get on other people THATd be nice wouldnt it Go out to
tea expecting decent treatment and get fl

WILLIE

Mrs Baxter managed to obtain his attention If youll go and brush
your hair Ill send Genesis and Clematis away for the rest of the
afternoon And then if you ll sit down quietly and try to keep cool
until your friends get here Ill

Quietly he echoed shaking his head over this mystery Im the
only one that IS quiet around here Things d be in a fine condition to
receive guests if I didnt keep pretty cool I guess

There there she said soothingly Go and brush your hair And
change your collar Willie its all wilted Ill send Genesis away

His wandering eye failed to meet hers with any intelligence Collar
he muttered as if in soliloquy Collar

Change it said Mrs Baxter raising her voice Its WILTED

He departed in a dazed manner

Passing through the hall he paused abruptly his eye having fallen
with sudden disapproval upon a large heavily framed glasscovered
engraving The Battle of Gettysburg which hung upon the wall near
the front door Undeniably it was a picture feeble in decorative
quality no doubt too William was right in thinking it as unworthy of
Miss Pratt as were Jane and Genesis and Clematis He felt that she must
never see it especially as the frame had been chipped and had a corner
broken but it was more pleasantly effective where he found it than
where in his nervousness he left it A few hasty jerks snapped the
elderly green cords by which it was suspended then he laid the picture
upon the floor and with his handkerchief made a curious labyrinth
of avenues in the large oblong area of fine dust which this removal
disclosed upon the wall Pausing to wipe his hot brow with the same
implement he remembered that some one had made allusions to his collar
and hair whereupon he sprang to the stairs mounted two at a time
rushed into his own room and confronted his streaked image in the
mirror




XIII

AT HOME TO HIS FRIENDS

After ablutions he found his wet hair plastic and easily obtained the
long even sweep backward from the brow lacking which no male person
unless bald fulfilled his definition of a man of the world But
there ensued a period of vehemence and activity caused by a bent
collarbutton which went on strike with a desperation that was
downright savage The day was warm and William was warmer moisture
bedewed him afresh Belated victory no sooner arrived than he perceived
a fatal dimpling of the new collar and was forced to begin the
operation of exchanging it for a successor Another exchange however
he unfortunately forgot to make the handkerchief with which he had
wiped the wall remained in his pocket

Voices from below making polite laughter warned him that already some
of the bidden party had arrived and as he completed the fastening of
his third consecutive collar an ecstasy of sound reached him through
the open windowand then Oh then his breath behaved in an abnormal
manner and he began to tremble It was the voice of Miss Pratt no less

He stopped for one heartstruck look from his casement All in fluffy
white and heliotrope she wasa blonde rapture floating over the
sidewalk toward Williams front gate Her little white cottony dog with
a heliotrope ribbon round his neck bobbed his head over her cuddling
arm a heliotrope parasol shielded her infinitesimally from the amorous
sun Poor William

Two youths entirely in Williams condition of heart accompanied the
glamorous girl and hung upon her roseleaf lips while Miss Parcher
appeared dimly upon the outskirts of the group the wellknown penalty
for hostesses who entertain such radiance Probably it serves them
right

To Williams reddening ear Miss Pratts voice came clearly as the
chiming of tiny bells for she spoke whimsically to her little dog in
that tinkling childlike fashion which was part of the spell she cast

Darlin Flopit she said wake up Oo tummin to teapotty wiz all de
drowedups Peshus Flopit wake up

Dizzy with enchantment half suffocated his heart melting within him
William turned from the angelic sounds and fairy vision of the window
He ran out of the room and plunged down the front stairs And the next
moment the crash of breaking glass and the loud thumpbump of a heavily
falling human body resounded through the house

Mrs Baxter alarmed quickly excused herself from the teatable round
which were gathered four or five young people and hastened to the front
hall followed by Jane Through the open door were seen Miss Pratt Miss
Parcher Mr Johnnie Watson and Mr Joe Bullitt coming leisurely up the
sunny front walk laughing and unaware of the catastrophe which had just
occurred within the shadows of the portal And at a little distance from
the foot of the stairs William was seated upon the prostrate Battle of
Gettysburg

It slid he said hoarsely I carried it upstairs with mehe
believed thisand somebody brought it down and left it lying flat on
the floor by the bottom step on purpose to trip me I stepped on it and
it slid He was in a state of shock it seemed important to impress
upon his mother the fact that the picture had not remained firmly in
place when he stepped upon it It SLID I tell you

Get up Willie she urged under her breath and as he summoned
enough presence of mind to obey she beheld ruins other than the wrecked
engraving She stifled a cry WILLIE Did the glass cut you

He felt himself Nom

It did your trousers Youll have to change them Hurry

Some of Williams normal faculties were restored to him by one hasty
glance at the back of his left leg which had a dismantled appearance A
long blue strip of cloth hung there with white showing underneath

HURRY said Mrs Baxter And hastily gathering some fragments of
glass she dropped them upon the engraving pushed it out of the way
and went forward to greet Miss Pratt and her attendants

As for William he did not even pause to close his mouth but fled with
it open Upward he sped unseen and came to a breathless halt upon the
landing at the top of the stairs

As it were in a dream he heard his mothers hospitable greetings at the
door and then the little party lingered in the hall detained by Miss
Pratts discovery of Jane

Oh tweetums tootums ickle dirl he heard the ravishing voice exclaim
Oh tootums ickle blue sash

It cost a dollar and eightynine cents said Jane Willie sat on the
cakes

Oh no he didnt Mrs Baxter laughed He didnt QUITE

He had to go upstairs said Jane And as the stricken listener above
smote his forehead she added placidly He tore a hole in his cloes

She seemed about to furnish details her mood being communicative but
Mrs Baxter led the way into the livingroom the hall was vacated
and only the murmur of voices and laughter reached William What
descriptive information Jane may have added was spared his hearing
which was a mercy

And yet it may be that he could not have felt worse than he did for
there IS nothing worse than to be seventeen and to hear one of the
Noblest girls in the world told by a little child that you sat on the
cakes and tore a hole in your cloes

William leaned upon the banister railing and thought thoughts about
Jane For several long seething moments he thought of her exclusively
Then spurred by the loud laughter of rivals and the agony of knowing
that even in his own house they were monopolizing the attention of one
of the Noblest he hastened into his own room and took account of his
reverses

Standing with his back to the mirror he obtained over his shoulder
a view of his trousers which caused him to break out in a fresh
perspiration Again he wiped his forehead with the handkerchief and the
result was instantly visible in the mirror

The air thickened with sounds of frenzy followed by a torrential roar
and great sputterings in a bathroom which tumult subsiding William
returned at a tragic gallop to his room and having removed his
trousers began a feverish examination of the garments hanging in a
clothescloset There were two pairs of flannel trousers which would
probably again be white and possible when cleaned and pressed but a
glance showed that until then they were not to be considered as even
the last resort of desperation Beside them hung his last years summer
suit of light gray

Feverishly he brought it forth threw off his coat and thendeflected
by another glance at the mirrorbegan to change his collar again
This was obviously necessary and to quicken the process he decided
to straighten the bent collarbutton Using a shoehorn as a lever
he succeeded in bringing the little cap or head of the button into its
proper plane but unfortunately his final effort dislodged the cap
from the rod between it and the base and it flew off malignantly
into space Here was a calamity few things are more useless than a
decapitated collarbutton and William had no other He had made
sure that it was his last before he put it on that day also he
had ascertained that there was none in on or about his fathers
dressingtable Finally in the possession of neither William nor his
father was there a shirt with an indigenous collar

For decades collarbuttons have been on the handmedown shelves of
humor it is a mistake in the catalogue They belong to pathos They
have done harm in the world and there have been collarbuttons that
failed when the destinies of families hung upon them There have
been collarbuttons that thwarted proper matings There have been
collarbuttons that bore last hopes and falling to the floor
NEVER were found Williams broken collarbutton was really the only
collarbutton in the house except such as were engaged in serving his
male guests below

At first he did not realize the extent of his misfortune How could he
Fate is always expected to deal its great blows in the grand manner
But our expectations are fustian spangled with pinchbeck we look for
tragedy to be theatrical Meanwhile every day before our eyes fate
works on employing for its instruments the infinitesimal the ignoble
and the pettyin a word collarbuttons

Of course William searched his dressingtable and his fathers although
he had been thoroughly over both once before that day Next he went
through most of his mothers and Janes accessories to the
toilette through trinketboxes gloveboxes hairpinboxes
handkerchiefcaseseven through sewingbaskets Utterly he convinced
himself that ladies not only use no collarbuttons but also never pick
them up and put them away among their own belongings How much time he
consumed in this search is difficult to reckonit is almost impossible
to believe that there is absolutely no collarbutton in a house

And what Williams state of mind had become is matter for exorbitant
conjecture Jane arriving at his locked door upon an errand was bidden
by a thick unnatural voice to depart

Mamma says What in mercys name is the matter Jane called She
whispered to me Go an see what in mercys name is the matter with
Willie an if the glass cut him after all an why dont he come
down an why dont you Willie Were all havin the nicest time

You gway said the strange voice within the room Gway

Well did the glass cut you

No Keep quiet Gway

Well are you EVER comin down to your party

Yes I am Gway

Jane obeyed and William somehow completed the task upon which he was
engaged Genius had burst forth from his despair necessity had become
a mother again and Williams collar was in place It was tied there
Under his necktie was a piece of string

He had lost count of time but he was frantically aware of its passage
agony was in the thought of so many rich moments frittered away
upstairs while Joe Bullitt and Johnnie Watson made hay below And
there was another spur to haste in his fear that the behavior of Mrs
Baxter might not be all that the guest of honor would naturally expect
of Williams mother As for Jane his mind filled with dread shivers
passed over him at intervals

It was a dismal thing to appear at a party and that his own in last
summers suit but when he had hastily put it on and faced the mirror
he felt a little betterfor three or four seconds Then he turned to
see how the back of it looked

And collapsed in a chair moaning




XIV

TIME DOES FLY

He remembered now what he had been too hurried to remember earlier He
had worn these clothes on the previous Saturday and returning from a
glorified walk with Miss Pratt he had demonstrated a fact to which his
neardemolition of the wafers this afternoon was additional testimony
This fact roughly stated is that a person of seventeen in love is
liable to sit down anywhere William had dreamily seated himself upon
a tabouret in the library without noticing that Jane had left her open
paintbox there Jane had just been painting sunsets naturally all the
little blocks of color were wet and the effect upon Williams palegray
trousers was marvelousfar beyond the capacity of his coat to conceal
Collarbuttons and childrens paintboxesthose are the trolls that lie
in wait

The gray clothes and the flannel trousers had been destined for the
professional cleaner and William rousing himself from a brief stupor
made a piteous effort to substitute himself for that expert so far
as the gray trousers were concerned He divested himself of them and
brought water towels bathsoap and a rubber bathsponge to the bright
light of his window and there with touching courage and persistence
he tried to scrub the paint out of the cloth He obtained cloud studies
and marines which would have interested a PostImpressionist but upon
trousers they seemed out of place

There came one seeking and calling him again raps sounded upon the
door which he had not forgotten to lock

Willie said a serious voice mamma wants to know what in mercys
name is the matter She wants to know if you know for mercys name what
time it is She wants to know what in mercys name you think theyre all
goin to think She says

GWAY

Well she said I had to find out what in mercys name youre doin
Willie

You tell her he shouted hoarselytell her Im playin dominoes
Whats she THINK Im doin

I guessJane paused evidently to complete the swallowing of
somethingI guess she thinks youre goin crazy I dont like Miss
Pratt but she lets me play with that little dog Its names Flopit

You go way from that door and stop bothering me said William I got
enough on my mind

Mamma looks at Miss Pratt Jane remarked Miss Pratt puts cakes in
that Mr Bullitts mouth and Johnnie Watsons mouth too Shes awful

William made it plain that these bulletins from the party found no favor
with him He bellowed If you dont get away from that DOOR

Jane was interested in the conversation but felt that it would be
better to return to the refreshmenttable There she made use of her own
conception of a whisper to place before her mother a report which was
considered interesting and even curious by every one present though
such was the courtesy of the little assembly there was a general
pretense of not hearing

I told him thus whispered Jane an he said You gway from that
door or Ill do somepmhe didnt say what mamma He said What you
think Im doin Im playin dominoes He didnt mean he WAS playin
dominoes mamma He just said he was I think maybe he was just lookin
in the lookinglass some more

Mrs Baxter was becoming embarrassed She resolved to go to Williams
room herself at the first opportunity but for some time her
conscientiousness as a hostess continued to occupy her at the table
and then when she would have gone Miss Pratt detained her by a roguish
appeal to make Mr Bullitt and Mr Watson behave Both refused all
nourishment except such as was placed in their mouths by the delicate
hand of one of the Noblest and the latter said that really she wanted
to eat a little tweetie now and then herself and not to spend her whole
time feeding the Men For Miss Pratt had the same playfulness with older
people that she had with those of her own age and she elaborated her
pretended quarrel with the two young gentlemen taking others of the
dazzled company into her confidence about it and insisting upon Mamma
Batsters acting formally as judge to settle the difficulty However
having thus arranged matters Miss Pratt did not resign the center of
interest but herself proposed a compromise she would continue to feed
Mr Bullitt and Mr Watson every other tweetiethat is each must
agree to eat a cake all by him own self after every cake fed to him
So the comedietta went on to the running accompaniment of laughter
with Mr Bullitt and Mr Watson swept by such gusts of adoration they
were like to perish where they sat But Mrs Baxters smiling approval
was beginning to be painful to the muscles of her face for it was
hypocritical And if William had known her thoughts about one of the
Noblest he could only have attributed them to that demon of groundless
prejudice which besets all females but most particularly and
outrageously the mothers and sisters of Men

A colored servingmaid entered with a laden tray and having disposed
of its freight of bonbons among the guests spoke to Mrs Baxter in a
low voice

Could you manage step in the back hall a minute please maam

Mrs Baxter managed and having closed the door upon the laughing
voices asked quicklyWhat is it Adelia Have you seen Mr William
Do you know why he doesnt come down

Yesm said Adelia He gone mighty near out his head Miz Baxter

What

Yesm He come floppin down the back stairs in his bafrobe lil
while ago He jes gone up again He aint got no britches Miz
Baxter

No WHAT

Nom said Adelia He aint got no britches at all

A statement of this kind is startling under Almost any circumstances
and it is unusually so when made in reference to a person for whom a
party is being given Therefore it was not unreasonable of Mrs Baxter
to lose her breath

Butit cant BE she gasped He has He has plenty

Nom he aint Adelia assured her An hes carryin on so I dont
scarcely think he knows much what hes doin Miz Baxter He brung down
some gray britches to the kitchen to see if I couldn press an clean
em right quick they was the ones Miss Jane when shes paintin all
them sunsets lef her paintbox open an one them sunsets got on these
here gray britches Miz Baxter an honesly Miz Baxter hes fixed em
in a condishum tryin to git that paint out I dont believe it ll be
no use sendin em to the cleaner Clean em an press em QUICK I
says I couldn clean em by Resurreckshum let alone pressin em
Nom Well he had his blue britches too but theys so ripped an tore
an kind o shredded away in one place the cook she jes hollered when
he spread em out an he didn even ast me could I mend em An he had
two pairs o them white flannen britches but honesly Miz Baxter
I dont scarcely think Genesis would wear em the way they is now
Well I says aint but one thing lef to do _I_ can see I says
Why dont you go put on that nice black suit you had las winter

Of course Mrs Baxter cried Ill go and

Nom said Adelia You don need to Hes up in the attic now
rarin roun mongs them trunks but seem to me like I remember you
put that suit away under the heavy blankets in that big cedar ches with
the padlock If you jes tell me where is the key I take it up to him

Under the bureau in the spare room said Mrs Baxter HURRY

Adelia hurried and fifteen minutes later William for the last time
that afternoon surveyed himself in his mirror His face showed the
strain that had been upon him and under which he still labored the
black suit was a map of creases and William was perspiring more freely
than ever under the heavy garments But at least he was clothed

He emptied his pockets disgorging upon the floor a multitude of small
white spheres like marbles Then as he stepped out into the hall he
discovered that their odor still remained about him so he stopped
and carefully turned his pockets inside out one after the other but
finding that he still smelled vehemently of the mothballs though not
one remained upon him he went to his mothers room and sprinkled violet
toiletwater upon his chest and shoulders He disliked such odors but
that left by the mothballs was intolerable and laying hands upon a
canister labeled Hyacinth he contrived to pour a quantity of scented
powder inside his collar thence to be distributed by the force of
gravity so far as his dampness permitted

Lo William was now ready to go to his party Moist wilted smelling
indeed strangely he was ready

But when he reached the foot of the stairs he discovered that there was
one thing more to be done Indignation seized him and also a creeping
fear chilled his spine as he beheld a lurking shape upon the porch
stealthily moving toward the open door It was the lowly Clematis dog
unto Genesis

William instantly divined the purpose of Clematis It was debatable
whether Clematis had remained upon the premises after the departure of
Genesis or had lately returned thither upon some errand of his own
but one thing was certain and the manner of Clematishis attitude
his every look his every gesturemade it as clear as day Clematis
had discovered by one means or another the presence of Flopit in the
house and had determined to see him personally

Clematis wore his most misleading expression a stranger would have
thought him shy and easily turned from his purposebut William was not
deceived He knew that if Clematis meant to see Flopit a strong will
a ready brain and stern action were needed to thwart him but at all
costs that meeting must be prevented Things had been awful enough
without that

He was well aware that Clematis could not be driven away except
temporarily for nothing was further fixed upon Clematis than his habit
of retiring under pressure only to return and return again True the
door could have been shut in the intruders face but he would have
sought other entrance with possible success or failing that would
have awaited in the front yard the dispersal of the guests and Flopits
consequent emerging This was a contretemps not to be endured

The door of the livingroom was closed muffling festal noises and
permitting safe passage through the hall William cast a hunted look
over his shoulder then he approached Clematis

Good ole doggie he said huskily Hyuh Clem Hyuh Clem

Clematis moved sidelong retreating with his head low and his tail
denoting anxious thoughts

Hyuh Clem said William trying with only fair success to keep his
voice from sounding venomous Hyuh Clem

Clematis continued his deprecatory retreat

Thereupon William essayed a rusehe pretended to nibble at something
and then extended his hand as if it held forth a gift of food Look
Clem he said Yumyum Meat Clem Good meat

For once Clematis was half credulous He did not advance but he
elongated himself to investigate the extended hand and the next instant
found himself seized viciously by the scruff of the neck He submitted
to capture in absolute silence Only the slightest change of countenance
betrayed his mortification at having been found so easy a gull this
passed and a look of resolute stoicism took its place

He refused to walk but offered merely nominal resistance as a formal
protest which he wished to be of record though perfectly understanding
that it availed nothing at present William dragged him through the long
hall and down a short passageway to the cellar door This he opened
thrust Clematis upon the other side of it closed and bolted it

Immediately a stentorian howl raised bloodcurdling echoes and resounded
horribly through the house It was obvious that Clematis intended to
make a scene whether he was present at it or not He lifted his voice
in sonorous dolor stating that he did not like the cellar and would
continue thus to protest as long as he was left in it alone He added
that he was anxious to see Flopit and considered it an unexampled
outrage that he was withheld from the opportunity

Smitten with horror William reopened the door and charged down the
cellar stairs after Clematis who closed his caitiff mouth and gave way
precipitately He fled from one end of the cellar to the other and back
while William pursued choking and calling in low ferocious tones
Good doggie Good ole doggie Hyuh Clem Meat Clem meat

There was dodging through coalbins there was squirming between
barrels there was high jumping and broad jumping and there was a final
aspiring but baffled dash for the top of the cellar stairs where the
door forgotten by William stood open But it was here that Clematis
after a long and admirable exhibition of ingenuity no less than
agility submitted to capture That is to say finding himself
hopelessly pinioned he resumed the stoic

Grimly the panting and dripping William dragged him through the kitchen
where the cook cried out unintelligibly seeming to summon Adelia who
was not present Through the back yard went captor and prisoner the
latter now maintaining a seated posturehis pathetic conception of
dignity under duress Finally into a small shed or toolhouse behind
Mrs Baxters flowerbeds went Clematis in a hurried and spasmodic
manner The instant the door slammed he lifted his voiceand was bidden
to use it now as much as he liked

Adelia with a tray of used plates encountered the son of the house as
he passed through the kitchen on his return and her eyes were those of
one who looks upon miracles

William halted fiercely

Whats the matter he demanded Is my face dirty

You mean are it too dirty to go in yonduh to the party Adelia asked
slowly No suh you look all right to go in there You lookin jes
fine to go in there now Mist Willie

Something in her tone struck him as peculiar even as ominous but his
blood was uphe would not turn back now He strode into the hall and
opened the door of the livingroom

Jane was sitting on the floor busily painting sunsets in a large
blankbook which she had obtained for that exclusive purpose

She looked up brightly as William appeared in the doorway and in answer
to his wild gaze she said

I got a little bit sick so mamma told me to keep quiet a while Shes
lookin for you all over the house She told papa she dont know what in
mercys name people are goin to think about you Willie

The distraught youth strode to her The party he choked WHERE

They all stayed pretty long said Jane but the last ones said they
had to go home to their dinners when papa came a little while ago
Johnnie Watson was carryin Flopit for that Miss Pratt

William dropped into the chair beside which Jane had established herself
upon the floor Then he uttered a terrible cry and rose

Again Jane had painted a sunset she had not intended




XV

ROMANCE OF STATISTICS

On a warm morning ten days later William stood pensively among his
mothers flowerbeds behind the house his attitude denoting a low state
of vitality Not far away an aged negro sat upon a wheelbarrow in the
hot sun tremulously yet skilfully whittling a piece of wood into the
shape of a boat labor more to his taste evidently than that which he
had abandoned at the request of Jane Allusion to this preference for
a lighter task was made by Genesis who was erecting a trellis on the
border of the little garden

Pappy whittle all day he chuckled Whittle all night too Pappy I
thought you uz goin to git at long bed all spade up fer me by noon
Aint at what you tole me

You let him alone Genesis said Jane who sat by the old mans side
deeply fascinated Theres goin to be a great deal of rain in the next
few days maybe an I haf to have this boat ready

The aged darky lifted his streaky and diminished eyes to the burnished
sky and laughed Rain come some day anyways he said We git de
boat ready fo she fall dat sho His glance wandered to William and
rested upon him with feeble curiosity Dat ain yo pappy is it he
asked Jane

I should say it isnt she exclaimed Its Willie He was only
seventeen about two or three months ago Mr Genesis This was not the
old mans name but Jane had evolved it inspired by respect for one so
aged and so kind about whittling He was the father of Genesis and the
latter neither to her knowledge nor to her imagination possessed a
surname

I got catrack in my lef eye said Mr Genesis an de right one
she kine o tricksy too Tell black man fum white man little fum
big

Id hate it if he was papa said Jane confidentially Hes always
cross about somepm because hes in love She approached her mouth to
her whittling friends ear and continued in a whisper Hes in love of
Miss Pratt Shes out walkin with Joe Bullitt I was in the front yard
with Willie an we saw em go by Hes mad

William did not hear her Moodily he had discovered that there was
something amiss with the buckle of his belt and having ungirded
himself he was biting the metal tongue of the buckle in order
to straighten it This fell under the observation of Genesis who
remonstrated

You break you teef on at buckle he said

No I wont either William returned crossly

Ain my teef said Genesis Break em you want to

The attention of Mr Genesis did not seem to be attracted to the
speakers he continued his whittling in a craftsmanlike manner which
brought praise from Jane

You can see to whittle Mr Genesis she said You whittle better
than anybody in the world

I speck so mebbe Mr Genesis returned with a little complacency
How ole yo pappy

Oh hes OLD Jane explained

William deigned to correct her Hes not old hes middleaged

Well suh said Mr Genesis I had three chillum fo I uz twenty I
had two when I uz eighteem

William showed sudden interest You did he exclaimed How old were
you when you had the first one

I uz jes yo age said the old man I uz seventeem

By George cried William

Jane seemed much less impressed than William seventeen being a long way
from ten though of course to seventeen itself hardly any information
could be imagined as more interesting than that conveyed by the words
of the aged Mr Genesis The impression made upon William was obviously
profound and favorable

By George he cried again

Genesis he de youngis one said the old man Genesis he uz bawn
when I uz sixtyone

William moved closer What became of the one that was born when you
were seventeen he asked

Well suh said Mr Genesis I nev did know

At this Janes interest equaled Williams Her eyes consented to leave
the busy hands of the aged darky and much enlarged rose to his face
After a little pause of awe and sympathy she inquired

Was it a boy or a girl

The old man deliberated within himself Seem like it mus been a boy

Did it die Jane asked softly

I reckon it mus be dead by now he returned musingly Good many of
em dead what I KNOWS is dead Yesm I reckon so

How old were you when you were married William asked with a manner
of peculiar earnestnessit was the manner of one who addresses a
colleague

Me Well suh dat pens He seemed to search his memory I
rickalect I uz maied once in Looavle he said

Janes interest still followed the first child Was that where it was
born Mr Genesis she asked

He looked puzzled and paused in his whittling to rub his deeply
corrugated forehead Well suh mus been some bawn in Looavle
Genesis he called to his industrious son whaih uz YOU bawn

Right n is town laughed Genesis You fergit a good deal pappy
but I notice you don fergit come to meals

The old man grunted resuming his whittling busily Hain much use
he complained Cain eat nuffm lessen it all gruelly Man cain eat
nuffm lessen he got teef Genesis din I hyuh you tellin dis white
gemmun take caih his teefnot bite on no ion

William smiled in pity I dont need to bother about that I guess he
said I can crack nuts with my teeth

Yes suh said the old man You kin now Evy nut you crac now goin
cos you a yell when you git long bout fawty an fifty You crack nuts
now an youll holler den

Well I guess I wont worry myself much now about what wont happen
till Im forty or fifty said William My teeth ll last MY time I
guess

That brought a chuckle from Mr Genesis Jes listen he exclaimed
Young man think he ain nev goin be ole man Else he think Dat
ole man what Im goin to be dat ain goin be me talldat goin be
somebody else What I caih bout dat ole man I aint agoin take caih

been somebody else not me but I do jes wish I had him hyuh bout two
minuteslong enough to lam him fer not takin caih o my teef fer me
Yes suh

William laughed his good humor was restored and he found the
conversation of Mr Genesis attractive He seated himself upon an
upturned bucket near the wheelbarrow and reverted to a former theme
Well I HAVE heard of people getting married even younger n you were
he said You take India for instance Why they get married in India
when theyre twelve and even seven and eight years old

They do not said Jane promptly Their mothers and fathers wouldnt
let em an they wouldnt want to anyway

I suppose you been to India and know all about it William retorted
For the matter o that there was a young couple got married in
Pennsylvania the other day the girl was only fifteen and the man was
sixteen It was in the papers and their parents consented and said it
was a good thing Then there was a case in Fall River Massachusetts
where a young man eighteen years old married a woman fortyone years
old it was in the papers too And I heard of another case somewhere in
Iowaa boy began shaving when he was thirteen and shaved every day for
four years and now hes got a full beard and hes goin to get married
this yearbefore hes eighteen years old Joe Bullitts got a cousin in
Iowa that knows about this casehe knows the girl this fellow with the
beard is goin to marry and he says he expects it ll turn out the
best thing could have happened Theyre goin to live on a farm Theres
hunderds of cases like that only you dont hear of moren just a few
of em People used to get married at sixteen seventeen
eighteenanywhere in thereand never think anything of it at all
Right up to about a hunderd years ago there were more people married at
those ages than there were along about twentyfour and twentyfive the
way they are now For instance you take Shakespeare

William paused

Mr Genesis was scraping the hull of the miniature boat with a piece of
broken glass in lieu of sandpaper but he seemed to be following his
young friends remarks with attention William had mentioned Shakespeare
impulsively in the ardor of demonstrating his point however upon
second thought he decided to withdraw the name

I mean you take the olden times he went on hardly anybody got
married after they were nineteen or twenty years old unless they were
widowers because they were all married by that time And right here in
our own county there were eleven couples married in the last six months
under twentyone years of age Ive got a friend named Johnnie Watson
his uncle works down at the courthouse and told him about it so it
cant be denied Then there was a case I heard of over in

Mr Genesis uttered a loud chuckle My gooness he exclaimed How
you cleck all dem facs Lan name What puzzlin ME is how you
member em after you done cleck em Ef it uz me I couldnt cleck em
in de firs place an ef I could dey wouldn be no use to me cause I
couldnt rickalect em

Well it isnt so hard said William if you kind of get the hang
of it Obviously pleased he plucked a spear of grass and placed it
between his teeth adding I always did have a pretty good memory

Mamma says youre the most forgetful boy she ever heard of said Jane
calmly She says you cant remember anything two minutes

Williams brow darkened Now look here he began with severity

But the old darky intervened Some folks got good rickaleckshum
an some folks got bad he said pacifically Young white germmun
rickalect mo in two minute dan what I kin in two years

Jane appeared to accept this as settlement of the point at issue while
William bestowed upon Mr Genesis a glance of increased favor Williams
expression was pleasant to see in fact it was the pleasantest
expression Jane had seen him wearing for several days Almost always
lately he was profoundly preoccupied and so easily annoyed that
there was no need to be careful of his feelings becauseas his mother
observedhe was certain to break out about every so often no matter
what happened

I remember pretty much everything he said as if in modest
explanation of the performance which had excited the aged mans
admiration I can remember things that happened when I was four years
old

So can I said Jane I can remember when I was two I had a kitten
fell down the cistern and papa said it hurt the water

My gooness Mr Genesis exclaimed An you uz ony two year ole
honey Bes _I_ kin do is rickalect when I uz bout fifty

Oh no Jane protested You said you remembered havin a baby when you
were seventeen Mr Genesis

Yesm he admitted I mean rickalect good like you do bout yo lil
cat an all how yo pappy tuck on bout it I kin rickalect SOME but I
cain rickalect GOOD

William coughed with a certain importance Do you remember he asked
when you were married how did you feel about it Were you kind of
nervous or anything like that beforehand

Mr Genesis again passed a wavering hand across his troubled brow

I mean said William observing his perplexity were you sort of
shakyfrinstance as if you were taking an important step in life

Lemme see The old man pondered for a moment I felt mighty shaky
once I rickalect dat time yalla mlatta man shootin at me f um
behime a snakefence

Shootin at you Jane cried stirred from her accustomed placidity
Mr Genesis What DID he do that for

Nuffm replied Mr Genesis with feeling Nuffm in de wide worl
He boun to shoot SOMEbody an pick on me cause I uz de handies

He closed his knife gave the little boat a final scrape with the broken
glass and then a soothing rub with the palm of his hand Dah honey
he saidand simultaneously factory whistles began to blow Dah
yo lil steamboat good as I kin git her widout no biler ner no
smokestack I reckon yo pappy ll buy em fer you

Jane was grateful Its a beautiful boat Mr Genesis I do thank you

Genesis the son laid aside his tools and approached Pappy finish
whittlin spang on em noon whistles he chuckled Come long pappy
I bet you walk fas nuff goin todes dinnuh I hear frycakes ploppin
in skillet

Mr Genesis laughed loudly his sons words evidently painting a merry
and alluring picture and the two followed by Clematis moved away
in the direction of the alley gate William and Jane watched the brisk
departure of the antique with sincere esteem and liking

He must have been sixteen said William musingly

When Jane asked

William in deep thought was still looking after Mr Genesis he
was almost unconscious that he had spoken aloud and he replied
automatically

When he was married

Then with a start he realized into how great a condescension he had
been betrayed and hastily added with pronounced hauteur Things you
dont understand You run in the house

Jane went into the house but she did not carry her obedience to the
point of running She walked slowly and in that state of profound
reverie which was characteristic of her when she was immersed in the
serious study of Williams affairs




XVI

THE SHOWER

She continued to be thoughtful until after lunch when upon the
suns disappearance behind a fat cloud Jane and the heavens exchanged
dispositions for the timethe heavens darkened and Jane brightened She
was in the front hall when the sunshine departed rather abruptly and
she jumped for joy pointing to the open door Look Looky there she
called to her brother Richly ornamented he was descending the front
stairs his embellishments including freshly pressed white trousers a
new straw hat unusual shoes and a blasphemous tie Im goin to get
to sail my boat Jane shouted Its goin to rain

It is not said William irritated Its not going to anything like
rain I spose you think it ought to rain just to let you sail that
chunk of wood

Its goin to rainits goin to rain Jane made a little singsong
chant of it Its goin to rainit gives Willie a painits goin to
rainit gives Willie a painits goin to

He interrupted her sternly Look here Youre old enough to know
better I spose you think there isnt anything as important in the
world as your gettin the chance to sail that little boat I spose
you think business and everything else has got to stop and get ruined
maybe just to please you As he spoke he walked to an umbrellastand
in the hall and deliberately took therefrom a bamboo walkingstick of
his fathers Indeed his denunciation of Janes selfishness about
the weather was made partly to reassure himself and settle his nerves
strained by the unusual procedure he contemplated and partly to divert
Janes attention In the latter effort he was unsuccessful her eyes
became strange and unbearable

She uttered a shriek

Willies goin to carry a CANE

You hush up he said fiercely and hurried out through the front
door She followed him to the edge of the porch she stood there while
he made his way to the gate and she continued to stand there as he
went down the street trying to swing the cane in an accustomed and
unembarrassed manner

Jane made this difficult

Willies got a CANE she screamed Hes got papas CANE
Then resuming her little chant she began to sing Its goin to
rainWillies got papas caneits goin to rainWillies got papas
cane She put all of her voice into a final effort MISS PRATTLL GET
WET IF YOU DONT TAKE AN UMBERELLERRR

The attention of several chance pedestrians had been attracted and the
burning William breaking into an agonized halftrot disappeared round
the corner Then Jane retired within the house feeling that she had
done her duty It would be his own fault if he got wet

Rain was coming Rain was in the feel of the airand in Janes hope

She was not disappointed Mr Genesis so secure of fair weather in the
morning was proved by the afternoon to be a bad prophet The fat cloud
was succeeded by others fatter a corpulent army assailed the vault
of heaven heavy outriders before a giant of evil complexion and
devastating temper

An hour after William had left the house the dust in the streets and
all loose paper and rubbish outdoors rose suddenly to a considerable
height and started for somewhere else The trees had colic everything
became as dark as winter twilight streaks of wildfire ran miles in a
second and somebody seemed to be ripping up sheets of copper and tin
the size of farms The rain came with a swish then with a rattle and
then with a roar while people listened at their garret doorways and
marveled Windowpanes turned to running waterit poured

Then it relented dribbled shook down a few last drops and passed on
to the countryside Windows went up eaves and full gutters plashed and
gurgled clearer light fell then in a moment sunshine rushed upon
shining green trees and green grass doors openedand out came the
children

Shouting they ran to the flooded gutters Here were rivers lakes and
oceans for navigation easy pilotage for the steersman had but to wade
beside his craft and guide it with a twig Janes timely boat was one of
the first to reach the water

Her mother had been kind and Jane with shoes and stockings left behind
her on the porch was a happy sailor as she waded kneedeep along the
brimming curbstones At the corner below the house of the Baxters the
street was flooded clear across and Janes boat following the current
proceeded gallantly onward here sailed down the next block and was
thoughtlessly entering a sewer when she snatched it out of the water
Looking about her she perceived a gutter which seemed even lovelier
than the one she had followed It was deeper and broader and perhaps a
little browner wherefore she launched her ship upon its dimpled bosom
and explored it as far as the next sewerhole or portage Thus the
voyage continued for several blocks with only one accidentwhich might
have happened to anybody It was an accident in the nature of a fall
caused by the sliding of Janes left foot on some slippery mud
This treacherous substance covered with water could not have been
anticipated consequently Janes emotions were those of indignation
rather than of culpability Upon rising she debated whether or not
she should return to her dwelling inclining to the opinion that the
authorities there would have taken the affirmative but as she was
wet not much above the waist and the guilt lay all upon the mud
she decided that such an interruption of her journey would be a gross
injustice to herself Navigation was reopened

Presently the boat wandered into a miniature whirlpool grooved in a
spiral and pleasant to see Slowly the water went round and round and
so did the boat without any assistance from Jane Watching this movement
thoughtfully she brought forth from her drenched pocket some sodden
whitish disks recognizable as having been crackers and began to eat
them Thus absorbed she failed at first to notice the approach of two
young people along the sidewalk

They were the entranced William and Miss Pratt and their appearance
offered a suggestive contrast in relative humidity In charming and
tendercolored fabrics fluffy and cool and summery she was specklessly
dry not a drop had touched even the little pink parasol over her
shoulder not one had fallen upon the tiny white doglet drowsing upon
her arm But William was wethe was still more than merely damp though
they had evidently walked some distance since the rain had ceased to
fall His new hat was a mucilaginous ruin his dank coat sagged his
shapeless trousers flopped heavily and his shoes gave forth marshy
sounds as he walked

No brilliant analyst was needed to diagnose this case Surely any
observer must have said Here is a dry young lady and at her side
walks a wet young gentleman who carries an umbrella in one hand and a
walkingstick in the other Obviously the young lady and gentleman
were out for a stroll for which the stick was sufficient and they were
caught by the rain Before any fell however he found her a place of
sheltersuch as a corner drugstore and then himself gallantly went
forth into the storm for an umbrella He went to the young ladys house
or to the house where she may be visiting for if he had gone to his
own he would have left his stick It may be too that at his own his
mother would have detained him since he is still at the age when it
is just possible sometimes for mothers to get their sons into the house
when it rains He returned with the umbrella to the corner drugstore
at probably about the time when the rain ceased to fall because his
extreme moistness makes necessary the deduction that he was out in all
the rain that rained But he does not seem to care

The fact was that William did not even know that he was wet With his
head sidewise and his entranced eyes continuously upon the pretty face
so near his state was almost somnambulistic Not conscious of his
soggy garments or of the deluged streets he floated upon a rosy cloud
incense about him faraway music enchanting his ears

If Jane had not recognized the modeling of his features she might not
have known them to be Williams for they had altered their grouping
to produce an expression with which she was totally unfamiliar To be
explicit she was unfamiliar with this expression in that placethat is
to say upon William though she had seen something like it upon other
people once or twice in church

Williams thoughts might have seemed to her as queer as his expression
could she have known them They were not very definite however taking
the form of sweet vague pictures of the future These pictures were of
married life that is married life as William conceived it for himself
and Miss Prattsomething strikingly different from that he had observed
as led by his mother and father or their friends and relatives In his
rapt mind he beheld Miss Pratt walking beside him through life with
her little parasol and her little dogher exquisite face always lifted
playfully toward his own with admiration underneath the playfulness
and he heard her voice of silver always rippling babytalk throughout
all the years to come He saw her applauding his triumphsthough these
remained indefinite in his mind and he was unable to foreshadow the
business or profession which was to provide the amazing mansion mainly
conservatory which he pictured as their home Surrounded by flowers
and maintaining a private orchestra he saw Miss Pratt and himself
growing old together attaining to such ages as thirty and even
thirtyfive still in perfect harmony and always either dancing in
the evenings or strolling hand in hand in the moonlight Sometimes they
would visit the nursery where curlyheaded rosy cherubs played upon a
whitebear rug in the firelight These were all boys and readymade the
youngest being three years old and without a past

They would be beautiful children happy with their luxurious toys on the
bear rug and they would NEVER be seen in any part of the house except
the nursery Their deportment would be flawless and

WILLEE

The aviator struck a hole in the air his heart misgave him Then he
came to eartha sickening drop and instantaneous

WILLEE

There was Jane a figurine in a plastic state and altogether
disgracefulshe came up out of the waters and stood before them with
feet of clay indeed pedestaled upon the curbstone

Who IS that CURIOUS child said Miss Pratt stopping

William shuddered

Was she calling YOU Miss Pratt asked incredulously

Willie I told you you better take an umbereller said Jane instead
of papas cane And she added triumphantly Now you see

Moving forward she seemed to have in mind a dreadful purpose there
was something about her that made William think she intended casually to
accompany him and Miss Pratt

You go home he commanded hoarsely

Miss Pratt uttered a little scream of surprise and recognition Its
your little sister she exclaimed and then reverting to her favorite
playfulness of enunciation Oor ickle sissa she added gaily as
a translation Jane misunderstood it she thought Miss Pratt meant OUR
little sister

Go home said William

Noty noty said Miss Pratt shaking her head Me fraid oos a
noty noty ickle dirl All datie

Jane advanced I wish youd let me carry Flopit for you she said

Giving forth another gentle scream Miss Pratt hopped prettily backward
from Janes extended hands Oooo she cried chidingly Mustnt
touch Peshus Flopit all soapwaterwash clean Ickle dirly all
muddynassy Ickle dirly must doe home det all soapwaterwash clean
like NICE ickle sissa Evabody will love oor ickle sissa den she
concluded turning to William Tell oor ickle sissa MUS doe home det
soapwaterwash

Jane stared at Miss Pratt with fixed solemnity during the delivery of
these admonitions and it was to be seen that they made an impression
upon her Her mouth slowly opened but she spake not An extraordinary
idea had just begun to make itself at home in her mind It was an idea
which had been hovering in the neighborhood of that domain ever since
Williams comments upon the conversation of Mr Genesis in the morning

Go home repeated William and then as Jane stood motionless and
inarticulate transfixed by her idea he said almost brokenly to his
dainty companion I DONT know what youll think of my mother To let
this child

Miss Pratt laughed comfortingly as they started on again Isnt mammas
fault foolish boy Baxter Ickle dirlies will det datie

The profoundly mortified William glanced back over his shoulder
bestowing upon Jane a look in which bitterness was mingled with
apprehension But she remained where she was and did not follow
That was a little to be thankful for and he found some additional
consolation in believing that Miss Pratt had not caught the frightful
words papas cane at the beginning of the interview He was
encouraged to this belief by her presently taking from his hand the
decoration in question and examining it with tokens of pleasure Oor
pitty walktick she called it with a tact he failed to suspect And
so he began to float upward again glamors enveloped him and the earth
fell away

He was alone in space with Miss Pratt once more




XVII

JANES THEORY

The pale end of sunset was framed in the diningroom windows and Mr
and Mrs Baxter and the rehabilitated Jane were at the table when
William made his belated return from the afternoons excursion Seating
himself he waived his mothers references to the rain his clothes and
probable colds and after one laden glance at Jane denoting a grievance
so elaborate that he despaired of setting it forth in a formal complaint
to the Powershe fell into a state of trance He took nourishment
automatically and roused himself but once during the meal a pathetic
encounter with his father resulting from this awakening

Everybody in town seemed to be on the streets this evening as I
walked home Mr Baxter remarked addressing his wife I suppose
theres something in the clean air after a rain that brings em out I
noticed one thing though maybe its the way they dress nowadays but
you certainly dont see as many pretty girls on the streets as there
used to be

William looked up absently I used to think that too he said with
dreamy condescension when I was younger

Mr Baxter stared

Well Ill be darned he said

Papa papa his wife called reprovingly

When you were younger Mr Baxter repeated with considerable
irritation How old d you think you are

Im going on eighteen said William firmly I know plenty of
casescases where He paused relapsing into lethargy

Whats the matter with him Mr Baxter inquired heatedly of his
wife

William again came to life I was saying that a persons age is
different according to circumstances he explained with dignity if
not lucidity You take Genesiss father Well he was married when he
was sixteen Then there was a case over in Iowa that lots of people
know about and nobody thinks anything of A young man over there in Iowa
thats seventeen years old began shaving when he was thirteen and shaved
every day for four years and now

He was interrupted by his father who was no longer able to contain
himself And now I suppose hes got WHISKERS he burst forth Theres
an ambition for you My soul

It was Jane who took up the tale She had been listening with growing
excitement her eyes fixed piercingly upon William Hes got a beard
she cried alluding not to her brother but to the fabled Iowan I
heard Willie tell ole Mr Genesis about it

It seems to lie heavily on your mind Mr Baxter said to William I
suppose you feel that in the face of such an example your life between
the ages of thirteen and seventeen has been virtually thrown away

William had again relapsed but he roused himself feebly Sir he
said

What IS the matter with him Mr Baxter demanded Half the time
lately he seems to be hibernating and only responds by a slight
twitching when poked with a stick The other half of the time he either
behaves like Idontknowwhat or talks about children growing whiskers
in Iowa Hasnt that girl left town yet

William was not so deep in trance that this failed to stir him He left
the table

Mrs Baxter looked distressed though as the meal was about concluded
and William had partaken of his share in spite of his dreaminess she
had no anxieties connected with his sustenance As for Mr Baxter he
felt a little remorse undoubtedly but he was also puzzled So plain
a man was he that he had no perception of the callous brutality of
the words THAT GIRL when applied to some girls He referred to his
mystification a little later as he sat with his evening paper in the
library

I dont know what I said to that tetchy boy to hurt him he began in
an apologetic tone I dont see that there was anything too rough for
him to stand in a little sarcasm He neednt be so sensitive on the
subject of whiskers it seems to me

Mrs Baxter smiled faintly and shook her head

It was Jane who responded She was seated upon the floor disporting
herself mildly with her paintbox Papa I know whats the matter with
Willie she said

Do you Mr Baxter returned Well if you make it pretty short
youve got just about long enough to tell us before your bedtime

I think hes married said Jane

What And her parents united their hilarity

I do think hes married Jane insisted unmoved I think hes married
with that Miss Pratt

Well said her father he does seem upset and it may be that her
visit and the idea of whiskers coming so close together is more than
mere coincidence but I hardly think Willie is married Jane

Well then she returned thoughtfully hes almost married I know
that much anyway

What makes you think so

Well because I KIND of thought he must be married or anyways
somepm when he talked to Mr Genesis this mornin He said he knew how
some people got married in Pennsylvania an India an he said they were
only seven or eight years old He said so an I heard him an he said
there were eleven people married that were only seventeen an this boy
in Iowa got a full beard an got married too An he said Mr Genesis
was only sixteen when HE was married He talked all about gettin
married when youre seventeen years old an he said how people thought
it was the best thing could happen So I just KNOW hes almost married

Mr Baxter chuckled and Mrs Baxter smiled but a shade of
thoughtfulness a remote anxiety tell upon the face of the latter

You havent any other reason have you Jane she asked

Yesm said Jane promptly An its a more reason than any Miss
Pratt calls you mamma as if you were HER mamma She does it when she
talks to Willie

Jane

Yes m I HEARD her An Willie said I dont know what youll think
about mother He said I dont know what youll think about mother
to Miss Pratt

Mrs Baxter looked a little startled and her husband frowned Jane
mistook their expressions for incredulity They DID mamma she
protested Thats just the way they talked to each other I heard em
this afternoon when Willie had papas cane

Maybe they were doing it to tease you if you were with them Mr
Baxter suggested

I wasnt with em I was sailin my boat an they came along an
first they never saw me an Willie lookedoh papa I wish youd seen
him Jane rose to her feet in her excitement His face was so funny
you never saw anything like it He was walkin along with it turned
sideways an all the time he kept walkin frontways he kept his face
sidewayslike this papa Look papa And she gave what she considered
a faithful imitation of William walking with Miss Pratt Look papa
This is the way Willie went He had it sideways sos he could see Miss
Pratt papa An his face was just like this Look papa She contorted
her features in a terrifying manner Look papa

Dont Jane her mother exclaimed

Well I haf to show papa how Willie looked dont I said Jane
relaxing Thats just the way he looked Well an then they stopped
an talked to me an Miss Pratt said Its our little sister

Did she really Mrs Baxter asked gravely

Yesm she did Soon as she saw who I was she said Why its our
little sister Only she said it that way she talkssort of foolish
Its our ittle sissysomepm like that mamma She said it twice an
told me to go home an get washed up An Miss Pratt told WillieMiss
Pratt said It isnt mammas fault Janes so dirty just like that
She

Are you sure she said our little sister said Mrs Baxter

Why you can ask Willie She said it that funny way Our ittle
sissy thats what she said An Miss Pratt said Evrybody would love
our little sister if mamma washed her in soap an water You can ask
Willie thats exackly what Miss Pratt said an if you dont believe it
you can ask HER If you dont want to believe it why you can ask

Hush dear said Mrs Baxter All this doesnt mean anything at all
especially such nonsense as Willies thinking of being married Its
your bedtime

Well but MAMMA

Was that all they said Mr Baxter inquired

Jane turned to him eagerly They said all lots of things like that
papa They

Nonsense Mrs Baxter in interrupted Come its bedtime Ill go up
with you You mustnt think such nonsense

But mamma

Come along Jane

Jane was obedient in the flesh but her spirit was free her opinions
were her own Disappointed in the sensation she had expected to produce
she followed her mother out of the room wearing the expression of a
person who says Youll SEEsome day when everythings ruined

Mr Baxter left alone laughed quietly lifted his neglected newspaper
to obtain the light at the right angle and then allowed it to languish
upon his lap again Frowning he began to tap the floor with his shoe

He was trying to remember what things were in his head when he was
seventeen and it was difficult It seemed to him that he had been a
steady sensible young fellowreally quite a manat that age Looking
backward at the blur of youthful years the period from sixteen to
twentyfive appeared to him as pretty much all of a piece He could
not recall just when he stopped being a boy it must have been at about
fifteen he thought

All at once he sat up stiffly in his chair and the paper slid from his
knee He remembered an autumn long ago when he had decided to abandon
the educational plans of his parents and become an actor He had located
this project exactly for it dated from the night of his seventeenth
birthday when he saw John McCullough play Virginius

Even now Mr Baxter grew a little red as he remembered the remarkable
letter he had written a few weeks later to the manager of a passing
theatrical company He had confidently expected an answer and had made
his plans to leave town quietly with the company and afterward reassure
his parents by telegraph In fact he might have been on the stage at
this moment if that manager had taken him Mr Baxter began to look
nervous

Still there is a difference between going on the stage and getting
married I dont know though Mr Baxter thought And Willies
certainly not so well balanced in a GENERAL way as I was He wished
his wife would come down and reassure him though of course it was all
nonsense

But when Mrs Baxter came downstairs she did not reassure him Of
course Janes too absurd she said I dont mean that she made it
up she never does that and no doubt this little Miss Pratt did say
about what Jane thought she said But it all amounts to nothing

Of course

Willies just going through what several of the other boys about his
age are going throughlike Johnnie Watson and Joe Bullitt and Wallace
Banks They all seem to be frantic over her

I caught a glimpse of her the day you had her to tea Shes rather
pretty

Adorably And perhaps Willie has been just a LITTLE bit more frantic
than the others

He certainly seems in a queer state

At this his wifes tone became serious Do you think he WOULD do as
crazy a thing as that

Mr Baxter laughed Well I dont know what hed do it ON I dont
suppose he has more than a dollar in his possession

Yes he has she returned quickly Day before yesterday there was
a secondhand furniture man here and I was too busy to see him but
I wanted the storeroom in the cellar cleared out and I told Willie he
could have whatever the man would pay him for the junk in there if hed
watch to see that they didnt TAKE anything They found some old pieces
that Id forgotten underneath things and altogether the man paid
Willie nine dollars and eightyfive cents

But mercyme exclaimed Mr Baxter the girl may be an idiot but
she wouldnt run away and marry a boy just barely seventeen on nine
dollars and eightyfive cents

Oh no said Mrs Baxter At least I dont THINK so Of course girls
do as crazy things as boys sometimesin their way I was thinking
She paused Of COURSE there couldnt be anything in it but it did seem
a little strange

What did

Why just before I came downstairs Adelia came for the laundry and
I asked her if shed seen Willie and she said hed put on his dark
suit after dinner and he went out through the kitchen carrying his
suitcase

He did

Of course Mrs Baxter went on slowly I COULDNT believe hed do
such a thing but he really is in a PREPOSTEROUS way over this little
Miss Pratt and he DID have that money

By George Mr Baxter got upon his feet The way he talked at dinner
I could come pretty near believing he hasnt any more brains LEFT than
to get married on nine dollars and eightyfive cents I wouldnt put it
past him By George I wouldnt

Oh I dont think he would she remonstrated feebly Besides the
law wouldnt permit it

Mr Baxter paced the floor Oh I suppose they COULD manage it They
could go to some little town and give false ages and He broke off
Adelia was sure he had his suitcase

She nodded Do you think wed better go down to the Parchers Wed
just say we came to call of course and if

Get your hat on he said I dont think theres anything in it at
all but wed just as well drop down there It cant HURT anything

Of course I dont think she began

Neither do I he interrupted irascibly But with a boy of his age
crazy enough to think hes in love how do WE know what ll happen
Were only his parents Get your hat on

But when the uneasy couple found themselves upon the pavement before
the house of the Parchers they paused under the shadetrees in the
darkness and presently decided that it was not necessary to go in
Suddenly their uneasiness had fallen from them From the porch came
the laughter of several young voices and then one silvery voice which
pretended to be that of a tiny child

Oh same Same on oo big Bruvva JosieJoe Mus be polite to Johnny
Jumpup or tant play wiv May and Lola

Thats Miss Pratt whispered Mrs Baxter Shes talking to Johnnie
Watson and Joe Bullitt and May Parcher Lets go home its all right
Of course I knew it would be

Why certainly said Mr Baxter as they turned Even if Willie were
as crazy as that the little girl would have more sense I wouldnt have
thought anything of it if you hadnt told me about the suitcase That
looked sort of queer

She agreed that it did but immediately added that she had thought
nothing of it What had seemed more significant to her was Williams
interest in the early marriage of Genesiss father and in the Iowa
beard story she said Then she said that it WAS curious about the
suitcase

And when they came to their own house again there was William sitting
alone and silent upon the steps of the porch

I thought youd gone out Willie said his mother as they paused
beside him

Maam

Adelia said you went out carrying your suitcase

Oh yes he said languidly If you leave clothes at Schwartzs in the
evening they have em pressed in the morning You said I looked damp at
dinner so I took em over and left em there

I see Mrs Baxter followed her husband to the door but she stopped
on the threshold and called back

Dont sit there too long Willie

Maam

The dew is falling and it rained so hard todayIm afraid it might be
damp

Maam

Come on Mr Baxter said to his wife Hes down on the Parchers
porch not out in front here Of course he cant hear you Its three
blocks and a half

But Williams father was mistaken Little he knew William was not upon
the porch of the Parchers with May Parcher and Joe Bullitt and Johnnie
Watson to interfere He was far from there in a land where time was
not Upon a planet floating in pink mist and uninhabitedunless old
Mr Genesis and some Hindoo princes and the diligent Iowan may have
established themselves in its remoter regionsWilliam was alone with
Miss Pratt in the conservatory And after a time they went together
and looked into the door of a room where an indefinite number of little
boysall over three years of agewere playing in the firelight upon a
whitebear rug For in the roseate gossamer that boys dreams are made
of William had indeed entered the married state

His condition was growing worse every day

THE BIG FAT LUMMOX

In the morning sunshine Mrs Baxter stood at the top of the steps of
the front porch addressing her son who listened impatiently and edged
himself a little nearer the gate every time he shifted his weight from
one foot to the other

Willie she said you must really pay some attention to the laws of
health or youll never live to be an old man

I dont want to live to be an old man said William earnestly Id
rather do what I please now and die a little sooner

You talk very foolishly his mother returned Either come back and
put on some heavier THINGS or take your overcoat

My overcoat William groaned Theyd think I was a lunatic carrying
an overcoat in August

Not to a picnic she said

Mother it isnt a picnic Ive told you a hunderd times You think
its one those olefashion things YOU used to go tosit on the damp
ground and eat sardines with ants all over em This isnt anything like
that we just go out on the trolley to this farmhouse and have noon
dinner and dance all afternoon and have supper and then come home on
the trolley I guess wed hardly of got up anything as out o date as a
picnic in honor of Miss PRATT

Mrs Baxter seemed unimpressed

It doesnt matter whether you call it a picnic or not Willie It will
be cool on the open trolleycar coming home especially with only those
white trousers on

Ye gods he cried Ive got other things on besides my trousers I
wish you wouldnt always act as if I was a perfect child Good heavens
isnt a person my age supposed to know how much clothes to wear

Well if he is she returned its a mere supposition and not founded
on fact Dont get so excited Willie please but youll either have to
give up the picnic or come in and ch

Change my things he wailed I cant change my things Ive got
just twenty minutes to get to May Parchersthe crowd meets there and
theyre goin to take the trolley in front the Parchers at exactly a
quarter after leven PLEASE dont keep me any longer motherI GOT to
go

She stepped into the hall and returned immediately Heres your
overcoat Willie

His expression was of despair Theyll think Im a lunatic and theyll
say so before everybodyand I dont blame em Overcoat on a hot day
like this Except me I dont suppose there was ever anybody lived in
the world and got to be going on eighteen years old and had to carry his
silly old overcoat around with him in Augustbecause his mother made
him

Willie said Mrs Baxter you dont know how many thousands and
thousands of mothers for thousands and thousands of years have kept
their sons from taking thousands and thousands of coldsjust this way

He moaned Well and I got to be called a lunatic just because youre
nervous I spose All right

She hung it upon his arm kissed him and he departed in a desperate
manner

However having worn his tragic face for three blocks he halted before
a corner drugstore and permitted his expression to improve as he
gazed upon the window display of My Little Sweetheart AllTobacco Cuban
Cigarettes the Package of Twenty for Ten Cents William was not a
smokerthat is to say he had made the usual boyhood experiments
finding them discouraging and though at times he considered it
humorously manabouttown to say to a smoking friend Well _I_ll
tackle one o your ole coffinnails he had never made a purchase
of tobacco in his life But it struck him now that it would be rather
debonair to disport himself with a package of Little Sweethearts upon
the excursion

And the name It thrilled him inexpressibly bringing a tenderness into
his eyes and a glow into his bosom He felt that when he should smoke
a Little Sweetheart it would be a tribute to the ineffable visitor for
whom this party was being givenit would bring her closer to him His
young brow grew almost stern with determination for he made up his
mind on the spot that he would smoke oftener in the futurehe would
become a confirmed smoker and all his life he would smoke My Little
Sweetheart AllTobacco Cuban Cigarettes

He entered and managed to make his purchase in a matteroffact way as
if he were doing something quite unemotional then he said to the clerk

Oh by the byah

The clerk stared Well what else

I mean said William hurriedly theres something I wanted to tend
to now I happen to be here I was on my way to take this overcoat
toto get something altered at the tailors for next winter Course
I wouldnt want it till winter but I thought I might as well get it
DONE He paused laughing carelessly for greater plausibility I
thought hed probly want lots of time on the jobhes a slow worker
Ive noticedand so I decided I might just as well go ahead and let him
get at it Well so I was on my way there but I just noticed I only
got about six minutes more to get to a mighty important engagement I got
this morning and Id like to leave it here and come by and get it on my
way home this evening

Sure said the clerk Hang it on that hook inside the
pscriptioncounter Theres one there already blongs to your friend
that young Bullitt fella He was in here awhile ago and said he wanted
to leave his because he didnt have time to take it to be pressed in
time for next winter Then he went on and joined that crowd in Mr
Parchers yard around the corner thats goin on a trolleyparty I
says I betcher mother maje carry it and he says Oh no Oh no he
says Honest I was goin to get it pressed You can hang yours on the
same nail

The clerk spoke no more and went to serve another customer while
William stared after him a little uneasily It seemed that here was a
man of suspicious nature though of course Joe Bullitts shallow talk
about getting an overcoat pressed before winter would not have imposed
upon anybody However William felt strongly that the private life of
the customers of a store should not be pried into and speculated about
by employees and he was conscious of a distaste for this clerk

Nevertheless it was with a lighter heart that he left his overcoat
behind him and stepped out of the side door of the drugstore That
brought him within sight of the gaily dressed young people about thirty
in number gathered upon the small lawn beside Mr Parchers house

Miss Pratt stood among them in heliotrope and white Flopit nestling in
her arms She was encircled by girls who were enthusiastically caressing
the bored and blinking Flopit and when William beheld this charming
group his breath became eccentric his kneecaps became cold and
convulsive his neck became hot and he broke into a light perspiration

She saw him The small blonde head and the delirious little fluffy hat
above it shimmered a nod to him Then his mouth fell unconsciously open
and his eyes grew glassy with the intensity of meaning he put into
the silent response he sent across the picket fence and through the
interstices of the intervening group Pressing with his elbow upon the
package of cigarettes in his pocket he murmured inaudibly My Little
Sweetheart always for youa repetition of his vow that come what
might he would forever remain a loyal smoker of that symbolic brand In
fact Williams mental condition had never shown one moments turn for
the better since the fateful day of the distracting visitors arrival

Mr Johnnie Watson and Mr Joe Bullitt met him at the gate and offered
him hearty greeting All bickering and dissension among these three had
passed The lady was so wondrous impartial that as time went on the
sufferers had come to be drawn together rather than thrust asunder by
their common feeling It had grown to be a bond uniting them they
were not so much rivals as ardent novices serving a single altar each
worshiping there without visible gain over the other Each had even come
to possess in the eyes of his two fellows almost a sacredness as a
sharer in the celestial glamor they were tender one with another They
were in the last stages

Johnnie Watson had with him today a visitor of his owna vastly
overgrown person of eighteen who at Johnnies beckoning abandoned
a fair companion of the moment and came forward as William entered the
gate

I want to intradooce you to two of my most intmut friends George
said Johnnie with the anxious gravity of a person about to do something
important and unfamiliar Mr Baxter let me intradooce my cousin
Mr Crooper Mr Crooper this is my friend Mr Baxter

The gentlemen shook hands solemnly saying

M very glad to meet you and Johnnie turned to Joe Bullitt Mr
CrooI mean Mr Bullitt let me intradooce my friend Mr CrooperI
mean my cousin Mr Crooper Mr Crooper is a cousin of mine

Glad to make your acquaintance Mr Crooper said Joe I suppose
youre a cousin of Johnnies then

Yep said Mr Crooper becoming more informal Johnnie wrote me
to come over for this shindig so I thought I might as well come
He laughed loudly and the others laughed with the same heartiness
Yessir he added I thought I might as well come cause Im pretty
apt to be on hand if theres anything doin

Well thats right said William and while they all laughed again
Mr Crooper struck his cousin a jovial blow upon the back

Hi ole sport he cried I want to meet that Miss Pratt before we
start The carll be along pretty soon and I got her picked for the
girl Im goin to sit by

The laughter of William and Joe Bullitt designed to express cordiality
suddenly became flaccid and died If Mr Crooper had been a sensitive
person he might have perceived the chilling disapproval in their
glances for they had just begun to be most unfavorably impressed with
him The careless loudnessalmost the notorietywith which he had
uttered Miss Pratts name demanding loosely to be presented to her
regardless of the wellknown law that a lady must first express some
wish in such mattersthese were indications of a coarse nature sure
to be more than uncongenial to Miss Pratt Its presence might make the
whole occasion distasteful to hermight spoil her day Both William and
Joe Bullitt began to wonder why on earth Johnnie Watson didnt have
any more sense than to invite such a big fat lummox of a cousin to the
party

This severe phrase of theirs almost simultaneous in the two minds was
not wholly a failure as a thumbnail sketch of Mr George Crooper And
yet there was the impressiveness of size about him especially about
his legs and chin At seventeen and eighteen growth is still going on
sometimes in a sporadic way several parts seeming to have sprouted
faster than others Often the features have not quite settled down
together in harmony a mouth for instance appearing to have gained
such a lead over the rest of a face that even a mother may fear it
can never be overtaken Voices too often seem misplaced one hears
outside the door the bass rumble of a sinister giant and a mild boy
thin as a cricket walks in The contrary was George Croopers case
his voice was an unexpected piping tenor half falsetto and frequently
girlishas surprising as the absurd voice of an elephant

He had the general outwardness of a vast and lumpy child His chin had
so distanced his other features that his eyes nose and brow seemed
almost babylike in comparison while his mountainous legs were the
great part of the rest of him He was one of those huge bottleshaped
boys who are always in motion in spite of their cumbersomeness His
gestures were continuous though difficult to interpret as bearing
upon the subject of his equally continuous conversation and under all
circumstances he kept his conspicuous legs incessantly moving whether
he was going anywhere or remaining in comparatively one spot

His expression was pathetically offensive the result of his bland
confidence in the audible opinions of a small town whereof his father
was the richest inhabitantand the one thing about him even more
obvious than his chin his legs and his spectacular taste in flannels
was his perfect trust that he was as welcome to every one as he was to
his mother This might some day lead him in the direction of great pain
but on the occasion of the subscription party for Miss Pratt it gave
him an advantage

When do I get to meet that cutie he insisted as Johnnie Watson moved
backward from the cousinly arm which threatened further flailing You
intradooced me to about seven I cant do much FOR but I want to get the
howdy business over with this Miss Pratt so I and she can get things
started Im goin to keep her busy all day

Well dont be in such a hurry said Johnnie uneasily You can meet
her when we get out in the countryif I get a chance George

No sir George protested jovially I guess youre sad birds over in
this town but look out When I hit a town it dont take long till they
all hear theres something doin You know how I am when I get
started Johnnie Here he turned upon William tucking his fat arm
affectionately through Williams thin one Hi sport Ole Johnnies so
slow YOU toddle me over and get me fixed up with this Miss Pratt and
Ill tell her youre the real stuffafter we get engaged

He was evidently a true cloudcompeller this horrible George




XIX

I DUNNO WHY IT IS

William extricated his arm huskily muttering words which were lost in
the general outcry Cars coming The young people poured out through
the gate and as the car stopped scrambled aboard For a moment
everything was hurried and confused William struggled anxiously to push
through to Miss Pratt and climb up beside her but Mr George Crooper
made his way into the crowd in a beaming though bulllike manner and a
fat back in a purpleandwhite blazer flattened Williams nose while
ponderous heels damaged Williams toes he was shoved back and just
managed to clamber upon the footboard as the car started The friendly
hand of Joe Bullitt pulled him to a seat and William found himself
rubbing his nose and sitting between Joe and Johnnie Watson directly
behind the dashing Crooper and Miss Pratt Mr Crooper had already taken
Flopit upon his lap

Dogs are always crazy bout me they heard him say for his high voice
was but too audible over all other sounds Dogs and chuldren I dunno
why it is but they always take to me My names George Crooper Third
Johnnie Watsons cousin He was tryin to intradooce me before the car
came along but he never got the chance I guess as this shindigs
for you and Im the only other guest from out o town well have to
intradooce ourselvesthe two guests of honor as it were

Miss Pratt laughed her silvery laugh murmured politely and turned no
freezing glance upon her neighbor Indeed it seemed that she was far
from regarding him with the distaste anticipated by William and Joe
Bullitt Flopit look so toot an tunnin she was heard to remark
Flopit look so ittle on dray big normous mans lap

Mr Crooper laughed deprecatingly He does look kind of small compared
with the good ole man thats got charge of him now Well I always was
a good deal bigger than the fellas I went with I dunno why it is but
I was always kind of quicker too as it wereand the strongest in any
crowd I ever got with Im kind of musclebound I guess but I dont let
that interfere with my quickness any Take me in an automobile nowI
got a racincar at homeand I keep my head better than most people do
as it were I can kind of handle myself better I dunno why it is My
brains seem to work better than other peoples thats all it is I
dont mean that I got more sense or anything like that its just the
way my brains work they kind of put me at an advantage as it were
Well frinstance if Id been livin here in this town and joined in
with the crowd to get up this party well it would of been done a good
deal diffrent I wont say better but diffrent Thats always the
way with me if I go into anything pretty soon Im running the whole
shebang I dunno why it is The other people might try to run it their
way for a while but pretty soon you notice em beginning to step out
of the way for good ole George I dunno why it is but thats the way it
goes Well if Id been running THIS party Id of had automobiles to go
out in not a trolleycar where you all got to sit togetherand Id
of sent over home for my little racer and Id of taken you out in her
myself I wish Id of sent for it anyway We could of let the rest go
out in the trolley and you and I could of got off by ourselves Id
like you to see that little car Well anyway I bet youd of seen
something pretty different and a whole lot better if Id of come over to
this town in time to get up this party for you

For US Miss Pratt corrected him sunnily

Bofe strangersparty for us twoall bofe And she gave him one of
her looks

Mr Crooper flushed with emotion he was annexed he became serious
Say he said thats a mighty smooth hat you got on And he touched
the fluffy rim of it with his forefinger His fat shoulders leaned
toward her yearningly

Wed certnly of had a lot better time sizzin along in that little
racer I got he said Id like to had you see how I handle that little
car Girls over home they say they like to go out with me just to watch
the way I handle her they say it aint so much just the ride but more
the way I handle that little car I dunno why it is but thats what
they say Thats the way I do anything I make up my mind to tackle
though I dont try to tackle everythingtheres lots o things I
wouldnt take enough interest in em as it werebut just lemme make up
my mind once and its all off I dunno why it is There was a brakeman
on the train got kind of fresh he didnt know who I was Well I
just put my hand on his shoulder and pushed him down in his seat like
thishe set his hand upon Miss Pratts shoulder I didnt want to hit
him because there was women and chuldren in the car so I just shoved
my face up close to him like this I guess you dont know how much
stock my fathers got in this road I says Did he wilt Well you
ought of seen that brakeman when I got through tellin him who I was

Nassy ole brateman said Miss Pratt with unfailing sympathy

Mr Croopers fat hand as if unconsciously gave Miss Pratts delicate
shoulder a little pat in reluctant withdrawal Well thats the way
with me he said Much as I been around this world nobody ever tried
to put anything over on me and got away with it They always come out
the little end o the horn I dunno why it is Say thats a mighty
smooth locket you got on the end o that chain there And again
stretching forth his hand in a proprietorlike way he began to examine
the locket

Three hot hearts just behind pulsated hatred toward him for Johnnie
Watson had perceived his error and his sentiments were now linked
to those of Joe Bullitt and William The unhappiness of these three
helpless spectators was the more poignant because not only were they
witnesses of the impression of greatness which George Crooper was
obviously producing upon Miss Pratt but they were unable to prevent
themselves from being likewise impressed

They were not analytical they dumbly accepted George at his own rating
not even being able to charge him with lack of modesty Did he not
always accompany his testimonials to himself with his deprecating
falsetto laugh and I dunno why it is an official disclaimer of merit
as it were Here was a formidable candidate indeeda traveler a man
of the world with brains better and quicker than other peoples brains
an athlete yet knightlyhe would not destroy even a brakeman in the
presence of women and childrenand finally most enviable and deadly
the owner and operator of a little racer All this glitter was not far
short of overpowering and yet though accepting it as fact the woeful
three shared the inconsistent belief that in spite of everything George
was nothing but a big fat lummox For thus they even rather loudly
whispered of himalmost as if hopeful that Miss Pratt and mayhap
George himself might overhear

Impotent their seething The overwhelming Crooper pursued his conquering
way He leaned more and more toward the magnetic girl his growing
tenderness having that effect upon him and his head inclining so
far that his bedewed brow now and then touched the fluffy hat He was
constitutionally restless but his movements never ended by placing a
greater distance between himself and Miss Pratt though they sometimes
discommoded Miss Parcher who sat at the other side of hima side of
him which appeared to be without consciousness He played naively with
Miss Pratts locket and with the filmy border of her collar he flicked
his nose for some time with her little handkerchief loudly sniffing its
scent and finally he became interested in a ring she wore removed it
and tried unsuccessfully to place it upon one of his own fingers

Ive worn lots o girls rings on my watchfob Id let em wear mine
on a chain or something I guess they like to do that with me he said
I dunno why it is

At this subtle hint the three unfortunates held their breath and then
lost it as the lovely girl acquiesced in the horrible exchange As for
William life was of no more use to him Out of the blue heaven of that
bright mornings promise had fallen a pall draping his soul in black
and purple He had been horrorstricken when first the pudgy finger of
George Crooper had touched the fluffy edge of that sacred little hat
then during Georges subsequent pawings and leanings William felt that
he must either rise and murder or go mad But when the exchange of rings
was accomplished his spirit broke and even resentment oozed away For a
time there was no room in him for anything except misery

Dully Williams eyes watched the fat shoulders hitching and twitching
while the heavy arms flourished in gesture and in further pawings
Again and again were Williams ears afflicted with I dunno why it is
following upon tribute after tribute paid by Mr Crooper to himself and
received with little cries of admiration and sweet childwords on the
part of Miss Pratt It was a long and accursed ride

SYDNEY CARTON

At the farmhouse where the party were to dine Miss Pratt with joy
discovered a harmonium in the parlor and seating herself with all the
girls Flopit and Mr George Crooper gathered around her she played
an accompaniment while George in a thin tenor of detestable sweetness
sang Im Falling in Love with Some One

His performance was rapturously greeted especially by the accompanist
Oh wunnerfulest Untle Georgiecums she cried for that was now the
gentlemans name If Johnnie McCormack hear Untle Georgiecums he
go shoot umself deadBang She looked round to where three figures
hovered morosely in the rear Tum on sin chorus Big Bruvva
JosieJoe Johnny Jumpup an Ickle Boy Baxter All over adain Untle
Georgiecums Boys an dirls all sin chorus Tummence

And so the heartrending performance continued until it was stopped by
Wallace Banks the altruistic and perspiring youth who had charge of
the subscriptionlist for the party and the consequent collection of
assessments This entitled Wallace to look haggard and to act as master
of ceremonies He mounted a chair

Ladies and gentlemen he bellowed I want to saythat isahI am
requested to announce t that before dinner were all supposed to take a
walk around the farm and look at things as this is supposed to be kind
of a model farm or supposed to be something like that Theres a Swedish
lady named Anna going to show us around Shes out in the yard waiting
so please follow her to inspect the farm

To inspect a farm was probably the least of Williams desires He wished
only to die in some quiet spot and to have Miss Pratt told about it in
words that would show her what she had thrown away But he followed
with the others in the wake of the Swedish lady named Anna and as they
stood in the cavernous hollow of the great barn he found his condition
suddenly improved

Miss Pratt turned to him unexpectedly and placed Flopit in his arms
Keep peshus Flopit cozy she whispered Flopit love ole friends
best

Williams heart leaped while a joyous warmth spread all over him And
though the execrable lummox immediately propelled Miss Pratt forwardby
her elbowto hear the descriptive remarks of the Swedish lady named
Anna Williams soul remained uplifted and entranced She had not said
like she had said Flopit LOVE ole friends best William pressed
forward valiantly and placed himself as close as possible upon the
right of Miss Pratt the lummox being upon her left A moment later
William wished that he had remained in the rear

This was due to the unnecessary frankness of the Swedish lady
named Anna who was briefly pointing out the efficiency of various
agricultural devices Her attention being diverted by some effusions of
pride on the part of a passing hen she thought fit to laugh and say

She yust laid egg

William shuddered This grossness in the presence of Miss Pratt was
unthinkable His mind refused to deal with so impossible a situation he
could not accept it as a fact that such words had actually been uttered
in such a presence And yet it was the truth his incredulous ears
still sizzled She yust laid egg His entire skin became flushed his
averted eyes glazed themselves with shame

He was not the only person shocked by the ribaldry of the Swedish lady
named Anna Joe Bullitt and Johnnie Watson on the outskirts of the
group went to Wallace Banks drew him aside and with feverish
eloquence set his responsibilities before him It was his duty they
urged to have an immediate interview with this freespoken Anna and
instruct her in the proprieties Wallace had been almost as horrified as
they by her loose remark but he declined the office they proposed for
him offering however to appoint them as a committee with authority
in the matterwhereupon they retorted with unreasonable indignation
demanding to know what he took them for

Unconscious of the embarrassment she had caused in these several
masculine minds the Swedish lady named Anna led the party onward
continuing her agricultural lecture William walked mechanically his
eyes averted and looking at no one And throughout this agony he was
burningly conscious of the blasphemed presence of Miss Pratt beside him

Therefore it was with no little surprise when the party came out of
the barn that William beheld Miss Pratt not walking at his side but
on the contrary sitting too cozily with George Crooper upon a fallen
tree at the edge of a peachorchard just beyond the barnyard It was
Miss Parcher who had been walking beside him for the truant couple had
made their escape at the beginning of the Swedish ladys discourse

In vain William murmured to himself Flopit love ole friends best
Purple and black again descended upon his soul for he could not
disguise from himself the damnatory fact that George had flitted with
the lady while he wretched William had been permitted to take care of
the dog

A spark of dignity still burned within him He strode to the barnyard
fence and leaning over it dropped Flopit rather brusquely at his
mistresss feet Then without a word even without a lookWilliam
walked haughtily away continuing his stern progress straight through
the barnyard gate and thence onward until he found himself in solitude
upon the far side of a smokehouse where his hauteur vanished

Here in the shade of a great walnuttree which sheltered the little
building he gave waynot to tears certainly but to faint murmurings
and little heavings under impulses as ancient as young love itself It
is to be supposed that William considered his condition a lonely one
but if all the seventeenyearolds who have known such halfhours could
have shown themselves to him then he would have fled from the mere
horror of billions Alas he considered his sufferings a new invention
in the world and there was now inspired in his breast a monologue so
eloquently bitter that it might deserve some such title as A Passion
Beside the Smokehouse During the little time that William spent in
this sequestration he passed through phases of emotion which would have
kept an older man busy for weeks and left him wrecked at the end of
them

Williams final mood was one of beautiful resignation with a kick in
it that is he nobly gave her up to George and added irresistibly that
George was a big fat lummox Painting pictures such as the billions
of other young sufferers before him have painted William saw himself
a sad gentle old bachelor at the family fireside sometimes making the
sacrifice of his reputation so that SHE and the children might never
know the truth about George and he gave himself the solace of a fierce
scene or two with George Remember it is for them not youyou
THING

After this human little reaction he passed to a higher field of romance
He would die for George and then she would bring the little boy she had
named William to the lonely headstoneSuddenly William saw himself in
his true and fitting characterSydney Carton He had lately read A Tale
of Two Cities immediately rereading until as he would have said
he knew it by heart and even at the time he had seen resemblances
between himself and the appealing figure of Carton Now that the
sympathy between them was perfected by Miss Pratts preference for
another William decided to mount the scaffold in place of George
Crooper The scene became actual to him and setting one foot upon a
tin milkpail which some one had carelessly left beside the smokehouse
he lifted his eyes to the pitiless blue sky and unconsciously assumed
the familiar attitude of Carton on the steps of the guillotine He spoke
aloud those great last words

It is a far far better thing that I do than I have ever done it is a
far far better rest that I go to

A whiskered head on the end of a long corrugated red neck protruded
from the smokehouse door

What say it inquired huskily

Nunnothing stammered William

Eyes above whiskers became fierce You take your feet off that
milkbucket Say This heres a sanitary farm Aint you got any more
sense n to go an

But William had abruptly removed his foot and departed

He found the party noisily established in the farmhouse at two long
tables piled with bucolic viands already being violently depleted
Johnnie Watson had kept a chair beside himself vacant for William
Johnnie was in no frame of mind to sit beside any chattering girl
and he had protected himself by Joe Bullitt upon his right and the empty
seat upon his left William took it and gazed upon the nearer foods
with a slight renewal of animation

He began to eat he continued to eat in fact he did well So did his
two comrades Not that the melancholy of these three was dispersedfar
from it With ineffaceable gloom they ate chicken both white meat and
dark drumsticks wishbones and livers they ate cornonthecob many
ears and fried potatoes and green peas and stringbeans they ate peach
preserves and apricot preserves and preserved pears they ate biscuits
with grape jelly and biscuits with crabapple jelly they ate apple sauce
and apple butter and apple pie They ate pickles both cucumber pickles
and pickles made of watermelon rind they ate pickled tomatoes pickled
peppers also pickled onions They ate lemon pie

At that they were no rivals to George Crooper who was a real eater
Love had not made his appetite ethereal today and even the attending
Swedish lady named Anna felt some apprehension when it came to George
and the gravy though she was accustomed to the prodigies performed in
this line by the robust hands on the farm George laid waste his section
of the table and from the beginning he allowed himself scarce time
to say I dunno why it is The pretty companion at his side at first
gazed dumfounded then with growing enthusiasm for what promised to be
a really magnificent performance she began to utter little ejaculations
of wonder and admiration With this music in his ears George outdid
himself He could not resist the temptation to be more and more
astonishing as a heroic comedian for these humors sometimes come upon
vain people at country dinners

George ate when he had eaten more than he needed he ate long after
every one understood why he was so vast he ate on and on sheerly as
a flourishas a spectacle He ate even when he himself began to
understand that there was daring in what he did for his was a toreador
spirit so long as he could keep bright eyes fastened upon him

Finally he ate to decide wagers made upon his gorging though at times
during this last period his joviality deserted him Anon his damp brow
would be troubled and he knew moments of thoughtfulness




XXI

MY LITTLE SWEETHEARTS

When George did stop it was abruptly during one of these intervals of
sobriety and he and Miss Pratt came out of the house together rather
quietly joining one of the groups of young people chatting with
afterdinner languor under the trees However Mr Crooper began to
revive presently in the sweet air of outdoors and observing some
of the more flashing gentlemen lighting cigarettes he was moved to
laughter He had not smoked since his childhoodhaving then been bonded
through to twentyone with a pledge of goldand he feared that these
smoking youths might feel themselves superior Worse Miss Pratt might
be impressed therefore he laughed in scorn saying

Burnin up ole trash around here I expect He sniffed searchingly
Somebodys set some ole rags on fire Then as in discovery he cried
Oh no only cigarettes

Miss Pratt that tactful girl counted four smokers in the group about
her and only one abstainer George She at once defended the smokers
for it is to be feared that numbers always had weight with her Oh but
cigarettes is lubly smell she said Untle Georgiecums maybe be too
ittle boy for smokings

This archness was greeted loudly by the smokers and Mr Crooper was
put upon his mettle He spoke too quickly to consider whether or no the
facts justified his assertion Me I dont smoke paper and ole carpets
I smoke cigars

He had created the right impression for Miss Pratt clapped her hands
Oh plendid Light one Untle Georgiecums Light one ever n ever so
quick Peshus Flopit an me we want see dray big normous man smoke
dray big normous cigar

William and Johnnie Watson who had been hovering morbidly unable to
resist the lodestone came nearer Johnnie being just in time to hear
his cousins reply

II forgot my cigarcase

Johnnies expression became one of biting skepticism What you talkin
about George Didnt you promise Uncle George youd never smoke till
youre of age and Uncle George said hed give you a thousand dollars on
your twentyfirst birthday What d you say about your cigarcase

George felt that he was in a tight place and the lovely eyes of Miss
Pratt turned upon him questioningly He could not flush for he was
already so pink after his exploits with unnecessary nutriment that more
pinkness was impossible He saw that the only safety for him lay in
boisterous prevarication A thousand dollars he laughed loudly I
thought that was real money when I was ten years old It didnt stand in
MY way very long I guess Good ole George wanted his smoke and he went
after it You know how I am Johnnie when I go after anything I been
smokin cigars I dunno how long Glancing about him his eye became
reassured it was obvious that even Johnnie had accepted this airy
statement as the truth and to clinch plausibility he added When I
smoke I smoke I smoke cigars straight alonglight one right on the
stub of the other I only wish I had some with me because I miss em
after a meal Id give a good deal for something to smoke right now I
dont mean cigarettes I dont want any paperI want something thats
all tobacco

Williams pale sad face showed a hint of color With a pang he
remembered the package of My Little Sweetheart AllTobacco Cuban
Cigarettes the Package of Twenty for Ten Cents which still reposed
untouched in the breast pocket of his coat His eyes smarted a little
as he recalled the thoughts and hopes that had accompanied the purchase
but he thought What would Sydney Carton do

William brought forth the package of My Little Sweetheart AllTobacco
Cuban Cigarettes and placed it in the large hand of George Crooper And
this was a noble act for William believed that George really wished to
smoke Here he said take these theyre all tobacco Im goin to
quit smokin anyway And thinking of the name he added gently with
a significance lost upon all his hearers Im sure you ought to have
em instead of me

Then he went away and sat alone upon the fence

Light one light one cried Miss Pratt Evybody mus be happy an
dray big normous man tant be happy less he have his alltobatto
smote Light it light it

George drew as deep a breath as his diaphragm strangely oppressed since
dinner would permit and then bravely lit a Little Sweetheart There
must have been some valiant blood in him for as he exhaled the smoke
he covered a slight choking by exclaiming loudly THATS good Thats
the ole stuff Thats what I was lookin for

Miss Pratt was entranced Oh plendid she cried watching him with
fascinated eyes Now take dray big normous puffs Take dray big
NORMOUS puffs

George took great big enormous puffs

She declared that she loved to watch men smoke and Williams heart as
he sat on the distant fence was wrung and wrung again by the vision of
her playful ecstasies But when he saw her holding what was left of the
first Little Sweetheart for George to light a second at its expiring
spark he could not bear it He dropped from the fence and moped away to
be out of sight once more This was his darkest hour

Studiously avoiding the vicinity of the smokehouse he sought the little
orchard where he had beheld her sitting with George and there he sat
himself in sorrowful reverie upon the selfsame fallen tree How long
he remained there is uncertain but he was roused by the sound of music
which came from the lawn before the farmhouse Bitterly he smiled
remembering that Wallace Banks had engaged Italians with harp violin
and flute promising great things for dancing on a freshclipped lawna
turf floor being no impediment to seventeens dancing Music To see her
whirling and smiling sunnily in the fat grasp of that dancing bear He
would stay in this lonely orchard SHE would not miss him

But though he hated the throbbing music and the sound of the laughing
voices that came to him he could not keep awayand when he reached the
lawn where the dancers were he found Miss Pratt moving rhythmically in
the thin grasp of Wallace Banks Johnnie Watson approached and spoke in
a low tone tinged with spiteful triumph

Well anyway ole fat George didnt get the first dance with her Shes
the guest of honor and Wallace had a right to it because he did all the
work He came up to em and ole fat George couldnt say a thing Wallace
just took her right away from him George didnt say anything at all
but I spose after this dance hell be rushin around again and nobody
else ll have a chance to get near her the rest of the afternoon My
mother told me I ought to invite him over here out I had no business
to do it he dont know the first principles of how to act in a town he
dont live in

Whered he go William asked listlessly for Mr Crooper was nowhere
in sight

I dont knowhe just walked off without sayin anything But hell be
back time this dance is over never you fear and hell grab her again
andWhats the matter with Joe

Joseph Bullitt had made his appearance at a corner of the house some
distance from where they stood His face was alert under the impulse of
strong excitement and he beckoned fiercely Come here And when they
had obeyed Hes around back of the house by a kind of shed said Joe
I think somethings wrong Come on Ill show him to you

But behind the house whither they followed him in vague strange hope
he checked them LOOK THERE he said

His pointing finger was not needed Sounds of paroxysm drew their
attention sufficientlysounds most poignant soulrending and
lugubrious William and Johnnie perceived the large person of Mr
Crooper he was seated upon the ground his back propped obliquely
against the smokehouse though this attitude was not maintained
constantly

Facing him at a little distance a rugged figure in homely garments
stood leaning upon a hoe and regarding George with a cold interest The
apex of this figure was a volcanic straw hat triangular in profile and
coned with an open crater emitting reddish wisps while below the
hat were several features but more whiskers at the top of a long
corrugated red neck of sterling worth A husky voice issued from the
whiskers addressing George

I seen you it said I seen you eatin This here farm is supposed to
be a sanitary farm and youd ought of knew better Go it doggone you
Go it

George complied And three spectators remaining aloof but watching
zealously began to feel their lost faith in Providence returning into
them their faces brightened slowly and without relapse It was a
visible thing how the world became fairer and better in their eyes
during that little while they stood there And William saw that his
Little Sweethearts had been an inspired purchase after all they had
delivered the final tap upon a tottering edifice Georges deeds at
dinner had unsettled but Little Sweethearts had overthrownand now
there was awful work among the ruins to an ironical accompaniment of
music from the front yard where people danced in heavens sunshine

This accompaniment came to a stop and Johnnie Watson jumped He seized
each of his companions by a sleeve and spoke eagerly his eyes glowing
with a warm and brotherly light Here he cried We better get around
therethis looks like it was goin to last all afternoon Joe you
get the next dance with her and just about time the music slows up you
dance her around so you can stop right near where Bill will be standin
so Bill can get her quick for the dance after that Then Bill you do
the same for me and Ill do the same for Joe again and then Joe you
do it for Bill again and then Bill for meand so on If we go in right
now and work together we can crowd the rest out and there wont anybody
else get to dance with her the whole day Come on quick

United in purpose the three ran lightly to the dancinglawn and Mr
Bullitt was successful after a little debate in obtaining the next
dance with the lovely guest of the day I did promise big Untle
Georgiecums she said looking about her

Well I dont think hell come said Joe That is Im pretty sure he
wont

A shade fell upon the exquisite face Noty Bruvva JosieJoe The Men
ALWAYS tum when Lola promises dances Mustnt be rude

Well Joe began when he was interrupted by the Swedish lady named
Anna who spoke to them from the steps of the house Of the merrymakers
they were the nearest

Dot pick fella said Anna dot one dot eatswe make him in a
petroom He holler He tank he neet some halp

Does he want a doctor Joe asked

Doctor No He want make him in a amyoulance for hospital

Ill go look at him Johnnie Watson volunteered running up Hes my
cousin and I guess I got to take the responsibility

Miss Pratt paid the invalid the tribute of one faintly commiserating
glance toward the house Well she said if people would rather eat
too much than dance She meant dance with ME though she thought
it prettier not to say so Come on Bruvva JosieJoe she cried
joyously

And a little later Johnnie Watson approached her where she stood with
a restored and refulgent William about to begin the succeeding dance
Johnnie dropped into her hand a ring receiving one in return I
thought I better GET it he said offering no further explanation
Ill take care of his until we get home Hes all right said Johnnie
and then perceiving a sudden advent of apprehension upon the sensitive
brow of William he went on reassuringly Hes doin as well as anybody
could expect that isafter the crazy way he DID Hes always been
considered the dumbest one in all our relationsnever did know how
to act I dont mean hes exactly not got his senses or ought to be
watched anything like thatand of course he belongs to an awful
good familybut hes just kind of the black sheep when it comes to
intelligence or anything like that I got him as comfortable as a
person could be and theyre givin him hot water and mustard and stuff
but what he needs now is just to be kind of quiet Itll do him a lot o
good Johnnie concluded with a spark in his voice to lay there the
rest of the afternoon and get quieted down kind of

You dont think theres any William began and after a pause
continuedany hopeof his getting strong enough to come out and dance
afterwhile

Johnnie shook his head None in the world he said conclusively The
best we can do for him is to let him entirely alone till after supper
and then ask nobody to sit on the back seat of the trolleycar goin
home so we can make him comfortable back there and let him kind of
stretch out by himself

Then gaily tinkled harp gaily sang flute and violin Over the
greensward William lightly bore his lady while radiant was the cleared
sky above the happy dancers Williams fingers touched those delicate
fingers the exquisite face smiled rosily up to him undreamable
sweetness beat rhythmically upon his glowing ears his feet moved in a
rhapsody of companionship with hers They danced and danced and danced

Then Joe danced with her while William and Johnnie stood with hands
upon each others shoulders and watched mayhap with longing but
without spite then Johnnie danced with her while Joe and William
watchedand then William danced with her again

So passed the long ineffable afternoon awayah Seventeen

 Jav a good time at the trolleyparty the clerk in the corner
drugstore inquired that evening

Fine said William taking his overcoat from the hook where he had
left it

How j like them Little Sweethearts I sold you

FINE said William

FORESHADOWINGS

Now the last rose had blown the dandelion globes were long since on the
wind gladioli and goldenglow and salvia were here the season moved
toward asters and the goldenrod This haloed summer still idled on
its way yet all the while sped quickly like some languid lady in an
elevator

There came a Sundayvery hot

Mr and Mrs Baxter having walked a scorched halfmile from church
drooped thankfully into wicker chairs upon their front porch though
Jane who had accompanied them immediately darted away swinging her
hat by its ribbon and skipping as lithesomely as if she had just come
forth upon a cool morning

I dont know how she does it her father moaned glancing after her
and drying his forehead temporarily upon a handkerchief That would
merely kill me dead after walking in this heat

Then for a time the two were content to sit in silence nodding
to occasional acquaintances who passed in the desultory afterchurch
procession Mr Baxter fanned himself with sporadic little bursts of
energy which made his straw hat creak and Mrs Baxter sighed with the
heat and gently rocked her chair

But as a group of five young people passed along the other side of the
street Mr Baxter abruptly stopped fanning himself and following the
direction of his gaze Mrs Baxter ceased to rock In halfcompleted
attitudes they leaned slightly forward sharing one of those pauses of
parents who unexpectedly behold their offspring

My soul said Williams father Hasnt that girl gone home YET

He looks pale to me Mrs Baxter murmured absently I dont think he
seems at all well lately

During seventeen years Mr Baxter had gradually learned not to protest
anxieties of this kind unless he desired to argue with no prospect
of ever getting a decision Hasnt she got any HOME he demanded
testily Isnt she ever going to quit visiting the Parchers and let
people have a little peace

Mrs Baxter disregarded this outburst as he had disregarded her remark
about Williams pallor You mean Miss Pratt she inquired dreamily
her eyes following the progress of her son No he really doesnt look
well at all

Is she going to visit the Parchers all summer Mr Baxter insisted

She already has about said Mrs Baxter

Look at that boy the father grumbled Mooning along with those other
mooncalvescant even let her go to church alone I wonder how many
weeks of time counting it out in hours hes wasted that way this
summer

Oh I dont know You see he never goes there in the evening

What of that Hes there all day isnt he What do they find to talk
about Thats the mystery to me Day after day hours and hoursMy
soul What do they SAY

Mrs Baxter laughed indulgently People are always wondering that about
the other ages Poor Willie I think that a great deal of the time their
conversation would be probably about as inconsequent as it is now You
see Willie and Joe Bullitt are walking one on each side of Miss Pratt
and Johnnie Watson has to walk behind with May Parcher Joe and Johnnie
are there about as much as Willie is and of course its often his
turn to be nice to May Parcher He hasnt many chances to be teteatete
with Miss Pratt

Well she ought to go home I want that boy to get back into his
senses Hes in an awful state

I think she is going soon said Mrs Baxter The Parchers are to have
a dance for her Friday night and I understand theres to be a floor
laid in the yard and great things Its a farewell party

Thats one mercy anyhow

And if you wonder what they say she resumed why probably theyre
all talking about the party And when Willie IS alone with herwell
what does anybody say Mrs Baxter interrupted herself to laugh Jane
for instanceshes always fascinated by that darky Genesis when hes
at work here in the yard and they have long long talks Ive seen them
from the window What on earth do you suppose they talk about Thats
where Jane is now She knew I told Genesis Id give him something if
hed come and freeze the icecream for us today and when we got here
she heard the freezer and hopped right around there If you went out to
the back porch youd find them talking steadilybut what on earth about
I couldnt guess to save my life

And yet nothing could have been simpler as a matter of fact Jane and
Genesis attended by Clematis were talking about society That is to
say their discourse was not sociologic rather it was of the frivolous
and elegant Watteau prevailed with them over John Stuart Millin a
word they spoke of the beau monde

Genesis turned the handle of the freezer with his left hand allowing
his right the freedom of gesture which was an intermittent necessity
when he talked In the matter of dress Genesis had always been among
the most informal of his race but today there was a change almost
unnerving to the Caucasian eye He wore a balloonish suit of purple
strangely scalloped at pocket and cuff and more strangely decorated
with lines of small parasite buttons in color blue obviously buttons
of leisure His bulbous new shoes flashed back yellow fire at the
embarrassed sun and his collar for he had gone so far sent forth
other sparkles playing upon a polished surface over an inner graining
of soot Beneath it hung a simple white soiled evening tie draped in
a manner unintended by its manufacturer and heavily overburdened by a
green glass medallion of the Emperor Tiberius set in brass

Yesm said Genesis Now Im in at Swimflyin roun evy night wif
all lem bluevein peopleI say Mus go buy me some bluevein cloes
Ef Im gon a START mights well start HIGH So firs I buy me
thishere gol necktie pin wi thishere ladys face carved out o green

window Ef you wish to be besdress man in town take me home fer six
dolluhs ninetysevum cents Ats kine o suit Genesis need I say

Jane nodded gravely comprehending the reasonableness of this view
What made you decide to start Genesis she asked earnestly I mean
how did it happen you began to get this way

Well suh tall come bout right like kine o slidin into it stid

you make cuttin grass daytime Well suh Iz stan up doin at
nouncin vey nex night White lady an gelmun walk todes my do I
step up to emI step up to em thisaway

Here Genesis found it pleasant to present the scene with some
elaboration He dropped the handle of the freezer rose assumed a
stately but ingratiating expression and stepped up to the imagined
couple using a pacing and rhythmic gaita conservative prance which
plainly indicated the simultaneous operation of an orchestra Then
bending graciously as though the persons addressed were of dwarfish
stature Scuse me he said but kin I please be so plite as to
quiah you name For a moment he listened attentively then nodded
and returning with the same aristocratic undulations to an imaginary
doorway near the freezer Misto an Missuz Orlosko Rinktum he
proclaimed sonorously

WHO cried Jane fascinated Genesis nounce that again right
away

Genesis heartily complied

Misto an Missuz Orlosko Rinktum he bawled

Was that really their names she asked eagerly

freezer Seem like I rickalect SOMEBODY got name good deal like what I

Jane looked at him thoughtfully Do you like it better than cuttin

quiet on Sunday nights dont you

Oh I bet thats the party for Miss Pratt at Mr Parchers Jane
cried Didnt I guess right

Yesm I reckon Im agon a see one you famly at night see him
dancinwait on him at refeshmuns

Janes expression became even more serious than usual Willie I dont
know whether hes goin Genesis

Lan name Genesis exclaimed He die ef he don git INvite to at
ball

Oh hes invited said Jane Only I think maybe he wont go

My gooness Why ain he goin

Jane looked at her friend studiously before replying Well its a
secret she said finally but its a very intersting one an Ill
tell you if you never tell

Yesm I ain tellin nobody

Jane glanced round then stepped a little closer and told the secret
with the solemnity it deserved Well when Miss Pratt first came to
visit Miss May Parcher Willie used to keep papas evening cloes in
his windowseat an mamma wondered what HAD become of em Then after
dinner hed slip up there an put em on him an go out through the
kitchen an call on Miss Pratt Then mamma found em an she thought he
oughtnt to do that so she didnt tell him or anything an she didnt
even tell papa but she had the tailor make em ever an ever so much
bigger cause they were gettin too tight for papa An well so after
that even if Willie could get em out o mammas cloescloset where
she keeps em now hed look so funny in em he couldnt wear em Well
an then he couldnt go to pay calls on Miss Pratt in the evening since
then because mamma says after he started to go there in that suit he
couldnt go without it or maybe Miss Pratt or the other ones thats in
love of her would think it was pretty queer an maybe kind of expeck it
was papas all the time Mamma says she thinks Willie must have worried
a good deal over reasons to say why hed always go in the daytime after
that an never came in the evening an now theyre goin to have this
party an she says hes been gettin paler and paler every day since
he heard about it Mamma says hes pale SOME because Miss Pratts goin
away but she thinks its a good deal more because well if he would
wear those evening cloes just to go CALLIN how would it be to go to
that PARTY an not have any Thats what mamma thinksan Genesis you
promised youd never tell as long as you live

Yesm _I_ ain tellin Genesis chuckled Im agon agit me one
nem waituh suits befo long mysef sos I kin quit wearin at ole
Henry Gimlet suit what blong to Fanny an have me a privut suit o
my own Theys a seconhan sto ovuh on the avynoo where they got
swallertail suits all way fum sevum dolluhs to nineteem dolluhs an
ninetyeight cents Im a

Jane started interrupting him SH she whispered laying a finger
warningly upon her lips

William had entered the yard at the back gate and approaching over the
lawn had arrived at the steps of the porch before Jane perceived
him She gave him an apprehensive look but he passed into the house
absentmindedly not even flinching at sight of Clematisand Mrs
Baxter was right William did look pale

I guess he didnt hear us said Jane when he had disappeared into the
interior He acks awful funny she added thoughtfully First when he
was in love of Miss Pratt hed be mad about somepm almost every minute
he was home Couldnt anybody say ANYthing to him but hed just behave
as if it was frightful an then if youd see him out walkin with Miss
Pratt well hed look likelike Jane paused her eye fell upon
Clematis and by a happy inspiration she was able to complete her simile
with remarkable accuracy Hed look like the way Clematis looks at
people Thats just EXACTLY the way hed look Genesis when he was
walkin with Miss Pratt an then when he was home he got so quiet he
couldnt answer questions an wouldnt hear what anybody said to him
at table or anywhere an papa d nearly almost bust Mamma n papa d
talk an talk about it anshe lowered her voicean I knew what
they were talkin about Well an then hed hardly ever get mad any
more hed just sit in his room an sometimes hed sit in there without
any light or hed sit out in the yard all by himself all evening
maybe an thother evening after I was in bed I heard em an papa
saidwell this is what papa told mamma And again lowering her
voice she proffered the quotation from her father in atone somewhat
awestruck Papa said by Gosh if he ever a thought a son of his
could make such a Word idiot of himself he almost wished wed both been
girls

Having completed this report in a violent whisper Jane nodded
repeatedly for emphasis and Genesis shook his head to show that he was
as deeply impressed as she wished him to be I guess she added after
a pause I guess Willie didnt hear anything you an I talked about him
or cloes or anything

She was mistaken in part William had caught no reference to himself
but he had overheard something and he was now alone in his room
thinking about it almost feverishly A seconhan sto ovuh on the
avynoo where they got swallertail suits all way fum sevum dolluhs to
nineteem dolluhs an ninetyeight cents

 Civilization is responsible for certain longings in the breast
of manartificial longings but sometimes as poignant as hunger and
thirst Of these the strongest are those of the maid for the bridal
veil of the lad for long trousers and of the youth for a tailed coat
of state To the gratification of this last only a few of the early
joys in life are comparable Indulged youths too rich can know to the
unctuous full neither the longing nor the gratification but one such
as William in moderate circumstances is privileged to pant for his
first evening clothes as the hart panteth after the waterbrookand
sometimes to pant in vain Also this was a crisis in Williams
life in addition to his yearning for such apparel he was racked by a
passionate urgency

As Jane had so precociously understood unless he should somehow manage
to obtain the proper draperies he could not go to the farewell dance
for Miss Pratt Other unequipped boys could go in their ordinary best
clothes but William could not for alack he had dressed too well too
soon

He was in desperate case

The sorrow of the approaching great departure was but the heavier
because it had been so long deferred To William it had seemed that this
flowerstrewn summer could actually end no more than he could actually
die but Time had begun its awful lecture and even Seventeen was
listening

Miss Pratt that magic girl was going home




XXIII

FATHERS FORGET

To the competent twenties hundreds of miles suggesting no
impossibilities such departures may be rending but not tragic
Implacable the difference to Seventeen Miss Pratt was going home and
Seventeen could not follow it could only mourn upon the lonely shore
tracing little angelic footprints left in the sand

To Seventeen such a departure is final it is a vanishing

And now it seemed possible that William might be deprived even of the
last romantic consolations of the last waltz together of the last
last listening to music in the moonlight together of all those sacred
lasts of the last evening together

He had pleaded strongly for a dresssuit as a fitting recognition
of his seventeenth birthday anniversary but he had been denied by
his father with a jocularity more crushing than rigor Since thenin
particular since the arrival of Miss PrattMr Baxters temper had been
growing steadily more and more even That is as affected by Williams
social activities it was uniformly bad Nevertheless after heavy
brooding William decided to make one final appeal before he resorted to
measures which the necessities of despair had caused him to contemplate

He wished to give himself every chance for a good effect therefore he
did not act hastily but went over what he intended to say rehearsing
it with a few appropriate gestures and even taking some pleasure in the
pathetic dignity of this performance as revealed by occasional
glances at the mirror of his dressingtable In spite of these little
alleviations his trouble was great and all too real for unhappily
the previous rehearsal of an emotional scene does not prove the emotion
insincere

Descending he found his father and mother still sitting upon the front
porch Then standing before them solemneyed he uttered a preluding
cough and began

Father he said in a loud voice I have come to

Dear me Mrs Baxter exclaimed not perceiving that she was
interrupting an intended oration Willie you DO look pale Sit down
poor child you oughtnt to walk so much in this heat

Father William repeated Fath

I suppose you got her safely home from church Mr Baxter said She
might have been carried off by footpads if you three boys hadnt been
along to take care of her

But William persisted heroically Father he said Father I have
come to

What on earths the matter with you Mr Baxter ceased to fan himself
Mrs Baxter stopped rocking and both stared for it had dawned upon
them that something unusual was beginning to take place

William backed to the start and tried it again Father I have come
to He paused and gulped evidently expecting to be interrupted
but both of his parents remained silent regarding him with puzzled
surprise Father he began once more I have comeI have come
toto place before you something I think its your duty as my father
to undertake and I have thought over this step before laying it before
you

My soul said Mr Baxter under his breath My soul

At my age William continued swallowing and fixing his earnest eyes
upon the roof of the porch to avoid the disconcerting stare of his
fatherat my age theres some things that ought to be done and some
things that ought not to be done If you asked me what I thought OUGHT
to be done there is only one answer When anybody as old as I am has
to go out among other young men his own age that already got one like
anyway half of them HAVE who I go with and their fathers have already
taken such a step because they felt it was the only right thing to
do because at my age and the young men I go withs age it IS the only
right thing to do because that is something nobody could deny at my
age Here William drew a long breath and deciding to abandon that
sentence as irrevocably tangled began another I have thought over
this step because there comes a time to every young man when they must
lay a step before their father before something happens that they would
be sorry for I have thought this undertaking over and I am certain it
would be your honest duty

My soul gasped Mr Baxter I thought I knew you pretty well but you
talk like a stranger to ME What is all this What you WANT

A dresssuit said William

He had intended to say a great deal more before coming to the point
but although through nervousness he had lost some threads of his
rehearsed plea it seemed to him that he was getting along well and
putting his case with some distinction and power He was surprised and
hurt therefore to hear his father utter a wordless shout in a tone of
wondering derision

I have more to say William began

But Mr Baxter cut him off A dresssuit he cried Well Im glad
you were talking about SOMETHING because I honestly thought it must be
too much sun

At this the troubled William brought his eyes down from the porch roof
and forgot his rehearsal He lifted his hand appealingly Father he
said I GOT to have one

Got to Mr Baxter laughed a laugh that chilled the supplicant
through and through At your age I thought I was lucky if I had ANY
suit that was fit to be seen in Youre too young Willie I dont want
you to get your mind on such stuff and if I have my way you wont have
a dresssuit for four years more anyhow

Father I GOT to have one I got to have one right away The urgency
in Williams voice was almost tearful I dont ask you to have it made
or to go to expensive tailors but theres plenty of good readymade
ones that only cost about forty dollars theyre advertised in the
paper Father wouldnt you spend just forty dollars Ill pay it back
when Im in business Ill work

Mr Baxter waved all this aside Its not the money Its the principle
that Im standing for and I dont intend

Father WONT you do it

No I will not

William saw that sentence had been passed and all appeals for a new
trial denied He choked and rushed into the house without more ado

Poor boy his mother said

Poor boy nothing fumed Mr Baxter Hes about lost his mind over
that Miss Pratt Think of his coming out here and starting a regular
debating society declamation before his mother and father Why I never
heard anything like it in my life I dont like to hurt his feelings
and Id give him anything I could afford that would do him any good
but all he wants it for now is to splurge around in at this party before
that little yellowhaired girl I guess he can wear the kind of clothes
most of the other boys wearthe kind _I_ wore at partiesand never
thought of wearing anything else Whats the world getting to be
like Seventeen years old and throws a fit because he cant have a
dresssuit

Mrs Baxter looked thoughtful Butbut suppose he felt he couldnt go
to the dance unless he wore one poor boy

All the better said Mr Baxter firmly Do him good to keep away and
get his mind on something else

Of course she suggested with some timidity forty dollars isnt a
great deal of money and a readymade suit just to begin with

Naturally Mr Baxter perceived whither she was drifting Forty dollars
isnt a thousand he interrupted but what you want to throw it away
for One reason a boy of seventeen oughtnt to have evening clothes
is the way he behaves with ANY clothes Forty dollars Why only this
summer he sat down on Janes open paintbox twice in one week

WellMiss Pratt IS going away and the dance will be her last night
Im afraid it would really hurt him to miss it I remember once before
we were engagedthat evening before papa took me abroad and you

Its no use mamma he said We were both in the twentieswhy _I_
was six years older than Willie even then Theres no comparison at
all Ill let him order a dresssuit on his twentyfirst birthday and
not a minute before I dont believe in it and I intend to see that
he gets all this stuff out of his system Hes got to learn some hard
sense

Mrs Baxter shook her head doubtfully but she said no more Perhaps she
regretted a little that she had caused Mr Baxters evening clothes to
be so expansively enlargedfor she looked rather regretful She also
looked rather incomprehensible not to say cryptic during the long
silence which followed and Mr Baxter resumed his rocking unaware of
the fixity of gaze which his wife maintained upon hima thing the most
loyal will do sometimes

The incomprehensible look disappeared before long but the regretful
one was renewed in the mothers eyes whenever she caught glimpses of her
son that day and at the table where Williams manner was gentleeven
toward his heartless father

Underneath that gentleness the harried self of William was no longer
debating a desperate resolve but had fixed upon it and on the
following afternoon Jane chanced to be a witness of some resultant
actions She came to her mother with an account of them

Mamma what you spose Willie wants of those two ole marketbaskets
that were down cellar

Why Jane

Well he carried em in his room an then he saw me lookin an he
said Gway from here an shut the door He looks so funny Whats he
want of those ole baskets mamma

I dont know Perhaps he doesnt even know himself Jane

But William did know definitely He had set the baskets upon chairs
and now with pale determination he was proceeding to fill them When
his task was completed the two baskets contained

One heavyweight winter suit of clothes

One lightweight summer suit of clothes

One cap

One straw hat

Two pairs of white flannel trousers

Two Madras shirts

Two flannel shirts

Two silk shirts

Seven soft collars

Three silk neckties

One crocheted tie

Eight pairs of socks

One pair of patentleather shoes

One pair of tennisshoes

One overcoat

Some underwear

One twofoot shelf of books consisting of several sterling works
upon mathematics in a damaged condition five of Shakespeares plays
expurgated for schools and colleges and also damaged a work upon
political economy and another upon the science of physics Websters
Collegiate Dictionary How to Enter a DrawingRoom and Five Hundred
Other Hints Witty Sayings from Here and There Lorna Doone Quentin
Durward The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes a very old copy of Moths
and a small Bible

William spread handkerchiefs upon the two overbulging cargoes that
their nature might not be disclosed to the curious and after listening
a moment at his door took the baskets one upon each arm then went
quickly down the stairs and out of the house out of the yard and into
the alleyby which route he had modestly chosen to travel

 After an absence of about two hours he returned emptyhanded
and anxious Mother I want to speak to you he said addressing Mrs
Baxter in a voice which clearly proved the strain of these racking days
I want to speak to you about something important

Yes Willie

Please send Jane away I cant talk about important things with a child
in the room

Jane naturally wished to stay since he was going to say something
important Mamma do I HAF to go

Just a few minutes dear

Jane walked submissively out of the door leaving it open behind her
Then having gone about six feet farther she halted and preserving a
breathless silence consoled herself for her banishment by listening to
what was said hearing it all as satisfactorily as if she had remained
in the room Quiet thoughtful children like Jane avail themselves of
these little pleasures oftener than is suspected

Mother said William with great intensity I want to ask you please
to lend me three dollars and sixty cents

What for Willie

Mother I just ask you to lend me three dollars and sixty cents

But what FOR

Mother I dont feel I can discuss it any I simply ask you Will you
lend me three dollars and sixty cents

Mrs Baxter laughed gently I dont think I could Willie but
certainly I should want to know what for

Mother I am going on eighteen years of age and when I ask for a
small sum of money like three dollars and sixty cents I think I might be
trusted to know how to use it for my own good without having to answer
questions like a ch

Why Willie she exclaimed you ought to have plenty of money of your
own

Of course I ought he agreed warmly If youd ask father to give me
a regular allow

No no I mean you ought to have plenty left out of that old junk and
furniture I let you sell last month You had over nine dollars

That was five weeks ago William explained wearily

But you certainly must have some of it left Why it was MORE than nine
dollars I believe I think it was nearer ten Surely you havent

Ye gods cried the goaded William A person going on eighteen
years old ought to be able to spend nine dollars in five weeks without
everybodys acting like it was a crime Mother I ask you the simple
question Will you PLEASE lend me three dollars and sixty cents

I dont think I ought to dear Im sure your father wouldnt wish
me to unless youll tell me what you want it for In fact I wont
consider it at all unless you do tell me

You wont do it he quavered

She shook her head gently You see dear Im afraid the reason you
dont tell me is because you know that I wouldnt give it to you if I
knew what you wanted it for

This perfect diagnosis of the case so disheartened him that after a few
monosyllabic efforts to continue the conversation with dignity he gave
it up and left in such a preoccupation with despondency that he passed
the surprised Jane in the hall without suspecting what she had been
doing

That evening after dinner he addressed to his father an impassioned
appeal for three dollars and sixty cents laying such stress of pathos
on his principal argument that if he couldnt have a dresssuit at
least he ought to be given three dollars and sixty CENTS the emphasis
is Williams that Mr Baxter was moved in the direction of consentbut
not far enough Id like to let you have it Willie he said excusing
himself for refusal but your mother felt SHE oughtnt to do it unless
youd say what you wanted it for and Im sure she wouldnt like me to
do it I cant let you have it unless you get her to say she wants me
to

Thus advised the unfortunate made another appeal to his mother the next
day and having brought about no relaxation of the situation again
petitioned his father on the following evening So it went the torn
and driven William turning from parent to parent and surely since the
world began the special sum of three dollars and sixty cents has never
been so often mentioned in any one house and in the same space of time
as it was in the house of the Baxters during Monday Tuesday Wednesday
and Thursday of that oppressive week

But on Friday William disappeared after breakfast and did not return to
lunch

CLOTHES MAKE THE MAN

Mrs Baxter was troubled During the afternoon she glanced often from
the open window of the room where she had gone to sew but the peaceful
neighborhood continued to be peaceful and no sound of the harassed
footsteps of William echoed from the pavement However she saw Genesis
arrive in his weekday costume to do some weeding and Jane immediately
skip forth for mingled purposes of observation and conversation

What DO they say thought Mrs Baxter observing that both Jane and
Genesis were unusually animated But for once that perplexity was to be
dispersed After an exciting halfhour Jane came flying to her mother
breathless

Mamma she cried I know where Willie is Genesis told me cause he
saw him an he talked to him while he was doin it

Doing what Where

Mamma listen What you think Willies doin I bet you cant g

Jane Mrs Baxter spoke sharply Tell me what Genesis said at once

Yesm Willies sittin in a lumberyard that Genesis comes by on his
way from over on the avynoo where all the colored people livean hes
countin knotholes in shingles

He is WHAT

Yesm Genesis knows all about it because he was thinkin of doin
it himself only he says it would be too slow This is the way it is
mamma Listen mamma because this is just exackly the way it is Well
this lumberyard man got into some sort of a fuss because he bought
millions an millions of shingles mamma that had too many knots in
an the man dont want to pay for em or else the store where he bought
em wont take em back an they got to prove how many shingles are
bad shingles or somepm an anyway mamma thats what Willies doin
Every time he comes to a bad shingle mamma he puts it somewheres else
or somepm like that mamma an every time hes put a thousand bad
shingles in this other place they give him six cents He gets the six
cents to keep mammaan thats what hes been doin all day

Good gracious

Oh but thats nothing mammajust you wait till you hear the rest
THAT part of it isnt anything a TALL mamma You wouldnt hardly notice
that part of it if you knew the other part of it mamma Why that
isnt ANYTHING Jane made demonstrations of scorn for the insignificant
information already imparted

Jane

Yesm

I want to know everything Genesis told you said her mother and I
want you to tell it as quickly as you can

Well I AM tellin it mamma Jane protested Im just BEGINNING to
tell it I cant tell it unless theres a beginning can I How could
there be ANYTHING unless you had to begin it mamma

Try your best to go on Jane

Yesm Well Genesis saysMamma Jane interrupted herself with a
little outcry Oh I bet THATS what he had those two marketbaskets
for Yes sir Thats just what he did An then he needed the rest
o the money an you an papa wouldnt give him any an so he began
countin shingles today cause tonights the night of the party an he
just HASS to have it

Mrs Baxter who had risen to her feet recalled the episode of the
baskets and sank into a chair How did Genesis know Willie wanted forty
dollars and if Willies pawned something how did Genesis know THAT Did
Willie tell Gen

Oh no mamma Willie didnt want forty dollarsonly fourteen

But he couldnt get even the cheapest readymade dresssuit for fourteen
dollars

Mamma youre gettin it all mixed up Jane cried Listen mamma
Genesis knows all about a secondhand store over on the avynoo an it
keeps most everything an Genesis says its the nicest store It keeps
waiter suits all the way up to nineteen dollars and ninetynine cents
Well an Genesis wants to get one of those suits so he goes in there
all the time an talks to the man an bargains an bargains with him
cause Genesis says this man is the bargainest man in the wide worl
mamma Thats what Genesis says Well an so this mans name is Oneeye
Beljus mamma Thats his name an Genesis says so Well an so this
man that Genesis told me about that keeps the storeI mean Oneeye
Beljus mammawell Oneeye Beljus had Willies name written down in a
book an he knew Genesis worked for famlies that have boys like Willie
in em an this morning Oneeye Beljus showed Genesis Willies name
written down in this book an Oneeye Beljus asked Genesis if he knew
anybody by that name an all about him Well an so at first Genesis
pretended he was tryin to remember because he wanted to find out what
Willie went there for Genesis didnt tell any stories mamma he
just pretended he couldnt remember an so well Oneeye Beljus kept
talkin an pretty soon Genesis found out all about it Oneeye Beljus
said Willie came in there an tried on the coat of one of those waiter
suits

Oh no gasped Mrs Baxter

Yesm an Oneeye Beljus said it was the only one that would fit
Willie an Oneeye Beljus told Willie that suit was worth fourteen
dollars an Willie said he didnt have any money but hed like to
trade something else for it Well an so Oneeye Beljus said this was
an awful fine suit an the only one he had that had blonged to a white
gentleman Well an so they bargained an bargained an bargained
an BARGAINED An then well an so at last Willie said hed go an
get everything that blonged to him an Oneeye Beljus could pick out
enough to make fourteen dollars worth an then Willie could have
the suit Well an so Willie came home an put everything he had that
blonged to him into those two baskets mammathats just what he
did cause Genesis says he told Oneeye Beljus it was everything that
blonged to him an that would take two baskets mamma Well then
an so he told Oneeye Beljus to pick out fourteen dollars worth an
Oneeye Beljus ast Willie if he didnt have a watch Well Willie took
out his watch an Oneeye Beljus said it was an awful bad watch but he
would put it in for a dollar an he said Ill put your necktie pin
in for forty cents more so Willie took it out of his necktie an then
Oneeye Beljus said it would take all the things in the baskets to make
I forget how much mamma an the watch would be a dollar more an the
pin forty cents an that would leave just three dollars an sixty cents
more for Willie to pay before he could get the suit

Mrs Baxters face had become suffused with high color but she wished
to know all that Genesis had said and mastering her feelings with an
effort she told Jane to proceeda command obeyed after Jane had taken
several long breaths

Well an so the worst part of it is Genesis says its because that
suit is haunted

What

Yesm said Jane solemnly Genesis says its haunted Genesis says
everybody over on the avynoo knows all about that suit an he says
thats why Oneeye Beljus never could sell it before Genesis says
Oneeye Beljus tried to sell it to a colored man for three dollars
but the man said he wouldnt put in on for three hunderd dollars an
Genesis says HE wouldnt either because it belonged to a Dago waiter
thatthat Janes voice sank to a whisper of unctuous horror She was
having a wonderful time Mamma this Dago waiter he lived over on the
avynoo an he took a caseknife hed sharpenedAN HE CUT A LADYS
HEAD OFF WITH IT

Mrs Baxter screamed faintly

An he got hung mamma If you dont believe it you can ask Oneeye
BeljusI guess HE knows An you can ask

Hush

An he sold this suit to Oneeye Beljus when he was in jail mamma He
sold it to him before he got hung mamma

Hush Jane

But Jane couldnt hush now An he had that suit on when he cut the
ladys head off mamma an thats why its haunted They cleaned it all
up excep a few little spots of bl

JANE shouted her mother You must not talk about such things and
Genesis mustnt tell you stories of that sort

Well how could he help it if he told me about Willie Jane urged
reasonably

Never mind Did that crazy chDid Willie LEAVE the baskets in that
dreadful place

Yesman his watch an pin Jane informed her impressively An
Oneeye Beljus wanted to know if Genesis knew Willie because Oneeye
Beljus wanted to know if Genesis thought Willie could get the three
dollars an sixty cents an Oneeye Beljus wanted to know if Genesis
thought he could get anything more out of him besides that He told
Genesis he hadnt told Willie he COULD have the suit after all he just
told him he THOUGHT he could but he wouldnt say for certain till he
brought him the three dollars an sixty cents So Willie left all his
things there an his watch an

That will do Mrs Baxters voice was sharper than it had ever been in
Janes recollection I dont need to hear any moreand I dont WANT to
hear any more

Jane was justly aggrieved But mamma it isnt MY fault

Mrs Baxters lips parted to speak but she checked herself Fault
she said gravely I wonder whose fault it really is

And with that she went hurriedly into Williams room and made a brief
inspection of his clothescloset and dressingtable Then as Jane
watched her in awed silence she strode to the window and called
loudly

Genesis

Yesm came the voice from below

Go to that lumberyard where Mr William is at work and bring him
here to me at once If he declines to come tell him Her voice broke
oddly she choked but Jane could not decide with what emotion Tell
himtell him I ordered you to use force if necessary Hurry

YESM

Jane ran to the window in time to see Genesis departing seriously
through the back gate

Mamma

Dont talk to me now Jane Mrs Baxter said crisply I want you to
go down in the yard and when Willie comes tell him Im waiting for him
here in his own room And dont come with him Jane Run

Yes mamma Jane was pleased with this appointment she anxiously
desired to be the first to see how Willie looked

 He looked flurried and flustered and breathless and there were
blisters upon the reddened palms of his hands What on earths the
matter mother he asked as he stood panting before her Genesis said
something was wrong and he said you told him to hit me if I wouldnt
come

Oh NO she cried I only meant I thought perhaps you wouldnt obey
any ordinary message

Well well it doesnt matter but please hurry and say what you want
to because I got to get back and

No Mrs Baxter said quietly youre not going back to count any
more shingles Willie How much have you earned

He swallowed but spoke bravely Thirtysix cents But Ive been
getting lots faster the last two hours and theres a good deal of time
before six oclock Mother

No she said Youre going over to that horrible place where youve
left your clothes and your watch and all those other things in the two
baskets and youre going to bring them home at once

Mother he cried aghast Who told you

It doesnt matter You dont want your father to find out do you Then
get those things back here as quickly as you can Theyll have to be
fumigated after being in that den

Theyve never been out of the baskets he protested hotly except
just to be looked at Theyre MY things mother and I had a right to
do what I needed to with em didnt I His utterance became difficult
You and father just CANT understandand you wont do anything to help
me

Willie you can go to the party she said gently You didnt need
those frightful clothes at all

I do he cried I GOT to have em I CANT go in my day cloes
Theres a reason you wouldnt understand why I cant I just CANT

Yes she said you can go to the party

I cant either Not unless you give me three dollars and twentyfour
cents or unless I can get back to the lumberyard and earn the rest
before

No And the warm color that had rushed over Mrs Baxter during Janes
sensational recital returned with a vengeance Her eyes flashed If
youd rather I sent a policeman for those baskets Ill send one I
should prefer to do itmuch And to have that rascal arrested If you
dont want me to send a policeman you can go for them yourself but
you must start within ten minutes because if you dont Ill telephone
headquarters Ten minutes Willie and I mean it

He cried out protesting She would make him a thing of scorn forever
and soil his honor if she sent a policeman Mr Beljus was a fair
and honest tradesman he explained passionately and had not made the
approaches in this matter Also the garments in question though not
entirely new nor of the highest mode were of good material and in
splendid condition Unmistakably they were evening clothes and such a
bargain at fourteen dollars that William would guarantee to sell them
for twenty after he had worn them this one evening Mr Beljus himself
had said that he would not even think of letting them go at fourteen
to anybody else and as for the two poor baskets of worn and useless
articles offered in exchange and a bent scarfpin and a wornout old
silver watch that had belonged to greatuncle Benwhy the ten dollars
and forty cents allowed upon them was beyond all ordinary liberality
it was almost charity There was only one place in town where evening
clothes were rented and the suspicious persons in charge had insisted
that William obtain from his father a guarantee to insure the return of
the garments in perfect condition So that was hopeless And wasnt it
better also to wear clothes which had known only one previous occupant
as was the case with Mr Beljuss offering than to hire what chance
hundreds had hired Finally there was only one thing to be considered
and this was the fact that William HAD to have those clothes

Six minutes said Mrs Baxter glancing implacably at her watch When
its ten Ill telephone

And the end of it was of course victory for the womanvictory both
moral and physical Threequarters of an hour later she was unburdening
the contents of the two baskets and putting the things back in place
illuminating these actions with an expression of strong distastein
spite of broken assurances that Mr Beljus had not more than touched any
of the articles offered to him for valuation

 At dinner which was unusually early that evening Mrs Baxter did
not often glance toward her son she kept her eyes from that white face
and spent most of her time in urging upon Mr Baxter that he should
be prompt in dressing for a cardclub meeting which he and she were
to attend that evening These admonitions of hers were continued so
pressingly that Mr Baxter after protesting that there was no use in
being a whole hour too early groaningly went to dress without even
reading his paper

William had retired to his own room where he lay upon his bed in the
darkness He heard the evening noises of the house faintly through the
closed door voices and the clatter of metal and china from the faraway
kitchen Janes laugh in the hall the opening and closing of the doors
Then his father seemed to be in distress about something William heard
him complaining to Mrs Baxter and though the words were indistinct
the tone was vigorously plaintive Mrs Baxter laughed and appeared
to make light of his troubles whatever they wereand presently
their footsteps were audible from the stairway the front door closed
emphatically and they were gone

Everything was quiet now The open window showed as a greenish oblong
set in black and William knew that in a little while there would come
through the stillness of that window the distant sound of violins That
was a moment he dreaded with a dread that ached And as he lay on his
dreary bed he thought of brightly lighted rooms where other boys were
dressing eagerly faces and hair shining hearts beating highboys who
would possess this last evening and the last waltz together the last
smile and the last sigh

It did not once enter his mind that he could go to the dance in his
best suit or that possibly the other young people at the party would
be too busy with their own affairs to notice particularly what he wore
It was the unquestionable and granite fact to his mind that the whole
derisive World would know the truth about his earlier appearances in his
fathers clothes And that was a form of ruin not to be faced In the
protective darkness and seclusion of Williams bedroom it is possible
that smarting eyes relieved themselves by blinking rather energetically
it is even possible that there was a minute damp spot upon the pillow
Seventeen cannot always manage the little boy yet alive under all the
coverings

Now arrived that moment he had most painfully anticipated and
dancemusic drifted on the nightbut there came a tapping upon his
door and a soft voice spoke

Willee

With a sharp exclamation William swung his legs over the edge of the
bed and sat up Of all things he desired not he desired no conversation
with or on the part of Jane But he had forgotten to lock his
doorthe handle turned and a dim little figure marched in

Willie Adelias goin to put me to bed

You gway from here he said huskily I havent got time to talk to
you Im busy

Well you can wait a minute cant you she asked reasonably I haf
to tell you a joke on mamma

I dont want to hear any jokes

Well I HAF to tell you this one cause she told me to Oh Jane
clapped her hand over her mouth and jumped up and down offering a
fantastic silhouette against the light of the Open door Oh oh OH

Whats matter

She said I mustnt MUSTNT tell that she told me to tell My goodness
I forgot that Mamma took me off alone right after dinner an she told
me to tell you this joke on her a little after she an papa had left
the house but she said Above all THINGS she said DONT let Willie
know _I_ said to tell him Thats just what she said an here thats
the very first thing I had to go an do

Well what of it

Jane quieted down The pangs of her remorse were lost in her love of
sensationalism and her voice sank to the thrilling whisper which it was
one of her greatest pleasures to use Did you hear what a fuss papa was
makin when he was dressin for the cardparty

_I_ dont care if

He had to go in his reglar cloes whispered Jane triumphantly
An this is the joke on mamma you know that tailor that let papas
dresssuit way way out well Mamma thinks that tailor must think
shes crazy or somepm cause she took papas dresssuit to him last
Monday to get it pressed for this cardparty an she guesses he must of
understood her to tell him to do lots besides just pressin it Anyway
he went an altered it an he took it way way IN again an this
afternoon when it came back it was even tighter n what it was in the
first place an papa couldnt BEGIN to get into it Well an so its
all pressed an evything an she stopped on the way out an whispered
to me that shed got so upset over the joke on her that she couldnt
remember where she put it when she took it out o papas room after he
gave up tryin to get inside of it An that cried Janethats
the funniest thing of all Why its layin right on her bed this very
minute

In one bound William leaped through the open door Two seconds sufficed
for his passage through the hall to his mothers bedroomand there
neatly spread upon the lace coverlet and brighter than coronation robes
fairer than Josephs holy coat It lay

YOUTH AND MR PARCHER

As a hurried worldling in almost perfectly fitting evening clothes
passed out of his fathers gateway and hurried toward the place whence
faintly came the sound of dancemusic a childs voice called sweetly
from an unidentified window of the darkened house behind him

Well ANYWAY you try and have a good time Willie

William made no reply he paused not in his stride Janes farewell
injunction though obviously not illintended seemed in poor taste and
a reply might have encouraged her to believe that in some measure at
least he condescended to discuss his inner life with her He departed
rapidly but with hauteur The moon was up but shadetrees were thick
along the sidewalk and the hauteur was invisible to any human eye
nevertheless William considered it necessary

Janes friendly but illchosen ANYWAY had touched doubts already
annoying him He was certain to be late to the partyso late indeed
that it might prove difficult to obtain a proper number of dances with
the sacred girl in whose honor the celebration was being held Too
many were steeped in a sense of her sacredness well he wot and he was
unable to find room in his apprehensive mind for any doubt that these
others would be accursedly diligent

But as he hastened onward his spirits rose and he did reply to Jane
after all though he had placed a hundred yards between them

Yes and you can bet your bottom dollar I will too he muttered
between his determined teeth

The very utterance of the words increased the firmness of his decision
and at the same time cheered him His apprehensions fell away and a
glamorous excitement took their place as he turned a corner and the
music burst more loudly upon his tingling ear For there not halfway
to the next street the fairy scene lay spread before him

Spellbound groups of uninvited persons most of them colored rested
their forearms upon the upper rail of the Parchers picket fence
offering to Williams view a silhouette like that of a crowd at a fire
Beyond the fence bright forms went skimming shimmering wavering over
a white platform while high overhead the young moon sprayed a thinner
light down through the maple leaves to where processions of rosy globes
hung floating in the blue night The mild breeze trembled to the silver
patterings of a harp to the sweet barbaric chirping of plucked strings
of violin and celloand swooned among the maple leaves to the rhythmic
crooning of a flute And all the while from the platform came the
sounds of little cries in girlish voices and the cadenced shuffling
of young feet where the witching dancemusic had its way as ever and
forever with big and little slippers

The heart of William had behaved tumultuously the summer long whenever
his eyes beheld those pickets of the Parchers fence but now it outdid
all its previous riotings He was forced to open his mouth and gasp
for breath so deep was his draught of that young wine romance
Yondersomewhere in the breathtaking radiancedanced his Queen with
all her Court about her Queen and Court thought William and nothing
less exorbitant could have expressed his feeling For seventeen needs
only some paper lanterns a fiddle and a pretty girland Versailles is
all there

The moment was so rich that William crossed the street with a slower
step His mood changed an exaltation had come upon him though he was
never for an instant unaware of the tragedy beneath all this worldly
show and glamor It was the last night of the divine visit tomorrow
the town would lie desolate a hollow shell in the dust without her
Miss Pratt would be gonegone utterlygone away on the TRAIN But
tonight was just beginning and tonight he would dance with her he
would dance and dance with herhe would dance and dance like mad He
and she poetic and fated pair would dance on and on They would be
intoxicated by the lightsthe lights the flowers and the music Nay
the flowers might droop the lights might go out the music cease and
dawn comeshe and he would dance recklessly ononon

A sense of picturesquenesshis own picturesquenessmade him walk
rather theatrically as he passed through the groups of humble onlookers
outside the picket fence Many of these turned to stare at the belated
guest and William was unconscious of neither their low estate nor his
own quality as a patrician manabouttown in almost perfectly fitting
evening dress A faint cold smile was allowed to appear upon his lips
and a fragment from a story he had read came momentarily to his mind
Through the gaping crowds the young Augustan noble was borne down
from the Palatine scornful in his jeweled litter

An admiring murmur reached Williams ear

OH oh honey Look attem longtail suit Ats a rich boy honey

Yessum SO Bet he got his pockets pack full o twentydolluh gol
pieces right iss minute

You right honey

William allowed the coldness of his faint smile to increase to become
scornful These poor sidewalk creatures little knew what seethed inside
the alabaster of the young Augustan noble What was it to THEM that this
was Miss Pratts last night and that he intended to dance and dance with
her on and on

Almost sternly he left these squalid lives behind him and passed to the
festal gateway

Upon one of the posts of that gateway there rested the elbow of a
contemplative man middleaged or a little worse Of all persons having
pleasure or business within the bright inclosure he was that evening
the least important being merely the background parent who paid the
bills However even this unconsidered elder shared a thought in common
with the Augustan now approaching Mr Parcher had just been thinking
that there was true romance in the scene before him

But what Mr Parcher contemplated as romance arose from the fact that
these young people were dancing on a spot where their greatgrandfathers
had scalped Indians Music was made for them by descendants it might
well be of Romulus of Messalina of Benvenuto Cellini and around
behind the house waiting to serve the dancers with light food
and drink lounged and gossiped grandchildren of the Congo only
a generation or so removed from dances for which a chance stranger
furnished both the occasion and the refreshments Such in brief was
Mr Parchers peculiar view of what constituted the romantic element

And upon another subject preoccupying both Mr Parcher and William
their two views though again founded upon one thought had no real
congeniality The preoccupying subject was the imminence of Miss Pratts
departureneither Mr Parcher nor William forgot it for an instant No
matter what else played upon the surface of their attention each kept
saying to himself underneath This is the last nightthe last night
Miss Pratt is going awaygoing away tomorrow

Mr Parchers expression was peaceful It was more peaceful than it had
been for a long time In fact he wore the look of a man who had been
through the mill but now contemplated a restful and healthrestoring
vacation For there are people in this world who have no respect for the
memory of Ponce de Leon and Mr Parcher had come to be of their number
The elimination of William from his evenings had lightened the burden
nevertheless Mr Parcher would have stated freely and openly to any
responsible party that a yearning for the renewal of his youth had not
been intensified by his daughters having as a visitor all summer long
a howling belle of eighteen who talked babytalk even at breakfast and
spread her suitors all over the small houseand its one verandafrom
eight in the morning until hours of the night long after their mothers
in Mr Parchers opinion should have sent their fathers to march them
home Upon Mr Parchers optimism the effect of so much unavoidable
observation of young love had been fatal he declared repeatedly that
his faith in the human race was about gone Furthermore his physical
constitution had proved pathetically vulnerable to nightly quartets
quintets and even octets on the porch below his bedchamber window so
that he was wont to tell his wife that never never could he expect to
be again the man he had been in the spring before Miss Pratt came to
visit May And referring to conversations which he almost continuously
overheard perforce Mr Parcher said that if this was the way HE talked
at that age he would far prefer to drown in an ordinary fountain and
be dead and done with it than to bathe in Ponce de Leons

Altogether the summer had been a severe one he doubted that he could
have survived much more of it And now that it was virtually over
at last he was so resigned to the departure of his daughters lovely
little friend that he felt no regret for the splurge with which her
visit was closing Nay to speed the parting guestsuch was his lavish
moodtwice and thrice over would he have paid for the lights the
flowers the music the sandwiches the coffee the chicken salad the
cake the lemonadepunch and the icecream

Thus did the one thought divide itself between William and Mr Parcher
keeping itself deep and pure under all their other thoughts Miss Pratt
is going away thought William and Mr Parcher Miss PRATT is going
awaytomorrow

The unuttered words advanced tragically toward the gate in the head of
William at the same time that they moved contentedly away in the head
of Mr Parcher for Mr Parcher caught sight of his wife just then and
went to join her as she sank wearily upon the front steps

Taking a rest for a minute he inquired By George were both
entitled to a good LONG rest after tonight If we could afford it
wed go away to a quiet little sanitarium in the hills somewhere
and He ceased to speak and there was the renewal of an old bitterness
in his expression as his staring eyes followed the movements of a
stately young form entering the gateway Look at it said Mr Parcher
in a whisper Just look at it

Look at what asked his wife

That Baxter boy said Mr Parcher as William passed on toward the
dancers Whats he think hes imitatingHenry Irving Look at his
walk

He walks that way a good deal lately Ive noticed said Mrs Parcher
in a tired voice So do Joe Bullitt and

He didnt even come to say good evening to you Mr Parcher
interrupted Talk about MANNERS nowadays These young

He didnt see us

Well were used to that said Mr Parcher None of em see us
Theyve worn holes in all the caneseated chairs theyve scuffed up the
whole house and I havent been able to sit down anywhere downstairs
for three months without sitting on some dam boy but they dont even
know were alive Well thank the Lord its overafter tonight His
voice became reflective That Baxter boy was the worst until he took
to coming in the daytime when I was downtown I COULDNT have stood it
if hed kept on coming in the evening If Id had to listen to any more
of his talking or singing either the embalmer or the lunaticasylum
would have had me sure I see hes got hold of his daddys dresssuit
again for tonight

Is it Mr Baxters dresssuit Mrs Parcher inquired How do you
know

Mr Parcher smiled How I happen to know is a secret he said I
forgot about that His little sister Jane told me that Mrs Baxter had
hidden it or something so that Willie couldnt wear it but I guess
Jane wouldnt mind my telling YOU that she told me especially as theyre
letting him use it again tonight I suppose he feels grander n the
King o Siam

No Mrs Parcher returned thoughtfully I dont think he does just
now Her gaze was fixed upon the dancingplatform which most of
the dancers were abandoning as the music fell away to an interval
of silence In the center of the platform there remained one group
consisting of Miss Pratt and five orators and of the orators the most
impassioned and gesticulative was William

They all seem to want to dance with her all the time said Mrs
Parcher I heard her telling one of the boys half an hour ago that
all she could give him was either the twentyeighth regular dance or the
sixteenth extra

The what Mr Parcher demanded whirling to face her Do they think
this partys going to keep running till day after tomorrow And then
as his eyes returned to the group on the platform That boy seems to
have quite a touch of emotional insanity he remarked referring to
William What IS the matter with him

Oh nothing his wife returned Only trying to arrange a dance with
her He seems to be in difficulties




XXVI

MISS BOKE

Nothing could have been more evident than Williams difficulties They
continued to exist with equal obviousness when the group broke up in
some confusion after a few minutes of animated discussion Mr Wallace
Banks that busy and executive youth bearing Miss Pratt triumphantly
off to the lemonadepunchbowl while William pursued Johnnie Watson
and Joe Bullitt He sought to detain them near the edge of the platform
though they appeared far from anxious to linger in his company and he
was able to arrest their attention only by clutching an arm of each In
fact the good feeling which had latterly prevailed among these three
appeared to be in danger of disintegrating The occasion was too
vital and the watchword for Miss Pratts last night was
DevilTaketheHindmost

Now you look here Johnnie William said vehemently and you listen
too Joe You both got seven dances apiece with her anyway all on
account of my not getting here early enough and you got to

It wasnt because of any such reason young Mr Watson protested I
asked her for mine two days ago

Well THAT wasnt fair was it William cried Just because I never
thought of sneaking in ahead like that you go and

Well you ought to thought of it Johnnie retorted jerking his arm
free of Williams grasp I cant stand here GABBIN all night And he
hurried away

Joe William began fastening more securely upon Mr BullittJoe
Ive done a good many favors for you and

Ive got to see a man Mr Bullitt interrupted Lemme go Silly Bill
Theres some body I got to see right away before the next dance begins
I GOT to Honest I have

William seized him passionately by the lapels of his coat Listen Joe
For goodness sake cant you listen a MINUTE You GOT to give me

Honest Bill his friend expostulated backing away as forcefully as
possible I got to find a fellow thats here tonight and ask him about
something important before

Ye gods Cant you wait a MINUTE William cried keeping his grip upon
Joes lapels You GOT to give me anyway TWO out of all your dances with
her You heard her tell me yourself that shed be willing if you or
Johnnie or

Well I only got five or six with her and a couple extras Johnnies
got seven Whynt you go after Johnnie I bet hed help you out all
right if you kept after him What you want to pester ME for Bill

The brutal selfishness of this speech as well as its coldblooded
insincerity produced in William the impulse to smite Fortunately his
only hope lay in persuasion and after a momentary struggle with his own
features he was able to conceal what he desired to do to Joes

He swallowed and increasing the affectionate desperation of his clutch
upon Mr Bullitts lapels Joe he began huskilyJoe if _I_d got
six reglar and two extras with Miss Pratt her last night here and you
got here late and it wasnt your faultI couldnt help being late
could I It wasnt my fault I was late I guess was it Well if I
was in YOUR place I wouldnt act the way you and Johnnie donot in a
thousand years I wouldnt Id say You want a couple o my dances with
Miss Pratt ole man Why CERTAINLY

Yes you would was the cynical comment of Mr Bullitt whose averted
face and reluctant shoulders indicated a strong desire to conclude the
interview Tonight especially he added

Look here Joe said William desperately dont you realize that
this is the very last night Miss Pratts going to be in this town

You bet I do These words though vehement were inaudible being
formed in the mind of Mr Bullitt but for diplomatic reasons not
projected upon the air by his vocal organs

William continued Joe you and I have been friends ever since you and
I were boys He spoke with emotion but Joe had no appearance of being
favorably impressed And when I look back said William I expect
Ive done more favors for you than I ever have for any oth

But Mr Bullitt briskly interrupted this appealing reminiscence
Listen here Silly Bill he said becoming all at once friendly and
encouragingBill theres other girls here you can get dances with
Theres one or two of em sittin around in the yard You can have a
bully time even if you did come late And with the air of discharging
happily all the obligations of which William had reminded him he added
Ill tell you THAT much Bill

Joe you got to give me anyway ONE da

Look said Mr Bullitt eagerly Look sittin yonder over under
that tree all by herself Thats a visiting girl named Miss Boke shes
visiting some old uncle or something shes got livin here and I bet
you could

Joe you GOT to

I bet that Miss Bokes a good dancer Bill Joe continued warmly
May Parcher says so She was tryin to get me to dance with her myself
but I couldnt or I would of Honest Bill I would of Bill if I was
you Id sail right in there before anybody else got a start and Id

Ole man said William gently you remember the time Miss Pratt and I
had an engagement to go walkin and you wouldnt of seen her for a week
on account of your aunt dyin in Kansas City if I hadnt let you go
along with us Ole man if you

But the music sounded for the next dance and Joe felt that it was
indeed time to end this uncomfortable conversation I got to go Bill
he said I GOT to

Wait just one minute William implored I want to say just this
if

Here exclaimed Mr Bullitt I got to GO

I know it Thats why

Heedless of remonstrance Joe wrenched himself free for it would have
taken a powerful and ruthless man to detain him longer What you take
me for he demanded indignantly I got this with Miss PRATT

And evading a hand which still sought to clutch him he departed hotly

 Mr Parchers voice expressed wonder a little later as he
recommended his wife to turn her gaze in the direction of that Baxter
boy again Just look at him said Mr Parcher His face has got more
genuine idiocy in it than Ive seen around here yet and God knows Ive
been seeing some miracles in that line this summer

Hes looking at Lola Pratt said Mrs Parcher

Dont you suppose I can see that Mr Parcher returned with some
irritation Thats whats the trouble with him Why dont he QUIT
looking at her

I think probably he feels badly because shes dancing with one of the
other boys said his wife mildly

Then why cant he dance with somebody else himself Mr Parcher
inquired testily Instead of standing around like a calf looking out
of the butchers wagon By George he looks as if he was just going to
MOO

Of course he ought to be dancing with somebody Mrs Parcher remarked
thoughtfully There are one or two more girls than boys here and
hes the only boy not dancing I believe Ill And not stopping to
complete the sentence she rose and walked across the interval of grass
to William Good evening William she said pleasantly Dont you
want to dance

Maam said William blankly and the eyes he turned upon here were
glassy with anxiety He was still determined to dance on and on and on
with Miss Pratt but he realized that there were great obstacles to be
overcome before he could begin the process He was feverishly awaiting
the next interregnum between dancesthen he would show Joe Bullitt and
Johnnie Watson and Wallace Banks and some others who had set themselves
in his way that he was abslutely not goin to stand it

He couldnt stand it he told himself even if he wanted tonot
tonight He had been through enough in order to get to the party he
thought thus defining sufferings connected with his costume and now
that he was here he WOULD dance and dance on and on with Miss Pratt
Anything else was unthinkable

He HAD to

Dont you want to dance Mrs Parcher repeated Have you looked
around for a girl without a partner

He continued to stare at her plainly having no comprehension of her
meaning

Girl he echoed in a tone of feeble inquiry

She smiled and nodded taking his arm You come with me she said
ILL fix you up

William suffered her to conduct him across the yard Intensely
preoccupied with what he meant to do as soon as the music paused he
was somewhat hazy but when he perceived that he was being led in the
direction of a girl sitting solitary under one of the mapletrees the
sudden shock of fear aroused his faculties

Whatwhere he stammered halting and seeking to detach himself from
his hostess

What is it she asked

I gotI got to William began uneasily I got to

His purpose was to excuse himself on the ground that he had to find a
man and tell him something important before the next dance for in the
confusion of the moment his powers refused him greater originality
But the vital part of his intended excuse remained unspoken being
disregarded and cut short as millions of other masculine diplomacies
have been throughout the centuries by the decisive action of ladies

Miss Boke had been sitting under the mapletree for a long timeso long
indeed that she was acquiring a profound distaste for forestry and even
for maple syrup In fact her state of mind was as desperate in its
way as Williams and when a hostess leads a youth in almost perfectly
fitting conventional black toward a girl who has been sitting alone
through dance after dance that girl knows what that youth is going to
have to do

It must be confessed for Miss Boke that her eyes had been upon William
from the moment Mrs Parcher addressed him Nevertheless as the pair
came toward her she looked casually away in an indifferent manner And
yet this may have been but a seeming unconsciousness for upon the very
instant of Williams halting and before he had managed to stammer I
got to for the fourth time Miss Boke sprang to her feet and met Mrs
Parcher more than halfway

Oh Mrs Parcher she called coming forward

I got the panicstricken William again hastily began I got to

Oh Mrs Parcher cried Miss Boke Ive been SO worried Theres a
candle in that Japanese lantern just over your head and I think its
going out

Ill run and get a fresh one in a minute said Mrs Parcher smiling
benevolently and retaining Williams arm with a little difficulty We
were just coming to find you Ive brought

I got toI got to find a m William made a last stricken effort

Miss Boke this is Mr Baxter said Mrs Parcher and she added with
what seemed to William hideous garrulity He and you both came late
dear and he hasnt any dances engaged either So run and dance and
have a nice time together

Thereupon this disastrous woman returned to her husband Her look was
conscientious she thought she had done something pleasant

The full horror of his position was revealed to William in the relieved
confident proprietors smile of Miss Boke For William lived by a code
from which no previous experience had taught him any means of escape
Mrs Parcher had made the statementso needless and so ruinousthat
he had no engagements and in his dismay he had been unable to deny this
fatal truth he had been obliged to let it stand Henceforth he was
committed absolutely to Miss Boke until either some one else asked her
to dance or while yet in her close company William could obtain an
engagement with another girl The latter alternative presented certain
grave difficulties also contracting William to dance with the other
girl before once more obtaining his freedom but undeniably he regarded
it from the first as the more hopeful

He had to give form to the fatal invitation Mav this dance thyou
he muttered doggedly

Vurry pleased to Miss Boke responded whereupon they walked in
silence to the platform stepped upon its surface and embraced

They made a false start

They made another

They stood swaying to catch the time then made another After that they
tried again and were saved from a fall only by spasmodic and noticeable
contortions

Miss Boke laughed tolerantly as if forgiving William for his
awkwardness and his hot heart grew hotter with that injustice She was
a large ample girl weighing more than William this must be definitely
claimed in his behalf and she had been spending the summer at a
lakeside hotel where she had constantly danced mans part To paint
Williams predicament at a stroke his partner was a determined rather
than a graceful dancerand their efforts to attune themselves to each
other and to the music were in a fair way to attract general attention

A coarse chuckle a halfsuppressed snort assailed Williams scarlet
ear and from the corner of his eye he caught a glimpse of Joe Bullitt
gliding by suffused while over Joes detested shoulder could be seen
the adorable and piquant face of the One girlalso suffused

Doggone it William panted

Oh you mustnt be discouraged with yourself said Miss Boke
genially Ive met lots of Men that had trouble to get started and
turned out to be right good dancers after all It seems to me were
kind of workin against each other Ill tell youyou kind of let me
do the guiding and Ill get you going fine Now ONE two ONE two
There

William ceased to struggle for dominance and their efforts to get
started were at once successful With a muscular power that was
surprising Miss Boke bore him out into the circling current swung
him round and round walked him backward half across the platform then
swung him round and round and round again For a girl she guided
remarkably well nevertheless a series of collisions varying in
intensity marked the path of the pair upon the rather crowded platform
In such emergencies Miss Boke proved herself deft in swinging William
to act as a buffer and he several times found himself heavily stricken
from the rear anon his face would be pressed suffocatingly into Miss
Bokes hair without the slightest wish on his part for such intimacy
He had a helpless feeling fully warranted by the circumstances Also
he soon became aware that Miss Bokes powerful guiding was observed
by the public for after one collision more severe than others a low
voice hissed in his ear

SHE WONT HURT YOU MUCH SILLY BILL SHES ONLY IN FUN

This voice belonged to the dancer with whom he had just been in painful
contact Johnnie Watson However Johnnie had whirled far upon another
orbit before William found a retort and then it was a feeble one

I wish YOUD try a few dances with her he whispered inaudibly but
with unprecedented bitterness as the masterly arm of his partner just
saved him from going over the edge of the platform I bet shed kill
you

More than once he tried to assert himself and resume his natural place
as guide but each time he did so he immediately got out of step with
his partner their knees collided embarrassingly they staggered and
walked upon each others instepsand William was forced to abandon the
unequal contest

I just love dancing said Miss Boke serenely Dont you Mr
Baxter

What he gulped Yeh

Its a beautiful floor for dancing isnt it

Yeh

I just love dancing Miss Boke thought proper to declare again Dont
you love it Mr Baxter

This time he considered his enthusiasm to be sufficiently indicated by a
nod He needed all his breath

Its lovely she murmured I hope they dont play Home Sweet
Home very early at parties in this town I could keep on like this all
night

To the gasping William it seemed that she already had kept on like this
all night and he expressed himself in one great frank agonized moan
of relief when the music stopped I sh think those musicians d be
dead he said as he wiped his brow And then discovering that May
Parcher stood at his elbow he spoke hastily to her Mav the next
thyou

But Miss Parcher had begun to applaud the musicians for an encore She
shook her head Nexts the third extra she said And anyhow this
ones going to be encored now You can have the twentysecondif there
IS any William threw a wild glance about him looking for other girls
but the tireless orchestra began to play the encore and Miss Boke who
had been applauding instantly cast herself upon his bosom Come on
she cried Dont lets miss a second of it Its just glorious

When the encore was finished she seized Williams arm and mentioning
that shed left her fan upon the chair under the mapletree added
Come on Lets go get it QUICK

Under the mapletree she fanned herself and talked of her love for
dancing until the music sounded again Come on she cried then
Dont lets miss a second of it Its just glorious

And grasping his arm she propelled him toward the platform with a merry
little rush

So passed five dances Long long dances

Likewise five encores Long encores




XXVII

MAROONED

At every possible opportunity William hailed other girls with a hasty
Mav the next thyou but he was indeed unfortunate to have arrived so
late

The best he got was a promise of the nineteenthif there IS any

After each dance Miss Boke conducted him back to the mapletree aloof
from the general throng and William found the intermissions almost
equal to his martyrdoms upon the platform But as there was a barely
perceptible balance in their favor he collected some fragments of his
broken spirit when Miss Boke would have borne him to the platform for
the sixth time and begged to sit this one out alleging that he had
kind of turned his ankle or something he believed

The cordial girl at once placed him upon the chair and gallantly
procured another for herself In her solicitude she sat close to him
looking fondly at his face while William though now and then rubbing
his ankle for plausibilitys sake gazed at the platform with an
expression which Gustave Dore would gratefully have found suggestive
William was conscious of a voice continually in action near him but
not of what it said Miss Boke was telling him of the dancing up at the
lake where she had spent the summer and how much she had loved it but
William missed all that Upon the manycolored platform the ineffable
One drifted to and fro back and forth her little blonde head in a
golden net glinting here and there like a bit of tinsel blowing across
a flowergarden

And when that dance and its encore were over she went to lean against a
tree while Wallace Banks fanned her but she was so busy with Wallace
that she did not notice William though she passed near enough to waft a
breath of violet scent to his wan nose A fragment of her silver speech
tinkled in his ear

Oh Wallie Banks Bid pid sant have Bruvva JosieJoes dance less Joe
say so Lola MUS be fair Wallie mustnt

Thats that Miss Pratt observed Miss Boke following Williams gaze
with some interest You met her yet

Yeh said William

Shes been visiting here all summer Miss Boke informed him I was at
a little tea this afternoon and some of the girls said this Miss Pratt
said shed never DREAM of getting engaged to any man that didnt have
seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars I dont know if its true or
not but I expect so Anyway they said they heard her say so

William lifted his right hand from his ankle and passed it time after
time across his damp forehead He did not believe that Miss Pratt could
have expressed herself in so mercenary a manner but if she HADwell
one fact in British history had so impressed him that he remembered
it even after Examination William Pitt the younger had been Prime
Minister of England at twentyone

If an Englishman could do a thing like that surely a bright energetic
young American neednt feel worried about seven hundred and fifty
thousand dollars And although William at seventeen had seldom
possessed more than seven hundred and fifty cents four long years must
pass and much could be done before he would reach the age at which
William Pitt attained the premiershipcoincidentally a good ripe
marriageable age Still seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is
a stiffish order even allowing four long years to fill it and
undoubtedly Miss Bokes bit of gossip added somewhat to the already
sufficient anxieties of Williams evening

Up at the lake Miss Boke chattered on we got to use the hotel
diningroom for the hops Its a floor a good deal like this floor is
tonightjust about oily enough and as nice a floor as ever I danced
on We have awfly good times up at the lake Course there arent so
many Men up there like there are here tonight and I MUST say I AM
glad to get a chance to dance with a Man again I told you youd dance
all right once we got started and look at the way its turned out
our steps just suit exactly If I must say it I could scarcely think of
anybody I EVER met Id rather dance with When anybodys step suits in
with mine that way why I LOVE to dance straight through an evening
with one person the way were doing

Dimly yet with strong repulsion William perceived that their
interminable companionship had begun to affect Miss Boke with a liking
for him And as she chattered chummily on revealing this increasing
cordiality all the whilethough her more obvious topics were dancing
dancingfloors and the lakethe reciprocal sentiment roused in his
breast was that of Sindbad the Sailor for the Old Man of the Sea

He was unable to foresee a future apart from her and when she informed
him that she preferred his style of dancing to all other styles shown
by the Men at this party her thus singling him out for praise only
emphasized in his mind that point upon which he was the most
embittered

Yes he reflected It had to be ME With all the crowd to choose
from Mrs Parcher had to go and pick on HIM All all the others went
about free as air flitting from girl to girlgirls that danced like
girls All all except William danced with Miss PRATT What Miss Pratt
had offered HIM was a choice between the thirtysecond dance and
the twentyfirst extra THAT was what he had to look forward to the
thirtysecond reglar or the twentyfirst extra

Meanwhile merely through eternity he was sealed unto Miss Boke

The tie that bound them oppressed him as if it had been an illomened
matrimony and he sat beside her like an unwilling old husband All the
while Miss Boke had no appreciation whatever of her companions real
condition and when little spasmodic sinister changes appeared in his
face as they certainly did from time to time she attributed them to
pains in his ankle However William decided to discard his ankle
after they had sat out two dances on account of it He decided that he
preferred dancing and said he guessed he must be better

So they danced againand again

When the fourteenth dance came about half an hour before midnight they
were still dancing together

It was upon the conclusion of this fourteenth dance that Mr Parcher
mentioned to his wife a change in his feelings toward William Ive
been watching him said Mr Parcher and I never saw true misery show
plainer Hes having a really horrible time By George I hate him but
Ive begun to feel kind of sorry for him Cant you trot up somebody
else so he can get away from that fat girl

Mrs Parcher shook her head in a discouraged way Ive tried and Ive
tried and Ive tried she said

Well try again

I cant now She waved her hand toward the rear of the house Round
the corner marched a short procession of negroes bearing trays and
the dancers were dispersing themselves to chairs upon the lawn for
refreshments

Well do something Mr Parcher urged We dont want to find him in
the cistern in the morning

Mrs Parcher looked thoughtful then brightened _I_ know she said
Ill make May and Lola and their partners come sit in this little
circle of chairs here and then Ill go and bring Willie and Miss Boke
to sit with them Ill give Willie the seat at Lolas left You keep the
chairs

Straightway she sped upon her kindly errand It proved successful so
successful indeed that without the slightest effortwithout even a
hint on her partshe brought not only William and his constant friend
to sit in the circle with Miss Pratt Miss Parcher and their escorts
but Mr Bullitt Mr Watson Mr Banks and three other young gentlemen
as well Nevertheless Mrs Parcher managed to carry out her plan
and after a little display of firmness saw William satisfactorily
established in the chair at Miss Pratts left

At last at last he sat beside the fairylike creature and filled
his lungs with infinitesimal particles of violet scent More he was no
sooner seated than the little blonde head bent close to his the golden
net brushed his cheek She whispered

Noty ickle boy Batster Lolas last night an ickle boy Batster
fluttin Flut all night wif dray bid dirl

William made no reply

There are occasions infrequent of course when even a bachelor is not
flattered by being accused of flirting Williams feelings toward Miss
Boke had by this time come to such a pass that he regarded the charge
of flirting with her as little less than an implication of grave
mental deficiency And well he remembered how Miss Pratt beholding his
subjugated gymnastics in the dance had grown pink with laughter But
still the roseleaf lips whispered

Lola saw Lola saw bad boy Batster under dray bid tree fluttin wif
dray bid dirl Fluttin all night wif dray bid normous dirl

Her cruelty was all unwitting she intended to rally him sweetly But
seventeen is deathly serious at such junctures and William was in a
sensitive condition He made no reply in words Instead he drew himself
up from the waist that is because he was sitting with a kind of
proud dignity And that was all

Oo tross whispered Lola

He spake not

Twasnt my fault about dancing she said Bad boy What made you
come so late

He maintained his silence and the accompanying icy dignity whereupon
she made a charming little pout

Oo be so tross she said Lola talk to nice Man uvver side of her

With that she turned her back upon him and prattled merrily to the
gentleman of sixteen upon her right

Still and cold sat William Let her talk to the Man at the other side
of her as she would and never so gaily William knew that she was
conscious every instant of the reproachful presence upon her left And
somehow these moments of quiet and melancholy dignity became the most
satisfactory he had known that evening For as he sat so silent so
austere and not yet eating though a plate of chicken salad had been
placed upon his lap he began to feel that there was somewhere about
him a mysterious superiority which set him apart from other peopleand
above them This quality indefinable and lofty had carried him through
troubles that very night which would have wrecked the lives of such
simple fellows as Joe Bullitt and Johnnie Watson And although Miss
Pratt continued to make merry with the Man upon her right it seemed
to William that this was but outward show He had a strange subtle
impression that the mysterious superiority which set him apart from
others was becoming perceptible to herthat she was feeling it too

Alas Such are the moments Fate seizes upon to play the clown

Over the chatter and laughter of the guests rose a too familiar voice
Lemme hep you to nice tongue samwich lady Nom Nice green lettuce
samwich lady

Genesis

Nice tongue samwich suh Nice lettuce samwich lady he could be
heard vociferatingperhaps a little too much as if he had sandwiches
for sale Lemme jes lay this nice green lettuce samwich on you plate
fer you

His widespread hand bore the tray of sandwiches high overhead for his
style in waiting was florid though polished He walked with a faint
shuffling suggestion of a prance a lissome pomposity adopted in
obedience to the artsense within him which bade him harmonize himself
with occasions of state and fashion His manner was the supersupreme
expression of graciousness but the graciousness was innocent being but
an affectation and nothing inwardfor inwardly Genesis was humble He
was only pretending to be the kind of waiter he would like to be

And because he was a new waiter he strongly wished to show familiarity
with his dutiesfamiliarity in fact with everything and everybody
This yearning born of selfdoubt and intensified by a slight touch of
gin was beyond question the inspiration of his painful behavior when
he came near the circle of chairs where sat Mr and Mrs Parcher Miss
Parcher Miss Pratt Miss Boke Mr Watson Mr Bullitt othersand
William

Nice tongue samwich lady he announced semicakewalking beneath his
highborne tray

Nice green lettuce sam He came suddenly to a dramatic deadstop as he
beheld William sitting before him wearing that strange new dignity and
Mr Baxters evening clothes Name o gooness Genesis exclaimed so
loudly that every one looked up How in the livin worl you evuh come
to git here You daddy sutny mus a weakened way down fo he let
you wear his lowcut ves an pants an longtail coat I bet any man
fifty cents you gone an stole em out aftuh he done went to bed

And he burst into a wild free African laugh

At seventeen such things are not embarrassing they are catastrophical
But mercifully catastrophes often produce a numbness in the victims
More as in a trance than actually William heard the outbreak of his
young companions and during the quarter of an hour subsequent to
Genesiss performance the oftrenewed explosions of their mirth made
but a kind of horrid buzzing in his ears Like sounds borne from far
away were the gaspings of Mr and Mrs Parcher striving with all their
strength to obtain mastery of themselves once more

 A flourish of music challenged the dancers Couples appeared upon
the platform

The dreadful supper was over

The ineffable One supremely pink rose from her seat at Williams
side and moved toward the platform with the glowing Joe Bullitt Then
William roused to action by this sight sprang to his feet and took a
step toward them But it was only one weak step

A warm and ample hand placed itself firmly inside the crook of his
elbow Lets get started for this one before the floor gets all crowded
up said Miss Boke

Miss Boke danced and danced with him she danced him onand onand
on

At half past one the orchestra played Home Sweet Home As the last
bars sounded a group of earnest young men who had surrounded the lovely
guest of honor talking vehemently broke into loud shouts embraced one
another and capered variously over the lawn Mr Parcher beheld from a
distance these manifestations and then with an astonishment even more
profound took note of the tragic William who was running toward him
radiantMiss Boke hovering futilely in the far background

Whats all the hullabaloo Mr Parcher inquired

Miss Pratt gasped William Miss Pratt

Well what about her

And upon receiving Williams reply Mr Parcher might well have
discerned behind it the invisible hand of an ironic but recompensing
Providence making things eventaking from the one to give to the other

Shes going to stay shouted the happy William Shes promised to
stay another week

And then mingling with the sounds of rejoicing there ascended to
heaven the stricken cry of an elderly man plunging blindly into the
house in search of his wife




XXVIII

RANNIE KIRSTED

Observing the monotonously proper behavior of the sun man had an absurd
idea and invented Time Becoming still more absurd man said So much
shall be a day such and such shall be a week All weeks shall be the
same length Yet every baby knows better How long for Johnnie Watson
for Joe Bullitt for Wallace Bankshow long for William Sylvanus Baxter
was the last week of Miss Pratt No one can answer How long was that
week for Mr Parcher Again the mind is staggered

Many people of course considered it to be a week of average size
Among these was Jane

Throughout seven days which brought some tense moments to the Baxter
household Jane remained calm and she was still calm upon the eighth
morning as she stood in the front yard of her own place of residence
gazing steadily across the street The object of her grave attention was
an ample brick house newly painted white after repairs and enlargements
so inspiring to Janes faculty for suggesting better ways of doing
things that the workmen had learned to address her with a slight
bitterness as Madam President

Throughout the process of repair and until the very last of the
painting Jane had considered this house to be as much her property as
anybodys for children regard as ownerless all vacant houses and all
houses in course of construction or radical alteration Nothing short of
furnitureintimate furniture in considerable quantityhints that the
public is not expected However such a hint or warning was conveyed
to Jane this morning for two express wagons were standing at the curb
with their backs impolitely toward the brick house and powerfulvoiced
men went surging to and fro under fat armchairs mahogany tables
disarticulated bedsteads and baskets of china and glassware while a
harassed lady appeared in the outer doorway from time to time with
gestures of lamentation and entreaty Upon the sidewalk between the
wagons and the gate was a broad wet spot vaguely circular with a
partial circumference of broken glass and extinct goldfish

Jane was forced to conclude that the brick house did belong to somebody
after all Wherefore she remained in her own yard a steadfast
spectator taking nourishment into her system at regular intervals
This was beautifully automatic in each hand she held a slice of bread
freely plastered over with butter apple sauce and powdered sugar
and when she had taken somewhat from the right hand that hand slowly
descended with its burden while simultaneously the left began to
rise reaching the level of her mouth precisely at the moment when a
little wave passed down her neck indicating that the route was clear
Then having made delivery the left hand sank while the right began to
rise again And so well had custom trained Janes members never once
did she glance toward either of these faithful hands or the food that
it supported her gaze was all the while free to remain upon the house
across the way and the great doings before it

After a while something made her wide eyes grow wider almost to their
utmost Nay the event was of that importance her mechanical hands
ceased to move and stopped stockstill the right halfway up the left
halfway down as if because of sudden motor trouble within Jane Her
mouth was equally affected remaining open at a visible crisis in the
performance of its duty These were the tokens of her agitation upon
beholding the removal of a dolls house from one of the wagons This
dolls house was at least five feet high of proportionate breadth and
depths the customary absence of a facade disclosing an interior of four
luxurious floors with stairways fireplaces and wallpaper Here was a
mansion wherein dollduchesses no less must dwell

Straightway a little girl ran out of the open doorway of the brick
house and with a selfimportance concentrated to the point of
shrewishness began to give orders concerning the disposal of her
personal property which included as she made clear not only the
dolls mansion but also three dolls trunks and a packingcase of fair
size She was a thin little girl perhaps half a year younger than Jane
and she was as soiled particularly in respect to hands brow chin and
the knees of white stockings as could be expected of any busybodyish
person of nine or ten whose mother is housemoving But she was
giftedif we choose to put the matter in the hopeful sweeter wayshe
was gifted with an unusually loud and shrill voice and she made herself
heard over the strongvoiced men to such emphatic effect that one of the
latter with the dolls mansion upon his back paused in the gateway to
acquaint her with his opinion that of all the bossy little girls he had
ever seen heard or heard of she was the bossiest

THE worst he added

The little girl across the street was of course instantly aware of Jane
though she pretended not to be and from the first her selfimportance
was in large part assumed for the benefit of the observer After a
momentary silence due to her failure to think of any proper response to
the workman who so pointedly criticized her she resumed the peremptory
direction of her affairs She ran in and out of the house her brow dark
with frowns her shoulders elevated and by every means at her disposal
she urged her audience to behold the frightful responsibilities of one
who must keep a thousand things in her head at once and yet be ready
for decisive action at any instant

There may have been one weakness in this strong performance the
artistic sincerity of it was a little discredited by the increasing
frequency with which the artist took note of her effect During each
of her most impressive moments she flashed from the far corner of her
eye two questions at Jane How about THAT one Are you still watching
Me

Then apparently in the very midst of her cares she suddenly and
without warning ceased to boss walked out into the street halted and
stared frankly at Jane

Jane had begun her automatic feeding again She continued it meanwhile
seriously returning the stare of the new neighbor For several minutes
this mutual calm and inoffensive gaze was protracted then Jane after
swallowing the last morsel of her supplies turned her head away and
looked at a tree The little girl into whose eyes some wistfulness had
crept also turned her head and looked at a tree After a while she
advanced to the curb on Janes side of the street and swinging her
right foot allowed it to kick the curbstone repeatedly

Jane came out to the sidewalk and began to kick one of the
fencepickets

You see that ole fatty asked the little girl pointing to one of the
workmen thus sufficiently identified

Yes

Thats the one broke the goldfish said the little girl There was a
pause during which she continued to scuff the curbstone with her shoe
Jane likewise scuffing the fencepicket Im goin to have papa get him
arrested added the stranger

My papa got two men arrested once Jane said calmly Two or three

The little girls eyes wandering upward took note of Janes papas
house and of a fierce young gentleman framed in an open window
upstairs He was seated wore ink upon his forehead and tapped his
teeth with a red penholder

Who is that she asked

Its Willie

Is it your papa

NOOOO Jane exclaimed Its WILLIE

Oh said the little girl apparently satisfied

Each now scuffed less energetically with her shoe feet slowed down
so did conversation and for a time Jane and the stranger wrapped
themselves in stillness though there may have been some silent
communing between them Then the new neighbor placed her feet far apart
and leaned backward upon nothing curving her front outward and her
remarkably flexible spine inward until a profile view of her was grandly
semicircular

Jane watched her attentively but without comment However no one
could have doubted that the processes of acquaintance were progressing
favorably

Lets go in our yard said Jane

The little girl straightened herself with a slight gasp and accepted
the invitation Side by side the two passed through the open gate
walked gravely forth upon the lawn and halted as by common consent
Jane thereupon placed her feet wide apart and leaned backward upon
nothing attempting the feat in contortion just performed by the
stranger

Look she said Look at ME

But she lacked the others genius lost her balance and fell Born
persistent she immediately got to her feet and made fresh efforts

No Look at ME the little girl cried becoming semicircular again
This is the way I call it puttin your stummick out o joint You
havent got yours out far enough

Yes I have said Jane gasping

Well to do it right you must WALK that way As soon as you get your
stummick out o joint you must begin an walk Look Like this And
the little girl having achieved a state of such convexity that her
braided hair almost touched the ground behind her walked successfully
in that singular attitude

Im walkin Jane protested her face not quite upside down Look
IM walkin that way too My stummick

There came an outraged shout from above and a fierce countenance
stained with ink protruded from the window

Jane

What

Stop that Stop putting your stomach out in front of you like that
Its disgraceful

Both young ladies looking rather oppressed resumed the perpendicular
Why doesnt he like it the stranger asked in a tone of pure wonder

I dont know said Jane He doesnt like much of anything Hes
seventeen years old

After that the two stared moodily at the ground for a little while
chastened by the severe presence above then Jane brightened

_I_ know she exclaimed cozily Lets play callers Right here by
this bush ll be my house You come to call on me an well talk
about our chuldren You be Mrs Smith an Im Mrs Jones And in the
character of a hospitable matron she advanced graciously toward the new
neighbor Why my dear Mrs SMITH come right IN I THOUGHT youd call
this morning I want to tell you about my lovely little daughter Shes
only ten years old an says the brightest THINGS You really must

But here Jane interrupted herself abruptly and hopping behind the
residential bush peeped over it not at Mrs Smith but at a boy of ten
or eleven who was passing along the sidewalk Her expression was gravely
interested somewhat complacent and Mrs Smith was not so lacking in
perception that she failed to understand how completelyfor the time
being at leastcalling was suspended

The boy whistled briskly My country tis of thee and though his
knowledge of the air failed him when he finished the second line he
was not disheartened but began at the beginning again continuing
repeatedly after this fashion to offset monotony by patriotism He
whistled loudly he walked with ostentatious intent to be at some heavy
affair in the distance his ears were red He looked neither to the
right nor to the left

That is he looked neither to the right nor to the left until he had
passed the Baxters fence But when he had gone as far as the upper
corner of the fence beyond he turned his head and looked back without
any expressionexcept that of a whistlerat Jane And thus still
whistling My country tis of thee and with blank pink face over his
shoulder he proceeded until he was out of sight

Who was that boy the new neighbor then inquired

Its Freddie said Jane placidly Hes in our Sundayschool Hes in
love of me

JANE

Again the outraged and inkstained countenance glared down from the
window

What you want Jane asked

What you MEAN talking about such things William demanded In all my
life I never heard anything as disgusting Shame on you

The little girl from across the street looked upward thoughtfully Hes
mad she remarked and regardless of Janes previous information It
IS your papa isnt it she insisted

No said Jane testily I told you five times its my brother
Willie

Oh said the little girl and grasping the fact that Williams
position was in dignity and authority negligible compared with that
which she had persisted in imagining she felt it safe to tint her
upward gaze with disfavor He acts kind of crazy she murmured

Hes in love of Miss Pratt said Jane Shes goin away today She
said shed go before but today she IS Mr Parcher where she visits
hes almost dead shes stayed so long Shes awful I think

William to whom all was audible shouted hoarsely Ill see to YOU
and disappeared from the window

Will he come down here the little girl asked taking a step toward
the gate

No Hes just gone to call mamma All shell do ll be to tell us to go
play somewheres else Then we can go talk to Genesis

Who

Genesis Hes puttin a load of coal in the cellar window with a
shovel Hes nice

Whats he put the coal in the window for

Hes a colored man said Jane

Shall we go talk to him now

No Jane said thoughtfully Lets be playin callers when mamma
comes to tell us to go way What was your name

Rannie

No it wasnt

It is too Rannie the little girl insisted My whole names Mary
Randolph Kirsted but my short names Rannie

Jane laughed What a funny name she said I didnt mean your real
name I meant your callers name One of us was Mrs Jones and one
was

I want to be Mrs Jones said Rannie

Oh my DEAR Mrs Jones Jane began at once I want to tell you
about my lovely chuldren I have two one only seven years old and the
other

Jane called Mrs Baxter from Williams window

Yesm

You must go somewhere else to play Willies trying to work at his
studies up here and he says youve disturbed him very much

Yesm

The obedient Jane and her friend turned to go and as they went Miss
Mary Randolph Kirsted allowed her uplifted eyes to linger with increased
disfavor upon William who appeared beside Mrs Baxter at the window

I tell you what lets do Rannie suggested in a lowered voice He got
so fresh with us an made your mother come an all letslets

She hesitated

Lets what Jane urged her in an eager whisper

Lets think up somepn he wont likean DO it

They disappeared round a corner of the house their heads close
together




XXIX

DONT FORGET

Upstairs Mrs Baxter moved to the door of her sons room pretending
to be unconscious of the gaze he maintained upon her Mustering courage
to hum a little tune and affecting inconsequence she had nearly crossed
the threshold when he said sternly

And this is all you intend to say to that child

Why yes Willie

And yet I told you what she said he cried I told you I HEARD her
stand there and tell that dirtyfaced little girl how that idiot boy
thats always walkin past here four or five times a day whistling and
looking back was in love of her Ye gods What kind of a person will
she grow up into if you dont punish her for havin ideas like that at
her age

Mrs Baxter regarded him mildly not replying and he went on with loud
indignation

I never heard of such a thing That Worm walkin past here four or five
times a day just to look at JANE And her standing there calmly tellin
that sootyfaced little girl Hes in love of me Why its enough to
sicken a man Honestly if I had my way Id see that both she and that
little Freddie Banks got a firstclass whipping

Dont you think Willie said Mrs Baxterdont you think that
considering the rather noncommittal method of Freddies courtship you
are suggesting extreme measures

Well SHE certainly ought to be punished he insisted and then with
a reversal to agony he shuddered Thats the least of it he cried
Its the insulting things you always allow her to say of one of the
noblest girls in the United StatesTHATS what counts On the very last
dayyes almost the last hourthat Miss Pratts in this town you let
your only daughter stand there and speak disrespectfully of herand
then all you do is tell her to go and play somewhere else I dont
understand your way of bringing up a child he declared passionately
I do NOT

There there Willie Mrs Baxter said Youre all wrought up

I am NOT wrought up shouted William Why should I be charged with

Now now she said Youll feel better tomorrow

What do you mean by that he demanded breathing deeply

For reply she only shook her head in an odd little way and in her
parting look at him there was something at once compassionate amused
and reassuring

Youll be all right Willie she said softly and closed the door

Alone William lifted clenched hands in a series of tumultuous
gestures at the ceiling then he moaned and sank into a chair at his
writingtable Presently a comparative calm was restored to him and
with reverent fingers he took from a drawer a onepound box of candy
covered with white tissuepaper girdled with blue ribbon He set the
box gently beside him upon the table then from beneath a large green
blotter drew forth some scribbled sheets These he placed before him
and taking infinite pains with his handwriting slowly copied


DEAR LOLAI presume when you are reading these lines it will be this
afternoon and you will be on the train moving rapidly away from this old
place here farther and farther from it all As I sit here at my old desk
and look back upon it all while I am writing this farewell letter I hope
when you are reading it you also will look back upon it all and think
of one you called Alias Little Boy Baxter As I sit here this morning
that you are going away at last I look back and I cannot rember any
summer in my whole life which has been like this summer because a great
change has come over me this summer If you would like to know what this
means it was something like I said when John Watson got there yesterday
afternoon and interrupted what I said May you enjoy this candy and think
of the giver I will put something in with this letter It is something
maybe you would like to have and in exchange I would give all I possess
for one of you if you would send it to me when you get home Please do
this for now my heart is braking Yours sincerely WILLIAM S BAXTER
ALIAS LITTLE BOY BAXTER


William opened the box of candy and placed the letter upon the top layer
of chocolates Upon the letter he placed a small photograph wrapped in
tissuepaper of himself Then with a pair of scissors he trimmed
an oblong of white cardboard to fit into the box Upon this piece of
cardboard he laboriously wrote copying from a tortured inky sheet
before him

 IN DREAM
 BY WILLIAM S BAXTER

 The sunset light
 Fades into night
 But never will I forget
 The smile that haunts me yet
 Through the future four long years
 I hope you will remember with tears
 Whateer my rank or station
 Whilst receiving my education
 Though far away you seem
 I will see thee in dream

He placed his poem between the photograph and the letter closed the
box and tied the tissuepaper about it again with the blue ribbon
Throughout these rites they were rites both in spirit and in manner he
was subject to little catchings of the breath half gulp half sigh But
the dolorous tokens passed and he sat with elbows upon the table
his chin upon his hands reverie in his eyes Tragedy had given way to
gentler pathosbeyond question something had measurably soothed him
Possibly even in this hour preceding the hour of parting he knew a
little of that proud amazement which any poet is entitled to feel over
each new lyric miracle just wrought

Perhaps he was helped too by wondering what Miss Pratt would think of
him when she read In Dream on the train that afternoon For reasons
purely intuitive and decidedly without foundation in fact he was
satisfied that no rival farewell poem would be offered her and so it
may be that he thought In Dream might show her at last in one blaze
of light what her eyes had sometimes fleetingly intimated she did
perceive in partthe difference between William and such everyday
rather wellmeaning fairly goodhearted people as Joe Bullitt Wallace
Banks Johnnie Watson and others Yes when she came to read In
Dream and to look back upon it all she would surely knowat last

And then when the future four long years while receiving his
education had passed he would go to her He would go to her and
she would take him by the hand and lead him to her father and say
Father this is William

But William would turn to her and with the old dancing light in his
eyes No Lola he would say not William but Ickle Boy Baxter
Always and always just that for you oh my dear

And then as in story and film and farce and the pleasanter kinds of
drama her father would say with kindly raillery Well when you two
young people get through youll find me in the library where I have a
pretty good BUSINESS proposition to lay before YOU young man

And when the whitewaistcoated whitesideburned old man had
chuckling left the room William would slowly lift his arms but Lola
would move back from him a steponly a stepand after laying a finger
archly upon her lips to check him Wait sir she would say I have a
question to ask you sir

What question Lola

THIS question sir she would reply In all that summer sir so long
ago why did you never tell me what you WERE until I had gone away and
it was too late to show you what I felt Ah Ickle Boy Baxter I never
understood until I looked back upon it all after I had read In Dream
on the train that day THEN I KNEW And now Lola William would say
Do you understand me NOW

Shyly she would advance the one short step she had put between
them while he with lifted yearning arms this time destined to no
disappointment

At so vital a moment did Mrs Baxter knock at his door and consoling
reverie cease to minister unto William Out of the rosy sky he dropped
falling miles in an instant landing with a bump He started placed the
sacred box out of sight and spoke gruffly

What you want

Im not coming in Willie said his mother I just wanted to knowI
thought maybe you were looking out of the window and noticed where those
children went

What children

Jane and that little girl from across the streetKirsted her name
must be

No I did not

I just wondered Mrs Baxter said timidly Genesis thinks he
heard the little Kirsted girl telling Jane she had plenty of money for
carfare He thinks they went somewhere on a streetcar I thought maybe
you noticed wheth

I told you I did not

All right she said placatively I didnt mean to bother you dear

Following this there was a silence but no sound of receding footsteps
indicated Mrs Baxters departure from the other side of the closed
door

Well what you WANT William shouted

Nothingnothing at all said the compassionate voice I just thought
Id have lunch a little later than usual not till half past one That
is ifwell I thought probably you meant to go to the station to see
Miss Pratt off on the oneoclock train

Even so friendly an interest as this must have appeared to the quivering
William an intrusion in his affairs for he demanded sharply

Howd you find out shes going at one oclock

Whywhy Jane mentioned it Mrs Baxter replied with obvious
timidity Jane said

She was interrupted by the loud desperate sound of Williams fist
smiting his writingtable so sensitive was his condition This is just
unbearable he cried Nobodys business is safe from that child

Why Willie I dont see how it matters if

He uttered a cry No Nothing matters Nothing matters at all Do you
spose I want that child with her insults discussing when Miss Pratt
is or is not going away Dont you know there are SOME things that have
no business to be talked about by every Tom Dick and Harry

Yes dear she said I understand of course Jane only told me she
met Mr Parcher on the street and he mentioned that Miss Pratt was
going at one oclock today Thats all I

You say you understand he wailed shaking his head drearily at the
closed door and yet even on such a day as this you keep TALKING
Cant you see sometimes theres times when a person cant stand to

Yes Willie Mrs Baxter interposed hurriedly Of course Im going
now I have to go hunt up those children anyway You try to be back for
lunch at half past oneand dont worry dear you really WILL be all
right

She departed a sigh from the abyss following her as she went down the
hall Her comforting words meant nothing pleasant to her son who felt
that her optimism was out of place and tactless He had no intention to
be all right and he desired nobody to interfere with his misery

He went to his mirror and gazing longlong and piercinglyat the
William there limned enacted almost unconsciously a little scene of
parting The look of suffering upon the mirrored face slowly altered in
its place came one still sorrowful but tempered with sweet indulgence
He stretched out his hand as if he set it upon a head at about the
height of his shoulder

Yes it may meanit may mean forever he said in a low tremulous
voice Little girl we MUST be brave

And the while his eyes gazed into the mirror they became expressive
of a momentary pleased surprise as if even in the arts of sorrow he
found himself doing better than he knew But his sorrow was none the
less genuine because of that

Then he noticed the ink upon his forehead and went away to wash When
he returned he did an unusual thinghe brushed his coat thoroughly
removing it for this special purpose After that he earnestly combed
and brushed his hair and retied his tie Next he took from a drawer
two clean handkerchiefs He placed one in his breast pocket part of the
colored border of the handkerchief being left on exhibition and with
the other he carefully wiped his shoes Finally he sawed it back and
forth across them and with a sigh languidly dropped it upon the
floor where it remained

Returning to the mirror he again brushed his hairhe went so far this
time as to brush his eyebrows which seemed not much altered by the
operation Suddenly he was deeply affected by something seen in the
glass

By George he exclaimed aloud

Seizing a small handmirror he placed it in juxtaposition to his right
eye and closely studied his left profile as exhibited in the larger
mirror Then he examined his right profile subjecting it to a like
scrutiny emotional yet attentive and prolonged

By George he exclaimed again By George

He had made a discovery There was a downy shadow upon his upper lip
What he had just found out was that this down could be seen projecting
beyond the line of his lip like a tiny nimbus It could be seen in
PROFILE

By GEORGE William exclaimed

He was still occupied with the two mirrors when his mother again tapped
softly upon his door rousing him as from a dream brief but engaging
to the heavy realities of that day

What you want now

I wont come in said Mrs Baxter I just came to see

See what

I wonderedI thought perhaps you needed something I knew your watch
was out of order

Fr evans sake what if it is

She offered a murmur of placative laughter as her apology and said
Well I just thought Id tell youbecause if you did intend going to
the station I thought you probably wouldnt want to miss it and get
there too late Ive got your hat here all nicely brushed for you Its
nearly twenty minutes of one Willie

WHAT

Yes it is Its

She had no further speech with him

Breathless William flung open his door seized the hat racketed down
the stairs and out through the front door which he left open behind
him Eight seconds later he returned at a gallop hurtled up the stairs
and into his room emerging instantly with something concealed under his
coat Replying incoherently to his mothers inquiries he fell down the
stairs as far as the landing used the impetus thus given as a help to
greater speed for the rest of the descentand passed out of hearing

Mrs Baxter sighed and went to a window in her own room and looked
out

William was already more than halfway to the next corner where there
was a carline that ran to the station but the distance was not too
great for Mrs Baxter to comprehend the nature of the symmetrical white
parcel now carried in his right hand Her face became pensive as she
gazed after the flying slender figurethere came to her mind the
recollection of a seventeenyearold boy who had brought a box of candy
a small one like Williams to the station once long ago when she
had been visiting in another town For just a moment she thought of that
boy she had known so many years ago and a smile came vaguely upon her
lips She wondered what kind of a woman he had married and how many
children he hadand whether he was a widower

The fleeting recollection passed she turned from the window and shook
her head puzzled

Now where on earth could Jane and that little Kirsted girl have gone
she murmured

 At the station William descending from the streetcar found
that he had six minutes to spare Reassured of so much by the great
clock in the station tower he entered the building and with calm
and dignified steps crossed the large waitingroom Those calm
and dignified steps were taken by feet which little betrayed the
tremulousness of the knees above them Moreover though Williams
face was red his expressioncold and concentrated upon high
mattersscorned the stranger and warned the lower classes that the
mission of this bit of gentry was not to them

With but one sweeping and repellent glance over the canaille present
he made sure that the person he sought was not in the waitingroom
Therefore he turned to the doors which gave admission to the tracks
but before he went out he paused for an instant of displeasure Hard by
the doors stood a telephonebooth and from inside this booth a little
girl of nine or ten was peering eagerly out at William her eyes just
above the lower level of the glass window in the door

Even a prospect thus curtailed revealed her as a smudged and dusty
little girl and evidently her mother must have been preoccupied with
some important affair that day but to William she suggested nothing
familiar As his glance happened to encounter hers the peering
eyes grew instantly brighter with excitementshe exposed her whole
countenance at the window and impulsively made a face at him

William had not the slightest recollection of ever having seen her
before

He gave her one stern look and went on though he felt that something
ought to be done The affair was not a personal onepatently this was
a child who played about the station and amused herself by making faces
at everybody who passed the telephoneboothstill the authorities
ought not to allow it People did not come to the station to be
insulted

Three seconds later the dustyfaced little girl and her moue were sped
utterly from Williams mind For as the doors swung together behind
him he saw Miss Pratt There were no gates nor iron barriers to obscure
the view there was no trainshed to darken the air She was at
some distance perhaps two hundred feet along the tracks where
the sleepingcars of the long train would stop But there she stood
mistakable for no other on this wide earth

There she stooda glowing little figure in the hazy September sunlight
her hair an amber mist under the adorable little hat a small bunch
of violets at her waist a larger bunch of fragrant but less expensive
sweet peas in her right hand half a dozen pink roses in her left her
little dog Flopit in the crook of one arm and a onepound box of candy
in the crook of the otherineffable radiant starry there she stood

Near her also stood her young hostess and Wallace Banks Johnnie
Watson and Joe Bullittthree young gentlemen in a condition of
solemn tensity Miss Parcher saw William as he emerged from the
station building and she waved her parasol in greeting attracting the
attention of the others to him so that they all turned and stared

Seventeen sometimes finds it embarrassing even in a state of deep
emotion to walk two hundred feet or thereabout toward a group of
people who steadfastly watch the long approach And when the watching
group contains the lady of all the world before whom one wishes to
appear most debonair and contains not only her but several rivals
who though FAIRLY goodhearted might hardly be trusted to neglect such
an opportunity to murmur something jocular about oneNo it cannot be
said that William appeared to be wholly without selfconsciousness

In fancy he had prophesied for this moment something utterly different
He had seen himself parting from her the two alone as within a cloud
He had seen himself gently placing his box of candy in her hands some
of his fingers just touching some of hers and remaining thus lightly in
contact to the very last He had seen himself bending toward the sweet
blonde head to murmur the few last words of simple eloquence while
her eyes lifted in mysterious appeal to hisand he had put no other
figures not even Miss Parchers into this picture

Parting is the most dramatic moment in young love and if there is one
time when the lover wishes to present a lofty but graceful appearance it
is at the last To leave with the loved one for recollection a final
picture of manly dignity in sorrowthat above all things is
the lovers desire And yet even at the beginning of Williams
twohundredfoot advance later so much discussed he felt the heat
surging over his ears and as he took off his hat thinking to wave it
jauntily in reply to Miss Parcher he made but an uncertain gesture of
it so that he wished he had not tried it Moreover he had covered less
than a third of the distance when he became aware that all of the
group were staring at him with unaccountable eagerness and had begun to
laugh

William felt certain that his attire was in no way disordered nor in
itself a cause for laughterall of these people had often seen him
dressed as he was today and had preserved their gravity But in spite
of himself he took off his hat again and looked to see if anything
about it might explain this mirth which at his action increased Nay
the laughter began to be shared by strangers and some set down their
handluggage for greater pleasure in what they saw

Williams inward state became chaotic

He tried to smile carelessly to prove his composure but he found that
he had lost almost all control over his features He had no knowledge
of his actual expression except that it hurt him In desperation he fell
back upon hauteur he managed to frown and walked proudly At that
they laughed the more Wallace Banks rudely pointing again and again at
William and not till the oncoming sufferer reached a spot within
twenty feet of these delighted people did he grasp the significance of
Wallaces repeated gesture of pointing Even then he understood only
when the gesture was supplemented by halfarticulate shouts

Behind you Look BEHIND you

The stung youth turned

There directly behind him he beheld an exclusive little procession
consisting of two damsels in single file the first soiled with
housemoving the second with apple sauce

For greater caution they had removed their shoes and each damsel
as she paraded dangled from each farextended hand a shoe And both
damsels whether beneath apple sauce or dust smudge were suffused with
the rapture of a great mockery

They were walking with their stummicks out o joint

At sight of Williams face they squealed They turned and ran They got
themselves out of sight

Simultaneously the air filled with solid thunder and the pompous train
shook the ground Ah woes the word This was the thing that meant to
bear away the golden girl and honeysuckle of the worldmeant to and
would not abating one iron second

Now a porter had her handbag

Dear Heaven to be a porteryes a colored one What of that NOW Just
to be a simple porter and journey with her to the far strange pearl
among cities whence she had come

The gentle porter bowed her toward the steps of his car but first she
gave Flopit into the hands of May Parcher for a moment and whispered
a word to Wallace Banks then to Joe Bullitt then to Johnnie
Watsonthen she ran to William

She took his hand

Dont forget she whispered Dont forget Lola

He stood stockstill His face was blank his hand limp He said
nothing

She enfolded May Parcher kissed her devotedly then with Flopit once
more under her arm she ran and jumped upon the steps just as the train
began to move She stood there on the lowest step slowly gliding away
from them and in her eyes there was a sparkle of tears left it may
be from her laughter at poor Williams pageant with Jane and Rannie
Kirstedor it may be not

She could not wave to her friends in answer to their gestures of
farewell for her arms were too full of Flopit and roses and candy and
sweet peas but she kept nodding to them in a way that showed them how
much she thanked them for being sorry she was goingand made it clear
that she was sorry too and loved them all

Goodby she meant

Faster she glided the engine passed from sight round a curve beyond a
culvert but for a moment longer they could see the little figure upon
the stepsand to the very last glimpse they had of her the small
golden head was still nodding Goodby Then those steps whereon she
stood passed in their turn beneath the culvert and they saw her no
more

Lola Pratt was gone

Weteyed her young hostess of the long summer turned away and stumbled
against William Why Willie Baxter she cried blinking at him

The last car of the train had rounded the curve and disappeared but
William was still waving farewellnot with his handkerchief but with
a symmetrical onepound parcel wrapped in white tissuepaper girdled
with blue ribbon

Never mind said May Parcher Lets all walk Uptown together and
talk about her on the way and well go by the expressoffice and you
can send your candy to her by express Willie




XXX

THE BRIDETOBE

In the smallish house which all summer long from morning until late
at night had resounded with the voices of young people echoing their
songs murmurous with their theories of love or vibrating with their
glee sometimes shaking all over during their more boisterous moodsin
that house now comparatively so vacant the proprietor stood and
breathed deep breaths

Hah he said inhaling and exhaling the air profoundly

His wife was upon the porch outside sewing The silence was deep
He seemed to listen to itto listen with gusto his face slowly
broadening a pinkish tint overspreading it His flaccid cheeks appeared
to fill to grow firm again a smile finally widening them

HAH he breathed sonorously He gave himself several resounding slaps
upon the chest then went out to the porch and sat in a rockingchair
near his wife He spread himself out expansively My Glory he said
I believe Ill take off my coat I havent had my coat off outside of
my own room all summer I believe Ill take a vacation By George I
believe Ill stay home this afternoon

Thats nice said Mrs Parcher

Hah he said My Glory I believe Ill take off my shoes

And meeting no objection he proceeded to carry out this plan

HahAH he said and placed his stockinged feet upon the railing
where a number of vines running upon strings made a screen between the
porch and the street He lit a large cigar Well well he said That
tastes good If this keeps on Ill be in as good shape as I was last
spring before you know it Leaning far back in the rockingchair his
hands behind his head he smoked with fervor but suddenly he jumped in
a way which showed that his nerves were far from normal His feet came
to the floor with a thump he jerked the cigar out of his mouth and
turned a face of consternation upon his wife

Whats the matter

Suppose said Mr Patcher huskilysuppose she missed her train

Mrs Parcher shook her head

Think not he said brightening I ordered the liverystable to have
a carriage here in lots of time

They did said Mrs Parcher severely About five dollars worth

Well I dont mind that he returned putting his feet up again
After all she was a mighty fine little girl in her way The only
trouble with me was that crowd of boyshaving to listen to them
certainly liked to killed me and I believe if shed stayed just one
more day Id been a goner Of all the dam boys I ever He paused
listening

Mr Parcher a youthful voice repeated

He rose and separating two of the vines which screened the end of the
porch from the street looked out Two small maidens had paused upon the
sidewalk and were peering over the picket fence

Mr Parcher said Jane as soon as his head appeared between the
vinesMr Parcher Miss Pratts gone Shes gone away on the cars

You think so he asked gravely

We saw her said Jane Rannie an I were there Willie was goin to
chase us I guess but we went in the baggageroom behind trunks an
we saw her go She got on the cars an it went with her in it Honest
shes gone away Mr Parcher

Before speaking Mr Parcher took a long look at this telepathic child
In his fond eyes she was a marvel and a darling

WellTHANK you Jane he said

Jane however had turned her head and was staring at the corner which
was out of his sight

Ooooooh she murmured

Whats the trouble Jane

Willie she said Its Willie an that Joe Bullitt an Johnnie
Watson an Mr Wallace Banks Theyre with Miss May Parcher Theyre
comin right here

Mr Parcher gave forth a low moan and turned pathetically to his wife
but she cheered him with a laugh

Theyve only walked up from the station with May she said They
wont come in Youll see

Relieved Mr Parcher turned again to speak to Janebut she was not
there He caught but a glimpse of her running up the street as fast as
she could hand in hand with her companion

Run Rannie run panted Jane I got to get home an tell mamma about
it before Willie I bet I ketch Hail Columbia anyway when he does get
there

And in this she was not mistaken she caught Hail Columbia It lasted
all afternoon

It was still continuing after dinner Thatt evening when an
oftrepeated yodel followed by a shrillwailed Janeee Oh
JaneNEEee brought her to an open window downstairs In the early
dusk she looked out upon the washed face of Rannie Kirsted who stood on
the lawn below

Come on out Janie Mamma says I can stay outdoors an play till half
past eight

Jane shook her head I cant I cant go outside the house till
tomorrow Its because we walked after Willie with our stummicks out o
joint

Pshaw Rannie cried lightly My mother didnt do anything to me for
that

Well nobody told her on you said Jane reasonably

Cant you come out at all Rannie urged Go ask your mother Tell
her

How can I Jane inquired with a little heat when she isnt here to
ask Shes gone out to play cardsshe and papa

Rannie swung her foot Well she said I guess I haf to find SOMEpn
to do G night

With head bowed in thought she moved away disappearing into the gray
dusk while Jane on her part left the window and went to the open
front door Conscientiously she did not cross the threshold but
restrained herself to looking out On the steps of the porch sat
William alone his back toward the house

Willie said Jane softly and as he made no response she lifted her
voice a little Willee

Whatchwant he grunted not moving

Willie I told mamma I was sorry I made you feel so bad

All right he returned curtly

Well when I haf to go to bed Willie she said mamma told me
because I made you feel bad I haf to go upstairs by myself tonight

She paused seeming to hope that he would say something but he spake
not

Willie I dont haf to go for a while yet but when I domaybe in
about a half an hourI wish youd come stand at the foot of the stairs
till I get up there The lights lit upstairs but down around here
its kind of dark

He did not answer

Will you Willie

Oh all RIGHT he said

This contented her and she seated herself so quietly upon the floor
just inside the door that he ceased to be aware of her thinking she
had gone away He sat staring vacantly into the darkness which had come
on with that abruptness which begins to be noticeable in September
His elbows were on his knees and his body was sunk far forward in an
attitude of desolation

The small noises of the townthat town so empty tonightfell upon his
ears mockingly It seemed to him incredible that so hollow a town could
go about its nightly affairs just as usual A man and a woman going
by laughed loudly at something the man had said the sound of their
laughter was horrid to William And from a great distance from far out
in the countrythere came the faint longdrawn whistle of an engine

That was the sorrowfulest sound of all to William His lonely minds
eye sought the vasty spaces to the east crossed prairie and river and
hill to where a long train whizzed onward through the darkfarther
and farther and farther away William uttered a sigh so hoarse so deep
from the tombs so prolonged that Jane who had been relaxing herself
at full length upon the floor sat up straight with a jerk

But she was wise enough not to speak

Now the full moon came masquerading among the branches of the
shadetrees it came in the likeness of an enormous football gloriously
orange Gorgeously it rose higher cleared the trees and resumed its
wonted impersonation of a silver disk Here was another mockery What
was the use of a moon NOW

Its use appeared straightway

In direct coincidence with that rising moon there came from a little
distance down the street the sound of a young male voice singing
It was not a musical voice yet sufficiently loud and it knew only a
portion of the words and air it sought to render but upon completing
the portion it did know it instantly began again and sang that portion
over and over with brightest patience So the voice approached the
residence of the Baxter family singing what the shades of night gave
courage to singinstead of whistle as in the abashing sunlight

Thus

My countree tis of thee Sweet land of libertee My countree tis
of thee Sweet land of libertee My countree tis of thee Sweet land
of libertee My countree tis of thee Sweet land of libertee My
countree tis


Jane spoke unconsciously Its Freddie she said

William leaped to his feet this was something he could NOT bear He
made a bloodthirsty dash toward the gate which the singer was just in
the act of passing

You GET OUT O HERE William roared

The song stopped Freddie Banks fled like a rag on the wind


 Now here is a strange matter

The antique prophets prophesied successfully they practised with some
ease that art since lost but partly rediscovered by M Maeterlinck who
proves to us that the future already exists simultaneously with the
present Well if his proofs be true then at this very moment when
William thought menacingly of Freddie Banks the bright air of a happy
June eveningan evening ordinarily reckoned ten years nine months and
twentyone days in advance of this present sorrowful eveningthe bright
air of that happy June evening so far in the future was actually
already trembling to a weddingmarch played upon a church organ and
this selfsame Freddie with a white flower in his buttonhole and in
every detail accoutred as a wedding usher was an usher for this very
William who now as we ordinarily count time threatened his person

But for more miracles

As William turned again to resume his meditations upon the steps his
incredulous eyes fell upon a performance amazingly beyond fantasy and
without parallel as a means to make scorn of him Not ten feet from the
porchand in the white moonlight that made brilliant the path to the
gateMiss Mary Randolph Kirsted was walking She was walking with
insulting pomposity in her most pronounced semicircular manner

YOU GET OUT O HERE she said in a voice as deep and hoarse as she
could make it YOU GET OUT O HERE

Her intention was as plain as the moon She was presenting in her own
person a sketch of William by this means expressing her opinion of him
and avenging Jane

YOU GET OUT O HERE she croaked

The shocking audacity took Williams breath He gasped he sought for
words

Why youyou he cried Youyou sootyfaced little girl

In this fashion he directly addressed Miss Mary Randolph Kirsted for the
first time in his life

And that was the strangest thing of this strange evening Strangest
because as with life itself there was nothing remarkable upon the
surface of it But if M Maeterlinck has the right of the matter and
if the bright air of that June evening almost eleven years in the
socalled future was indeed already trembling to Lohengrin then
William stood with Johnnie Watson against a great bank of flowers at the
foot of a church aisle that aisle was roped with whitesatin ribbons
and William and Johnnie were waiting for something important to happen
And then to the strains of Here Comes the Bride it dida stately
solemn roseate gentle young thing with bright eyes seeking through a
veil for Williams eyes

Yes if great M Maeterlinck is right it seems that William ought to
have caught at least some eerie echo of that weddingmarch however
faintsome bars or strains adrift before their time upon the moonlight
of this September night in his eighteenth year

For there beyond the possibility of any fate to intervene or of any
later vague fragmentary memory of even Miss Pratt to impair there in
that moonlight was his future before him

He started forward furiously Youyouyou little

But he paused not wasting his breath upon the empty air

His bridetobe was gone
