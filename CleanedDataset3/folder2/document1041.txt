THE SONNETS

by William Shakespeare




 I

 From fairest creatures we desire increase
 That thereby beautys rose might never die
 But as the riper should by time decease
 His tender heir might bear his memory
 But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
 Feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel
 Making a famine where abundance lies
 Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
 Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament
 And only herald to the gaudy spring
 Within thine own bud buriest thy content
 And tender churl makst waste in niggarding
 Pity the world or else this glutton be
 To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee

 II

 When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
 And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field
 Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now
 Will be a tatterd weed of small worth held
 Then being asked where all thy beauty lies
 Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
 To say within thine own deep sunken eyes
 Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
 How much more praise deservd thy beautys use
 If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine
 Shall sum my count and make my old excuse
 Proving his beauty by succession thine
 This were to be new made when thou art old
 And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold

 III

 Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
 Now is the time that face should form another
 Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
 Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
 For where is she so fair whose uneard womb
 Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
 Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
 Of his selflove to stop posterity
 Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee
 Calls back the lovely April of her prime
 So thou through windows of thine age shalt see
 Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
 But if thou live rememberd not to be
 Die single and thine image dies with thee

 IV

 Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
 Upon thy self thy beautys legacy
 Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend
 And being frank she lends to those are free
 Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
 The bounteous largess given thee to give
 Profitless usurer why dost thou use
 So great a sum of sums yet canst not live
 For having traffic with thy self alone
 Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
 Then how when nature calls thee to be gone
 What acceptable audit canst thou leave
 Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
 Which used lives th executor to be

 V

 Those hours that with gentle work did frame
 The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
 Will play the tyrants to the very same
 And that unfair which fairly doth excel
 For neverresting time leads summer on
 To hideous winter and confounds him there
 Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
 Beauty oersnowed and bareness every where
 Then were not summers distillation left
 A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
 Beautys effect with beauty were bereft
 Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
 But flowers distilld though they with winter meet
 Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet


 VI

 Then let not winters ragged hand deface
 In thee thy summer ere thou be distilld
 Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
 With beautys treasure ere it be selfkilld
 That use is not forbidden usury
 Which happies those that pay the willing loan
 Thats for thy self to breed another thee
 Or ten times happier be it ten for one
 Ten times thy self were happier than thou art
 If ten of thine ten times refigurd thee
 Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
 Leaving thee living in posterity
 Be not selfwilld for thou art much too fair
 To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir

 VII

 Lo in the orient when the gracious light
 Lifts up his burning head each under eye
 Doth homage to his newappearing sight
 Serving with looks his sacred majesty
 And having climbd the steepup heavenly hill
 Resembling strong youth in his middle age
 Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
 Attending on his golden pilgrimage
 But when from highmost pitch with weary car
 Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
 The eyes fore duteous now converted are
 From his low tract and look another way
 So thou thyself outgoing in thy noon
 Unlookd on diest unless thou get a son

 VIII

 Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly
 Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
 Why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly
 Or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy
 If the true concord of welltuned sounds
 By unions married do offend thine ear
 They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
 In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
 Mark how one string sweet husband to another
 Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
 Resembling sire and child and happy mother
 Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
 Whose speechless song being many seeming one
 Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none

 IX

 Is it for fear to wet a widows eye
 That thou consumst thy self in single life
 Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
 The world will wail thee like a makeless wife
 The world will be thy widow and still weep
 That thou no form of thee hast left behind
 When every private widow well may keep
 By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind
 Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
 Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
 But beautys waste hath in the world an end
 And kept unused the user so destroys it
 No love toward others in that bosom sits
 That on himself such murdrous shame commits

 X

 For shame deny that thou bearst love to any
 Who for thy self art so unprovident
 Grant if thou wilt thou art belovd of many
 But that thou none lovst is most evident
 For thou art so possessd with murderous hate
 That gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire
 Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
 Which to repair should be thy chief desire
 O change thy thought that I may change my mind
 Shall hate be fairer lodgd than gentle love
 Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
 Or to thyself at least kindhearted prove
 Make thee another self for love of me
 That beauty still may live in thine or thee

 XI

 As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst
 In one of thine from that which thou departest
 And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst
 Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
 Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
 Without this folly age and cold decay
 If all were minded so the times should cease
 And threescore year would make the world away
 Let those whom nature hath not made for store
 Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
 Look whom she best endowd she gave thee more
 Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
 She carvd thee for her seal and meant thereby
 Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die

 XII

 When I do count the clock that tells the time
 And see the brave day sunk in hideous night
 When I behold the violet past prime
 And sable curls all silvered oer with white
 When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
 Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
 And summers green all girded up in sheaves
 Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
 Then of thy beauty do I question make
 That thou among the wastes of time must go
 Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
 And die as fast as they see others grow
 And nothing gainst Times scythe can make defence
 Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence

 XIII

 O that you were your self but love you are
 No longer yours than you your self here live
 Against this coming end you should prepare
 And your sweet semblance to some other give
 So should that beauty which you hold in lease
 Find no determination then you were
 Yourself again after yourselfs decease
 When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
 Who lets so fair a house fall to decay
 Which husbandry in honour might uphold
 Against the stormy gusts of winters day
 And barren rage of deaths eternal cold
 O none but unthrifts Dear my love you know
 You had a father let your son say so

 XIV

 Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck
 And yet methinks I have astronomy
 But not to tell of good or evil luck
 Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
 Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
 Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
 Or say with princes if it shall go well
 By oft predict that I in heaven find
 But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
 And constant stars in them I read such art
 As Truth and beauty shall together thrive
 If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert
 Or else of thee this I prognosticate
 Thy end is truths and beautys doom and date

 XV

 When I consider every thing that grows
 Holds in perfection but a little moment
 That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
 Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
 When I perceive that men as plants increase
 Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky
 Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
 And wear their brave state out of memory
 Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
 Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
 Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
 To change your day of youth to sullied night
 And all in war with Time for love of you
 As he takes from you I engraft you new

 XVI

 But wherefore do not you a mightier way
 Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time
 And fortify your self in your decay
 With means more blessed than my barren rhyme
 Now stand you on the top of happy hours
 And many maiden gardens yet unset
 With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
 Much liker than your painted counterfeit
 So should the lines of life that life repair
 Which this Times pencil or my pupil pen
 Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
 Can make you live your self in eyes of men
 To give away yourself keeps yourself still
 And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill

 XVII

 Who will believe my verse in time to come
 If it were filld with your most high deserts
 Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
 Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
 If I could write the beauty of your eyes
 And in fresh numbers number all your graces
 The age to come would say This poet lies
 Such heavenly touches neer touchd earthly faces
 So should my papers yellowd with their age
 Be scornd like old men of less truth than tongue
 And your true rights be termd a poets rage
 And stretched metre of an antique song
 But were some child of yours alive that time
 You should live twicein it and in my rhyme

 XVIII

 Shall I compare thee to a summers day
 Thou art more lovely and more temperate
 Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
 And summers lease hath all too short a date
 Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
 And often is his gold complexion dimmd
 And every fair from fair sometime declines
 By chance or natures changing course untrimmd
 But thy eternal summer shall not fade
 Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst
 Nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade
 When in eternal lines to time thou growst
 So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
 So long lives this and this gives life to thee

 XIX

 Devouring Time blunt thou the lions paws
 And make the earth devour her own sweet brood
 Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws
 And burn the longlivd phoenix in her blood
 Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
 And do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted Time
 To the wide world and all her fading sweets
 But I forbid thee one most heinous crime
 O carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow
 Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
 Him in thy course untainted do allow
 For beautys pattern to succeeding men
 Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong
 My love shall in my verse ever live young

 XX

 A womans face with natures own hand painted
 Hast thou the master mistress of my passion
 A womans gentle heart but not acquainted
 With shifting change as is false womens fashion
 An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
 Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
 A man in hue all hues in his controlling
 Which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth
 And for a woman wert thou first created
 Till Nature as she wrought thee fell adoting
 And by addition me of thee defeated
 By adding one thing to my purpose nothing
 But since she prickd thee out for womens pleasure
 Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure

 XXI

 So is it not with me as with that Muse
 Stirrd by a painted beauty to his verse
 Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
 And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
 Making a couplement of proud compare
 With sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems
 With Aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare
 That heavens air in this huge rondure hems
 O let me true in love but truly write
 And then believe me my love is as fair
 As any mothers child though not so bright
 As those gold candles fixd in heavens air
 Let them say more that like of hearsay well
 I will not praise that purpose not to sell

 XXII

 My glass shall not persuade me I am old
 So long as youth and thou are of one date
 But when in thee times furrows I behold
 Then look I death my days should expiate
 For all that beauty that doth cover thee
 Is but the seemly raiment of my heart
 Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
 How can I then be elder than thou art
 O therefore love be of thyself so wary
 As I not for myself but for thee will
 Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
 As tender nurse her babe from faring ill
 Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
 Thou gavst me thine not to give back again

 XXIII

 As an unperfect actor on the stage
 Who with his fear is put beside his part
 Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
 Whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart
 So I for fear of trust forget to say
 The perfect ceremony of loves rite
 And in mine own loves strength seem to decay
 Oerchargd with burthen of mine own loves might
 O let my looks be then the eloquence
 And dumb presagers of my speaking breast
 Who plead for love and look for recompense
 More than that tongue that more hath more expressd
 O learn to read what silent love hath writ
 To hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit

 XXIV

 Mine eye hath playd the painter and hath stelld
 Thy beautys form in table of my heart
 My body is the frame wherein tis held
 And perspective it is best painters art
 For through the painter must you see his skill
 To find where your true image picturd lies
 Which in my bosoms shop is hanging still
 That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
 Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
 Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
 Are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun
 Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
 Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
 They draw but what they see know not the heart

 XXV

 Let those who are in favour with their stars
 Of public honour and proud titles boast
 Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
 Unlookd for joy in that I honour most
 Great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
 But as the marigold at the suns eye
 And in themselves their pride lies buried
 For at a frown they in their glory die
 The painful warrior famoused for fight
 After a thousand victories once foild
 Is from the book of honour razed quite
 And all the rest forgot for which he toild
 Then happy I that love and am belovd
 Where I may not remove nor be removd

 XXVI

 Lord of my love to whom in vassalage
 Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
 To thee I send this written embassage
 To witness duty not to show my wit
 Duty so great which wit so poor as mine
 May make seem bare in wanting words to show it
 But that I hope some good conceit of thine
 In thy souls thought all naked will bestow it
 Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
 Points on me graciously with fair aspect
 And puts apparel on my tatterd loving
 To show me worthy of thy sweet respect
 Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee
 Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me

 XXVII

 Weary with toil I haste me to my bed
 The dear respose for limbs with travel tird
 But then begins a journey in my head
 To work my mind when bodys works expired
 For then my thoughtsfrom far where I abide
 Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
 And keep my drooping eyelids open wide
 Looking on darkness which the blind do see
 Save that my souls imaginary sight
 Presents thy shadow to my sightless view
 Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
 Makes black night beauteous and her old face new
 Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
 For thee and for myself no quiet find

 XXVIII

 How can I then return in happy plight
 That am debarred the benefit of rest
 When days oppression is not easd by night
 But day by night and night by day oppressd
 And each though enemies to eithers reign
 Do in consent shake hands to torture me
 The one by toil the other to complain
 How far I toil still farther off from thee
 I tell the day to please him thou art bright
 And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
 So flatter I the swartcomplexiond night
 When sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even
 But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
 And night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger

 XXIX

 When in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes
 I all alone beweep my outcast state
 And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
 And look upon myself and curse my fate
 Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
 Featurd like him like him with friends possessd
 Desiring this mans art and that mans scope
 With what I most enjoy contented least
 Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
 Haply I think on thee and then my state
 Like to the lark at break of day arising
 From sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
 For thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings
 That then I scorn to change my state with kings

 XXX

 When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
 I summon up remembrance of things past
 I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
 And with old woes new wail my dear times waste
 Then can I drown an eye unused to flow
 For precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
 And weep afresh loves long since cancelld woe
 And moan the expense of many a vanishd sight
 Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
 And heavily from woe to woe tell oer
 The sad account of forebemoaned moan
 Which I new pay as if not paid before
 But if the while I think on thee dear friend
 All losses are restord and sorrows end

 XXXI

 Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
 Which I by lacking have supposed dead
 And there reigns Love and all Loves loving parts
 And all those friends which I thought buried
 How many a holy and obsequious tear
 Hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
 As interest of the dead which now appear
 But things removd that hidden in thee lie
 Thou art the grave where buried love doth live
 Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
 Who all their parts of me to thee did give
 That due of many now is thine alone
 Their images I lovd I view in thee
 And thouall theyhast all the all of me

 XXXII

 If thou survive my wellcontented day
 When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
 And shalt by fortune once more resurvey
 These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
 Compare them with the bettring of the time
 And though they be outstrippd by every pen
 Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
 Exceeded by the height of happier men
 O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
 Had my friends Muse grown with this growing age
 A dearer birth than this his love had brought
 To march in ranks of better equipage
 But since he died and poets better prove
 Theirs for their style Ill read his for his love

 XXXIII

 Full many a glorious morning have I seen
 Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
 Kissing with golden face the meadows green
 Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
 Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
 With ugly rack on his celestial face
 And from the forlorn world his visage hide
 Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
 Even so my sun one early morn did shine
 With all triumphant splendour on my brow
 But out alack he was but one hour mine
 The region cloud hath maskd him from me now
 Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
 Suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth

 XXXIV

 Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
 And make me travel forth without my cloak
 To let base clouds oertake me in my way
 Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
 Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
 To dry the rain on my stormbeaten face
 For no man well of such a salve can speak
 That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
 Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
 Though thou repent yet I have still the loss
 The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
 To him that bears the strong offences cross
 Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
 And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds

 XXXV

 No more be grievd at that which thou hast done
 Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
 Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
 And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
 All men make faults and even I in this
 Authorizing thy trespass with compare
 Myself corrupting salving thy amiss
 Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
 For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense
 Thy adverse party is thy advocate
 And gainst myself a lawful plea commence
 Such civil war is in my love and hate
 That I an accessary needs must be
 To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me

 XXXVI

 Let me confess that we two must be twain
 Although our undivided loves are one
 So shall those blots that do with me remain
 Without thy help by me be borne alone
 In our two loves there is but one respect
 Though in our lives a separable spite
 Which though it alter not loves sole effect
 Yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight
 I may not evermore acknowledge thee
 Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
 Nor thou with public kindness honour me
 Unless thou take that honour from thy name
 But do not so I love thee in such sort
 As thou being mine mine is thy good report

 XXXVII

 As a decrepit father takes delight
 To see his active child do deeds of youth
 So I made lame by Fortunes dearest spite
 Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
 For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
 Or any of these all or all or more
 Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
 I make my love engrafted to this store
 So then I am not lame poor nor despisd
 Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
 That I in thy abundance am sufficd
 And by a part of all thy glory live
 Look what is best that best I wish in thee
 This wish I have then ten times happy me

 XXXVIII

 How can my muse want subject to invent
 While thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse
 Thine own sweet argument too excellent
 For every vulgar paper to rehearse
 O give thy self the thanks if aught in me
 Worthy perusal stand against thy sight
 For whos so dumb that cannot write to thee
 When thou thy self dost give invention light
 Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth
 Than those old nine which rhymers invocate
 And he that calls on thee let him bring forth
 Eternal numbers to outlive long date
 If my slight muse do please these curious days
 The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise

 XXXIX

 O how thy worth with manners may I sing
 When thou art all the better part of me
 What can mine own praise to mine own self bring
 And what ist but mine own when I praise thee
 Even for this let us divided live
 And our dear love lose name of single one
 That by this separation I may give
 That due to thee which thou deservst alone
 O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
 Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
 To entertain the time with thoughts of love
 Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
 And that thou teachest how to make one twain
 By praising him here who doth hence remain

 XL

 Take all my loves my love yea take them all
 What hast thou then more than thou hadst before
 No love my love that thou mayst true love call
 All mine was thine before thou hadst this more
 Then if for my love thou my love receivest
 I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
 But yet be blamd if thou thy self deceivest
 By wilful taste of what thyself refusest
 I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
 Although thou steal thee all my poverty
 And yet love knows it is a greater grief
 To bear loves wrong than hates known injury
 Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
 Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes

 XLI

 Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
 When I am sometime absent from thy heart
 Thy beauty and thy years full well befits
 For still temptation follows where thou art
 Gentle thou art and therefore to be won
 Beauteous thou art therefore to be assaild
 And when a woman woos what womans son
 Will sourly leave her till he have prevaild
 Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
 And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
 Who lead thee in their riot even there
 Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
 Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
 Thine by thy beauty being false to me

 XLII

 That thou hast her it is not all my grief
 And yet it may be said I loved her dearly
 That she hath thee is of my wailing chief
 A loss in love that touches me more nearly
 Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye
 Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her
 And for my sake even so doth she abuse me
 Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her
 If I lose thee my loss is my loves gain
 And losing her my friend hath found that loss
 Both find each other and I lose both twain
 And both for my sake lay on me this cross
 But heres the joy my friend and I are one
 Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone

 XLIII

 When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
 For all the day they view things unrespected
 But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
 And darkly bright are bright in dark directed
 Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
 How would thy shadows form form happy show
 To the clear day with thy much clearer light
 When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
 How would I say mine eyes be blessed made
 By looking on thee in the living day
 When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
 Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
 All days are nights to see till I see thee
 And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me

 XLIV

 If the dull substance of my flesh were thought
 Injurious distance should not stop my way
 For then despite of space I would be brought
 From limits far remote where thou dost stay
 No matter then although my foot did stand
 Upon the farthest earth removd from thee
 For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
 As soon as think the place where he would be
 But ah thought kills me that I am not thought
 To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
 But that so much of earth and water wrought
 I must attend times leisure with my moan
 Receiving nought by elements so slow
 But heavy tears badges of eithers woe

 XLV

 The other two slight air and purging fire
 Are both with thee wherever I abide
 The first my thought the other my desire
 These presentabsent with swift motion slide
 For when these quicker elements are gone
 In tender embassy of love to thee
 My life being made of four with two alone
 Sinks down to death oppressd with melancholy
 Until lifes composition be recurd
 By those swift messengers returnd from thee
 Who even but now come back again assurd
 Of thy fair health recounting it to me
 This told I joy but then no longer glad
 I send them back again and straight grow sad

 XLVI

 Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
 How to divide the conquest of thy sight
 Mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar
 My heart mine eye the freedom of that right
 My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
 A closet never piercd with crystal eyes
 But the defendant doth that plea deny
 And says in him thy fair appearance lies
 To side this title is impannelled
 A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
 And by their verdict is determined
 The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part
 As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part
 And my hearts right thy inward love of heart

 XLVII

 Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
 And each doth good turns now unto the other
 When that mine eye is famishd for a look
 Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
 With my loves picture then my eye doth feast
 And to the painted banquet bids my heart
 Another time mine eye is my hearts guest
 And in his thoughts of love doth share a part
 So either by thy picture or my love
 Thy self away art present still with me
 For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
 And I am still with them and they with thee
 Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
 Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight

 XLVIII

 How careful was I when I took my way
 Each trifle under truest bars to thrust
 That to my use it might unused stay
 From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
 But thou to whom my jewels trifles are
 Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
 Thou best of dearest and mine only care
 Art left the prey of every vulgar thief
 Thee have I not lockd up in any chest
 Save where thou art not though I feel thou art
 Within the gentle closure of my breast
 From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
 And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear
 For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear

 XLIX

 Against that time if ever that time come
 When I shall see thee frown on my defects
 When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
 Calld to that audit by advisd respects
 Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
 And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
 When love converted from the thing it was
 Shall reasons find of settled gravity
 Against that time do I ensconce me here
 Within the knowledge of mine own desert
 And this my hand against my self uprear
 To guard the lawful reasons on thy part
 To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
 Since why to love I can allege no cause

 L

 How heavy do I journey on the way
 When what I seek my weary travels end
 Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
 Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
 The beast that bears me tired with my woe
 Plods dully on to bear that weight in me
 As if by some instinct the wretch did know
 His rider lovd not speed being made from thee
 The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
 That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
 Which heavily he answers with a groan
 More sharp to me than spurring to his side
 For that same groan doth put this in my mind
 My grief lies onward and my joy behind

 LI

 Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
 Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed
 From where thou art why should I haste me thence
 Till I return of posting is no need
 O what excuse will my poor beast then find
 When swift extremity can seem but slow
 Then should I spur though mounted on the wind
 In winged speed no motion shall I know
 Then can no horse with my desire keep pace
 Therefore desire of perfectst love being made
 Shall neighno dull fleshin his fiery race
 But love for love thus shall excuse my jade
 Since from thee going he went wilfulslow
 Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go

 LII

 So am I as the rich whose blessed key
 Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure
 The which he will not every hour survey
 For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
 Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
 Since seldom coming in that long year set
 Like stones of worth they thinly placed are
 Or captain jewels in the carcanet
 So is the time that keeps you as my chest
 Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
 To make some special instant specialblest
 By new unfolding his imprisond pride
 Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
 Being had to triumph being lacked to hope

 LIII

 What is your substance whereof are you made
 That millions of strange shadows on you tend
 Since every one hath every one one shade
 And you but one can every shadow lend
 Describe Adonis and the counterfeit
 Is poorly imitated after you
 On Helens cheek all art of beauty set
 And you in Grecian tires are painted new
 Speak of the spring and foison of the year
 The one doth shadow of your beauty show
 The other as your bounty doth appear
 And you in every blessed shape we know
 In all external grace you have some part
 But you like none none you for constant heart

 LIV

 O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
 By that sweet ornament which truth doth give
 The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
 For that sweet odour which doth in it live
 The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
 As the perfumed tincture of the roses
 Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
 When summers breath their masked buds discloses
 But for their virtue only is their show
 They live unwood and unrespected fade
 Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so
 Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
 And so of you beauteous and lovely youth
 When that shall vade by verse distills your truth

 LV

 Not marble nor the gilded monuments
 Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
 But you shall shine more bright in these contents
 Than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time
 When wasteful war shall statues overturn
 And broils root out the work of masonry
 Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn
 The living record of your memory
 Gainst death and alloblivious enmity
 Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
 Even in the eyes of all posterity
 That wear this world out to the ending doom
 So till the judgment that yourself arise
 You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes

 LVI

 Sweet love renew thy force be it not said
 Thy edge should blunter be than appetite
 Which but today by feeding is allayd
 Tomorrow sharpened in his former might
 So love be thou although today thou fill
 Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
 Tomorrow see again and do not kill
 The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness
 Let this sad interim like the ocean be
 Which parts the shore where two contracted new
 Come daily to the banks that when they see
 Return of love more blest may be the view
 Or call it winter which being full of care
 Makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare

 LVII

 Being your slave what should I do but tend
 Upon the hours and times of your desire
 I have no precious time at all to spend
 Nor services to do till you require
 Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour
 Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you
 Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
 When you have bid your servant once adieu
 Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
 Where you may be or your affairs suppose
 But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
 Save where you are how happy you make those
 So true a fool is love that in your will
 Though you do anything he thinks no ill

 LVIII

 That god forbid that made me first your slave
 I should in thought control your times of pleasure
 Or at your hand the account of hours to crave
 Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
 O let me suffer being at your beck
 The imprisond absence of your liberty
 And patience tame to sufferance bide each check
 Without accusing you of injury
 Be where you list your charter is so strong
 That you yourself may privilage your time
 To what you will to you it doth belong
 Yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime
 I am to wait though waiting so be hell
 Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well

 LIX

 If there be nothing new but that which is
 Hath been before how are our brains beguild
 Which labouring for invention bear amiss
 The second burthen of a former child
 O that record could with a backward look
 Even of five hundred courses of the sun
 Show me your image in some antique book
 Since mind at first in character was done
 That I might see what the old world could say
 To this composed wonder of your frame
 Whr we are mended or whr better they
 Or whether revolution be the same
 O sure I am the wits of former days
 To subjects worse have given admiring praise

 LX

 Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
 So do our minutes hasten to their end
 Each changing place with that which goes before
 In sequent toil all forwards do contend
 Nativity once in the main of light
 Crawls to maturity wherewith being crownd
 Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight
 And Time that gave doth now his gift confound
 Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
 And delves the parallels in beautys brow
 Feeds on the rarities of natures truth
 And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
 And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
 Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand

 LXI

 Is it thy will thy image should keep open
 My heavy eyelids to the weary night
 Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
 While shadows like to thee do mock my sight
 Is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee
 So far from home into my deeds to pry
 To find out shames and idle hours in me
 The scope and tenure of thy jealousy
 O no thy love though much is not so great
 It is my love that keeps mine eye awake
 Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
 To play the watchman ever for thy sake
 For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
 From me far off with others all too near

 LXII

 Sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye
 And all my soul and all my every part
 And for this sin there is no remedy
 It is so grounded inward in my heart
 Methinks no face so gracious is as mine
 No shape so true no truth of such account
 And for myself mine own worth do define
 As I all other in all worths surmount
 But when my glass shows me myself indeed
 Beated and choppd with tanned antiquity
 Mine own selflove quite contrary I read
 Self so selfloving were iniquity
 Tis theemyselfthat for myself I praise
 Painting my age with beauty of thy days

 LXIII

 Against my love shall be as I am now
 With Times injurious hand crushd and oerworn
 When hours have draind his blood and filld his brow
 With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
 Hath travelld on to ages steepy night
 And all those beauties whereof now hes king
 Are vanishing or vanished out of sight
 Stealing away the treasure of his spring
 For such a time do I now fortify
 Against confounding ages cruel knife
 That he shall never cut from memory
 My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life
 His beauty shall in these black lines be seen
 And they shall live and he in them still green

 LXIV

 When I have seen by Times fell hand defacd
 The richproud cost of outworn buried age
 When sometime lofty towers I see downrazd
 And brass eternal slave to mortal rage
 When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
 Advantage on the kingdom of the shore
 And the firm soil win of the watery main
 Increasing store with loss and loss with store
 When I have seen such interchange of state
 Or state itself confounded to decay
 Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
 That Time will come and take my love away
 This thought is as a death which cannot choose
 But weep to have that which it fears to lose

 LXV

 Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
 But sad mortality oersways their power
 How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
 Whose action is no stronger than a flower
 O how shall summers honey breath hold out
 Against the wrackful siege of battering days
 When rocks impregnable are not so stout
 Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays
 O fearful meditation where alack
 Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid
 Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
 Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
 O none unless this miracle have might
 That in black ink my love may still shine bright

 LXVI

 Tired with all these for restful death I cry
 As to behold desert a beggar born
 And needy nothing trimmd in jollity
 And purest faith unhappily forsworn
 And gilded honour shamefully misplacd
 And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
 And right perfection wrongfully disgracd
 And strength by limping sway disabled
 And art made tonguetied by authority
 And follydoctorlikecontrolling skill
 And simple truth miscalld simplicity
 And captive good attending captain ill
 Tird with all these from these would I be gone
 Save that to die I leave my love alone

 LXVII

 Ah wherefore with infection should he live
 And with his presence grace impiety
 That sin by him advantage should achieve
 And lace itself with his society
 Why should false painting imitate his cheek
 And steel dead seeming of his living hue
 Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
 Roses of shadow since his rose is true
 Why should he live now Nature bankrupt is
 Beggard of blood to blush through lively veins
 For she hath no exchequer now but his
 And proud of many lives upon his gains
 O him she stores to show what wealth she had
 In days long since before these last so bad

 LXVIII

 Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
 When beauty lived and died as flowers do now
 Before these bastard signs of fair were born
 Or durst inhabit on a living brow
 Before the golden tresses of the dead
 The right of sepulchres were shorn away
 To live a second life on second head
 Ere beautys dead fleece made another gay
 In him those holy antique hours are seen
 Without all ornament itself and true
 Making no summer of anothers green
 Robbing no old to dress his beauty new
 And him as for a map doth Nature store
 To show false Art what beauty was of yore

 LXIX

 Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view
 Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
 All tonguesthe voice of soulsgive thee that due
 Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
 Thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd
 But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
 In other accents do this praise confound
 By seeing farther than the eye hath shown
 They look into the beauty of thy mind
 And that in guess they measure by thy deeds
 Thenchurlstheir thoughts although their eyes were kind
 To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
 But why thy odour matcheth not thy show
 The soil is this that thou dost common grow

 LXX

 That thou art blamd shall not be thy defect
 For slanders mark was ever yet the fair
 The ornament of beauty is suspect
 A crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
 So thou be good slander doth but approve
 Thy worth the greater being wood of time
 For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
 And thou presentst a pure unstained prime
 Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
 Either not assaild or victor being chargd
 Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
 To tie up envy evermore enlargd
 If some suspect of ill maskd not thy show
 Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe

 LXXI

 No longer mourn for me when I am dead
 Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
 Give warning to the world that I am fled
 From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
 Nay if you read this line remember not
 The hand that writ it for I love you so
 That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
 If thinking on me then should make you woe
 O ifI say you look upon this verse
 When I perhaps compounded am with clay
 Do not so much as my poor name rehearse
 But let your love even with my life decay
 Lest the wise world should look into your moan
 And mock you with me after I am gone

 LXXII

 O lest the world should task you to recite
 What merit lived in me that you should love
 After my deathdear love forget me quite
 For you in me can nothing worthy prove
 Unless you would devise some virtuous lie
 To do more for me than mine own desert
 And hang more praise upon deceased I
 Than niggard truth would willingly impart
 O lest your true love may seem false in this
 That you for love speak well of me untrue
 My name be buried where my body is
 And live no more to shame nor me nor you
 For I am shamed by that which I bring forth
 And so should you to love things nothing worth

 LXXIII

 That time of year thou mayst in me behold
 When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
 Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
 Bare ruind choirs where late the sweet birds sang
 In me thou seest the twilight of such day
 As after sunset fadeth in the west
 Which by and by black night doth take away
 Deaths second self that seals up all in rest
 In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
 That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
 As the deathbed whereon it must expire
 Consumd with that which it was nourishd by
 This thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong
 To love that well which thou must leave ere long

 LXXIV

 But be contented when that fell arrest
 Without all bail shall carry me away
 My life hath in this line some interest
 Which for memorial still with thee shall stay
 When thou reviewest this thou dost review
 The very part was consecrate to thee
 The earth can have but earth which is his due
 My spirit is thine the better part of me
 So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
 The prey of worms my body being dead
 The coward conquest of a wretchs knife
 Too base of thee to be remembered
 The worth of that is that which it contains
 And that is this and this with thee remains

 LXXV

 So are you to my thoughts as food to life
 Or as sweetseasond showers are to the ground
 And for the peace of you I hold such strife
 As twixt a miser and his wealth is found
 Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
 Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
 Now counting best to be with you alone
 Then betterd that the world may see my pleasure
 Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
 And by and by clean starved for a look
 Possessing or pursuing no delight
 Save what is had or must from you be took
 Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day
 Or gluttoning on all or all away

 LXXVI

 Why is my verse so barren of new pride
 So far from variation or quick change
 Why with the time do I not glance aside
 To newfound methods and to compounds strange
 Why write I still all one ever the same
 And keep invention in a noted weed
 That every word doth almost tell my name
 Showing their birth and where they did proceed
 O know sweet love I always write of you
 And you and love are still my argument
 So all my best is dressing old words new
 Spending again what is already spent
 For as the sun is daily new and old
 So is my love still telling what is told

 LXXVII

 Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
 Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
 These vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear
 And of this book this learning mayst thou taste
 The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
 Of mouthed graves will give thee memory
 Thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
 Times thievish progress to eternity
 Look what thy memory cannot contain
 Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
 Those children nursed deliverd from thy brain
 To take a new acquaintance of thy mind
 These offices so oft as thou wilt look
 Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book

 LXXVIII

 So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
 And found such fair assistance in my verse
 As every alien pen hath got my use
 And under thee their poesy disperse
 Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
 And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
 Have added feathers to the learneds wing
 And given grace a double majesty
 Yet be most proud of that which I compile
 Whose influence is thine and born of thee
 In others works thou dost but mend the style
 And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
 But thou art all my art and dost advance
 As high as learning my rude ignorance

 LXXIX

 Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
 My verse alone had all thy gentle grace
 But now my gracious numbers are decayd
 And my sick Muse doth give an other place
 I grant sweet love thy lovely argument
 Deserves the travail of a worthier pen
 Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
 He robs thee of and pays it thee again
 He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
 From thy behaviour beauty doth he give
 And found it in thy cheek he can afford
 No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
 Then thank him not for that which he doth say
 Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay

 LXXX

 O how I faint when I of you do write
 Knowing a better spirit doth use your name
 And in the praise thereof spends all his might
 To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame
 But since your worthwide as the ocean is
 The humble as the proudest sail doth bear
 My saucy bark inferior far to his
 On your broad main doth wilfully appear
 Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
 Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
 Or being wrackd I am a worthless boat
 He of tall building and of goodly pride
 Then if he thrive and I be cast away
 The worst was thismy love was my decay

 LXXXI

 Or I shall live your epitaph to make
 Or you survive when I in earth am rotten
 From hence your memory death cannot take
 Although in me each part will be forgotten
 Your name from hence immortal life shall have
 Though I once gone to all the world must die
 The earth can yield me but a common grave
 When you entombed in mens eyes shall lie
 Your monument shall be my gentle verse
 Which eyes not yet created shall oerread
 And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
 When all the breathers of this world are dead
 You still shall livesuch virtue hath my pen
 Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men

 LXXXII

 I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
 And therefore mayst without attaint oerlook
 The dedicated words which writers use
 Of their fair subject blessing every book
 Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
 Finding thy worth a limit past my praise
 And therefore art enforced to seek anew
 Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days
 And do so love yet when they have devisd
 What strained touches rhetoric can lend
 Thou truly fair wert truly sympathizd
 In true plain words by thy truetelling friend
 And their gross painting might be better usd
 Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abusd

 LXXXIII

 I never saw that you did painting need
 And therefore to your fair no painting set
 I found or thought I found you did exceed
 That barren tender of a poets debt
 And therefore have I slept in your report
 That you yourself being extant well might show
 How far a modern quill doth come too short
 Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
 This silence for my sin you did impute
 Which shall be most my glory being dumb
 For I impair not beauty being mute
 When others would give life and bring a tomb
 There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
 Than both your poets can in praise devise

 LXXXIV

 Who is it that says most which can say more
 Than this rich praisethat you alone are you
 In whose confine immured is the store
 Which should example where your equal grew
 Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
 That to his subject lends not some small glory
 But he that writes of you if he can tell
 That you are you so dignifies his story
 Let him but copy what in you is writ
 Not making worse what nature made so clear
 And such a counterpart shall fame his wit
 Making his style admired every where
 You to your beauteous blessings add a curse
 Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse

 LXXXV

 My tonguetied Muse in manners holds her still
 While comments of your praise richly compild
 Reserve their character with golden quill
 And precious phrase by all the Muses fild
 I think good thoughts whilst others write good words
 And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen
 To every hymn that able spirit affords
 In polishd form of wellrefined pen
 Hearing you praised I say tis so tis true
 And to the most of praise add something more
 But that is in my thought whose love to you
 Though words come hindmost holds his rank before
 Then others for the breath of words respect
 Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect

 LXXXVI

 Was it the proud full sail of his great verse
 Bound for the prize of all too precious you
 That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
 Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
 Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
 Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
 No neither he nor his compeers by night
 Giving him aid my verse astonished
 He nor that affable familiar ghost
 Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
 As victors of my silence cannot boast
 I was not sick of any fear from thence
 But when your countenance filld up his line
 Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine

 LXXXVII

 Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
 And like enough thou knowst thy estimate
 The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
 My bonds in thee are all determinate
 For how do I hold thee but by thy granting
 And for that riches where is my deserving
 The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
 And so my patent back again is swerving
 Thy self thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing
 Or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking
 So thy great gift upon misprision growing
 Comes home again on better judgement making
 Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter
 In sleep a king but waking no such matter

 LXXXVIII

 When thou shalt be disposd to set me light
 And place my merit in the eye of scorn
 Upon thy side against myself Ill fight
 And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
 With mine own weakness being best acquainted
 Upon thy part I can set down a story
 Of faults conceald wherein I am attainted
 That thou in losing me shalt win much glory
 And I by this will be a gainer too
 For bending all my loving thoughts on thee
 The injuries that to myself I do
 Doing thee vantage doublevantage me
 Such is my love to thee I so belong
 That for thy right myself will bear all wrong

 LXXXIX

 Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
 And I will comment upon that offence
 Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt
 Against thy reasons making no defence
 Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
 To set a form upon desired change
 As Ill myself disgrace knowing thy will
 I will acquaintance strangle and look strange
 Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
 Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
 Lest I too much profane should do it wrong
 And haply of our old acquaintance tell
 For thee against my self Ill vow debate
 For I must neer love him whom thou dost hate

 XC

 Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
 Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
 Join with the spite of fortune make me bow
 And do not drop in for an afterloss
 Ah do not when my heart hath scapd this sorrow
 Come in the rearward of a conquerd woe
 Give not a windy night a rainy morrow
 To linger out a purposd overthrow
 If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
 When other petty griefs have done their spite
 But in the onset come so shall I taste
 At first the very worst of fortunes might
 And other strains of woe which now seem woe
 Compard with loss of thee will not seem so

 XCI

 Some glory in their birth some in their skill
 Some in their wealth some in their bodys force
 Some in their garments though newfangled ill
 Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
 And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
 Wherein it finds a joy above the rest
 But these particulars are not my measure
 All these I better in one general best
 Thy love is better than high birth to me
 Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs
 Of more delight than hawks and horses be
 And having thee of all mens pride I boast
 Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
 All this away and me most wretchcd make

 XCII

 But do thy worst to steal thyself away
 For term of life thou art assured mine
 And life no longer than thy love will stay
 For it depends upon that love of thine
 Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs
 When in the least of them my life hath end
 I see a better state to me belongs
 Than that which on thy humour doth depend
 Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
 Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
 O what a happy title do I find
 Happy to have thy love happy to die
 But whats so blessedfair that fears no blot
 Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not

 XCIII

 So shall I live supposing thou art true
 Like a deceived husband so loves face
 May still seem love to me though alterd new
 Thy looks with me thy heart in other place
 For there can live no hatred in thine eye
 Therefore in that I cannot know thy change
 In manys looks the false hearts history
 Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
 But heaven in thy creation did decree
 That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
 Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be
 Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
 How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow
 If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show

 XCIV

 They that have power to hurt and will do none
 That do not do the thing they most do show
 Who moving others are themselves as stone
 Unmoved cold and to temptation slow
 They rightly do inherit heavens graces
 And husband natures riches from expense
 They are the lords and owners of their faces
 Others but stewards of their excellence
 The summers flower is to the summer sweet
 Though to itself it only live and die
 But if that flower with base infection meet
 The basest weed outbraves his dignity
 For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
 Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds

 XCV

 How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
 Which like a canker in the fragrant rose
 Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
 O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
 That tongue that tells the story of thy days
 Making lascivious comments on thy sport
 Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
 Naming thy name blesses an ill report
 O what a mansion have those vices got
 Which for their habitation chose out thee
 Where beautys veil doth cover every blot
 And all things turns to fair that eyes can see
 Take heed dear heart of this large privilege
 The hardest knife illusd doth lose his edge

 XCVI

 Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
 Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
 Both grace and faults are lovd of more and less
 Thou makst faults graces that to thee resort
 As on the finger of a throned queen
 The basest jewel will be well esteemd
 So are those errors that in thee are seen
 To truths translated and for true things deemd
 How many lambs might the stern wolf betray
 If like a lamb he could his looks translate
 How many gazers mightst thou lead away
 if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
 But do not so I love thee in such sort
 As thou being mine mine is thy good report

 XCVII

 How like a winter hath my absence been
 From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
 What freezings have I felt what dark days seen
 What old Decembers bareness everywhere
 And yet this time removed was summers time
 The teeming autumn big with rich increase
 Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
 Like widowd wombs after their lords decease
 Yet this abundant issue seemd to me
 But hope of orphans and unfatherd fruit
 For summer and his pleasures wait on thee
 And thou away the very birds are mute
 Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
 That leaves look pale dreading the winters near

 XCVIII

 From you have I been absent in the spring
 When proudpied April dressd in all his trim
 Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
 That heavy Saturn laughd and leapd with him
 Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
 Of different flowers in odour and in hue
 Could make me any summers story tell
 Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
 Nor did I wonder at the lilys white
 Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
 They were but sweet but figures of delight
 Drawn after you you pattern of all those
 Yet seemd it winter still and you away
 As with your shadow I with these did play

 XCIX

 The forward violet thus did I chide
 Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
 If not from my loves breath The purple pride
 Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
 In my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyd
 The lily I condemned for thy hand
 And buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair
 The roses fearfully on thorns did stand
 One blushing shame another white despair
 A third nor red nor white had stoln of both
 And to his robbery had annexd thy breath
 But for his theft in pride of all his growth
 A vengeful canker eat him up to death
 More flowers I noted yet I none could see
 But sweet or colour it had stoln from thee

 C

 Where art thou Muse that thou forgetst so long
 To speak of that which gives thee all thy might
 Spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song
 Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
 Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem
 In gentle numbers time so idly spent
 Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
 And gives thy pen both skill and argument
 Rise resty Muse my loves sweet face survey
 If Time have any wrinkle graven there
 If any be a satire to decay
 And make times spoils despised every where
 Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life
 So thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife

 CI

 O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
 For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyd
 Both truth and beauty on my love depends
 So dost thou too and therein dignified
 Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say
 Truth needs no colour with his colour fixd
 Beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay
 But best is best if never intermixd
 Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
 Excuse not silence so fort lies in thee
 To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
 And to be praisd of ages yet to be
 Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how
 To make him seem long hence as he shows now

 CII

 My love is strengthend though more weak in seeming
 I love not less though less the show appear
 That love is merchandizd whose rich esteeming
 The owners tongue doth publish every where
 Our love was new and then but in the spring
 When I was wont to greet it with my lays
 As Philomel in summers front doth sing
 And stops her pipe in growth of riper days
 Not that the summer is less pleasant now
 Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
 But that wild music burthens every bough
 And sweets grown common lose their dear delight
 Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue
 Because I would not dull you with my song

 CIII

 Alack what poverty my Muse brings forth
 That having such a scope to show her pride
 The argument all bare is of more worth
 Than when it hath my added praise beside
 O blame me not if I no more can write
 Look in your glass and there appears a face
 That overgoes my blunt invention quite
 Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
 Were it not sinful then striving to mend
 To mar the subject that before was well
 For to no other pass my verses tend
 Than of your graces and your gifts to tell
 And more much more than in my verse can sit
 Your own glass shows you when you look in it

 CIV

 To me fair friend you never can be old
 For as you were when first your eye I eyd
 Such seems your beauty still Three winters cold
 Have from the forests shook three summers pride
 Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnd
 In process of the seasons have I seen
 Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burnd
 Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green
 Ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand
 Steal from his figure and no pace perceivd
 So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
 Hath motion and mine eye may be deceivd
 For fear of which hear this thou age unbred
 Ere you were born was beautys summer dead

 CV

 Let not my love be calld idolatry
 Nor my beloved as an idol show
 Since all alike my songs and praises be
 To one of one still such and ever so
 Kind is my love today tomorrow kind
 Still constant in a wondrous excellence
 Therefore my verse to constancy confind
 One thing expressing leaves out difference
 Fair kind and true is all my argument
 Fair kind and true varying to other words
 And in this change is my invention spent
 Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
 Fair kind and true have often livd alone
 Which three till now never kept seat in one

 CVI

 When in the chronicle of wasted time
 I see descriptions of the fairest wights
 And beauty making beautiful old rime
 In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
 Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best
 Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
 I see their antique pen would have expressd
 Even such a beauty as you master now
 So all their praises are but prophecies
 Of this our time all you prefiguring
 And for they looked but with divining eyes
 They had not skill enough your worth to sing
 For we which now behold these present days
 Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise

 CVII

 Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
 Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
 Can yet the lease of my true love control
 Supposed as forfeit to a confind doom
 The mortal moon hath her eclipse endurd
 And the sad augurs mock their own presage
 Incertainties now crown themselves assurd
 And peace proclaims olives of endless age
 Now with the drops of this most balmy time
 My love looks fresh and Death to me subscribes
 Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rime
 While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes
 And thou in this shalt find thy monument
 When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent

 CVIII

 Whats in the brain that ink may character
 Which hath not figurd to thee my true spirit
 Whats new to speak what now to register
 That may express my love or thy dear merit
 Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
 I must each day say oer the very same
 Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine
 Even as when first I hallowd thy fair name
 So that eternal love in loves fresh case
 Weighs not the dust and injury of age
 Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
 But makes antiquity for aye his page
 Finding the first conceit of love there bred
 Where time and outward form would show it dead

 CIX

 O never say that I was false of heart
 Though absence seemd my flame to qualify
 As easy might I from my self depart
 As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
 That is my home of love if I have rangd
 Like him that travels I return again
 Just to the time not with the time exchangd
 So that myself bring water for my stain
 Never believe though in my nature reignd
 All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
 That it could so preposterously be staind
 To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
 For nothing this wide universe I call
 Save thou my rose in it thou art my all

 CX

 Alas tis true I have gone here and there
 And made my self a motley to the view
 Gord mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
 Made old offences of affections new
 Most true it is that I have lookd on truth
 Askance and strangely but by all above
 These blenches gave my heart another youth
 And worse essays provd thee my best of love
 Now all is done save what shall have no end
 Mine appetite I never more will grind
 On newer proof to try an older friend
 A god in love to whom I am confind
 Then give me welcome next my heaven the best
 Even to thy pure and most most loving breast

 CXI

 O for my sake do you with Fortune chide
 The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
 That did not better for my life provide
 Than public means which public manners breeds
 Thence comes it that my name receives a brand
 And almost thence my nature is subdud
 To what it works in like the dyers hand
 Pity me then and wish I were renewd
 Whilst like a willing patient I will drink
 Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
 No bitterness that I will bitter think
 Nor double penance to correct correction
 Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye
 Even that your pity is enough to cure me

 CXII

 Your love and pity doth the impression fill
 Which vulgar scandal stampd upon my brow
 For what care I who calls me well or ill
 So you oergreen my bad my good allow
 You are my alltheworld and I must strive
 To know my shames and praises from your tongue
 None else to me nor I to none alive
 That my steeld sense or changes right or wrong
 In so profound abysm I throw all care
 Of others voices that my adders sense
 To critic and to flatterer stopped are
 Mark how with my neglect I do dispense
 You are so strongly in my purpose bred
 That all the world besides methinks are dead

 CXIII

 Since I left you mine eye is in my mind
 And that which governs me to go about
 Doth part his function and is partly blind
 Seems seeing but effectually is out
 For it no form delivers to the heart
 Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
 Of his quick objects hath the mind no part
 Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
 For if it see the rudst or gentlest sight
 The most sweet favour or deformedst creature
 The mountain or the sea the day or night
 The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
 Incapable of more replete with you
 My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue

 CXIV

 Or whether doth my mind being crownd with you
 Drink up the monarchs plague this flattery
 Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true
 And that your love taught it this alchemy
 To make of monsters and things indigest
 Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
 Creating every bad a perfect best
 As fast as objects to his beams assemble
 O tis the first tis flattery in my seeing
 And my great mind most kingly drinks it up
 Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing
 And to his palate doth prepare the cup
 If it be poisond tis the lesser sin
 That mine eye loves it and doth first begin

 CXV

 Those lines that I before have writ do lie
 Even those that said I could not love you dearer
 Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
 My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
 But reckoning Time whose milliond accidents
 Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings
 Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents
 Divert strong minds to the course of altering things
 Alas why fearing of Times tyranny
 Might I not then say Now I love you best
 When I was certain oer incertainty
 Crowning the present doubting of the rest
 Love is a babe then might I not say so
 To give full growth to that which still doth grow

 CXVI

 Let me not to the marriage of true minds
 Admit impediments Love is not love
 Which alters when it alteration finds
 Or bends with the remover to remove
 O no it is an everfixed mark
 That looks on tempests and is never shaken
 It is the star to every wandering bark
 Whose worths unknown although his height be taken
 Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
 Within his bending sickles compass come
 Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
 But bears it out even to the edge of doom
 If this be error and upon me provd
 I never writ nor no man ever lovd

 CXVII

 Accuse me thus that I have scanted all
 Wherein I should your great deserts repay
 Forgot upon your dearest love to call
 Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
 That I have frequent been with unknown minds
 And given to time your own dearpurchasd right
 That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
 Which should transport me farthest from your sight
 Book both my wilfulness and errors down
 And on just proof surmise accumulate
 Bring me within the level of your frown
 But shoot not at me in your wakend hate
 Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
 The constancy and virtue of your love

 CXVIII

 Like as to make our appetite more keen
 With eager compounds we our palate urge
 As to prevent our maladies unseen
 We sicken to shun sickness when we purge
 Even so being full of your neercloying sweetness
 To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
 And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
 To be diseasd ere that there was true needing
 Thus policy in love to anticipate
 The ills that were not grew to faults assurd
 And brought to medicine a healthful state
 Which rank of goodness would by ill be curd
 But thence I learn and find the lesson true
 Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you

 CXIX

 What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
 Distilld from limbecks foul as hell within
 Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
 Still losing when I saw myself to win
 What wretched errors hath my heart committed
 Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never
 How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
 In the distraction of this madding fever
 O benefit of ill now I find true
 That better is by evil still made better
 And ruind love when it is built anew
 Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
 So I return rebukd to my content
 And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent

 CXX

 That you were once unkind befriends me now
 And for that sorrow which I then did feel
 Needs must I under my transgression bow
 Unless my nerves were brass or hammerd steel
 For if you were by my unkindness shaken
 As I by yours youve passd a hell of time
 And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
 To weigh how once I sufferd in your crime
 O that our night of woe might have rememberd
 My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
 And soon to you as you to me then tenderd
 The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
 But that your trespass now becomes a fee
 Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me

 CXXI

 Tis better to be vile than vile esteemd
 When not to be receives reproach of being
 And the just pleasure lost which is so deemd
 Not by our feeling but by others seeing
 For why should others false adulterate eyes
 Give salutation to my sportive blood
 Or on my frailties why are frailer spies
 Which in their wills count bad what I think good
 No I am that I am and they that level
 At my abuses reckon up their own
 I may be straight though they themselves be bevel
 By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
 Unless this general evil they maintain
 All men are bad and in their badness reign

 CXXII

 Thy gift thy tables are within my brain
 Full characterd with lasting memory
 Which shall above that idle rank remain
 Beyond all date even to eternity
 Or at the least so long as brain and heart
 Have faculty by nature to subsist
 Till each to razd oblivion yield his part
 Of thee thy record never can be missd
 That poor retention could not so much hold
 Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score
 Therefore to give them from me was I bold
 To trust those tables that receive thee more
 To keep an adjunct to remember thee
 Were to import forgetfulness in me

 CXXIII

 No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change
 Thy pyramids built up with newer might
 To me are nothing novel nothing strange
 They are but dressings of a former sight
 Our dates are brief and therefore we admire
 What thou dost foist upon us that is old
 And rather make them born to our desire
 Than think that we before have heard them told
 Thy registers and thee I both defy
 Not wondering at the present nor the past
 For thy records and what we see doth lie
 Made more or less by thy continual haste
 This I do vow and this shall ever be
 I will be true despite thy scythe and thee

 CXXIV

 If my dear love were but the child of state
 It might for Fortunes bastard be unfatherd
 As subject to Times love or to Times hate
 Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gatherd
 No it was builded far from accident
 It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
 Under the blow of thralled discontent
 Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls
 It fears not policy that heretic
 Which works on leases of shortnumberd hours
 But all alone stands hugely politic
 That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
 To this I witness call the fools of time
 Which die for goodness who have lived for crime

 CXXV

 Weret aught to me I bore the canopy
 With my extern the outward honouring
 Or laid great bases for eternity
 Which proves more short than waste or ruining
 Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
 Lose all and more by paying too much rent
 For compound sweet forgoing simple savour
 Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
 No let me be obsequious in thy heart
 And take thou my oblation poor but free
 Which is not mixd with seconds knows no art
 But mutual render only me for thee
 Hence thou suborned informer a true soul
 When most impeachd stands least in thy control

 CXXVI

 O thou my lovely boy who in thy power
 Dost hold Times fickle glass his fickle hour
 Who hast by waning grown and therein showst
 Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst
 If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack
 As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
 She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
 May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
 Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure
 She may detain but not still keep her treasure
 Her audit though delayed answered must be
 And her quietus is to render thee

 CXXVII

 In the old age black was not counted fair
 Or if it were it bore not beautys name
 But now is black beautys successive heir
 And beauty slanderd with a bastard shame
 For since each hand hath put on Natures power
 Fairing the foul with Arts false borrowed face
 Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
 But is profand if not lives in disgrace
 Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black
 Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
 At such who not born fair no beauty lack
 Slandring creation with a false esteem
 Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
 That every tongue says beauty should look so

 CXXVIII

 How oft when thou my music music playst
 Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
 With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst
 The wiry concord that mine ear confounds
 Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
 To kiss the tender inward of thy hand
 Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
 At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand
 To be so tickled they would change their state
 And situation with those dancing chips
 Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
 Making dead wood more blessd than living lips
 Since saucy jacks so happy are in this
 Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss

 CXXIX

 The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
 Is lust in action and till action lust
 Is perjurd murderous bloody full of blame
 Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
 Enjoyd no sooner but despised straight
 Past reason hunted and no sooner had
 Past reason hated as a swallowd bait
 On purpose laid to make the taker mad
 Mad in pursuit and in possession so
 Had having and in quest to have extreme
 A bliss in proof and provd a very woe
 Before a joy proposd behind a dream
 All this the world well knows yet none knows well
 To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell

 CXXX

 My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
 Coral is far more red than her lips red
 If snow be white why then her breasts are dun
 If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
 I have seen roses damaskd red and white
 But no such roses see I in her cheeks
 And in some perfumes is there more delight
 Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
 I love to hear her speak yet well I know
 That music hath a far more pleasing sound
 I grant I never saw a goddess go
 My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
 And yet by heaven I think my love as rare
 As any she belied with false compare

 CXXXI

 Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
 As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
 For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart
 Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
 Yet in good faith some say that thee behold
 Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
 To say they err I dare not be so bold
 Although I swear it to myself alone
 And to be sure that is not false I swear
 A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
 One on anothers neck do witness bear
 Thy black is fairest in my judgments place
 In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
 And thence this slander as I think proceeds

 CXXXII

 Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me
 Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
 Have put on black and loving mourners be
 Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
 And truly not the morning sun of heaven
 Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
 Nor that full star that ushers in the even
 Doth half that glory to the sober west
 As those two mourning eyes become thy face
 O let it then as well beseem thy heart
 To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
 And suit thy pity like in every part
 Then will I swear beauty herself is black
 And all they foul that thy complexion lack

 CXXXIII

 Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
 For that deep wound it gives my friend and me
 Ist not enough to torture me alone
 But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be
 Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
 And my next self thou harder hast engrossd
 Of him myself and thee I am forsaken
 A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossd
 Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward
 But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail
 Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard
 Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail
 And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee
 Perforce am thine and all that is in me

 CXXXIV

 So now I have confessd that he is thine
 And I my self am mortgagd to thy will
 Myself Ill forfeit so that other mine
 Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
 But thou wilt not nor he will not be free
 For thou art covetous and he is kind
 He learnd but suretylike to write for me
 Under that bond that him as fast doth bind
 The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
 Thou usurer that puttst forth all to use
 And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
 So him I lose through my unkind abuse
 Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
 He pays the whole and yet am I not free

 CXXXV

 Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy Will
 And Will to boot and Will in overplus
 More than enough am I that vexd thee still
 To thy sweet will making addition thus
 Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
 Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
 Shall will in others seem right gracious
 And in my will no fair acceptance shine
 The sea all water yet receives rain still
 And in abundance addeth to his store
 So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will
 One will of mine to make thy large will more
 Let no unkind No fair beseechers kill
 Think all but one and me in that one Will

 CXXXVI

 If thy soul check thee that I come so near
 Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will
 And will thy soul knows is admitted there
 Thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil
 Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
 Ay fill it full with wills and my will one
 In things of great receipt with ease we prove
 Among a number one is reckond none
 Then in the number let me pass untold
 Though in thy stores account I one must be
 For nothing hold me so it please thee hold
 That nothing me a something sweet to thee
 Make but my name thy love and love that still
 And then thou lovst me for my name is Will

 CXXXVII

 Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes
 That they behold and see not what they see
 They know what beauty is see where it lies
 Yet what the best is take the worst to be
 If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks
 Be anchord in the bay where all men ride
 Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
 Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
 Why should my heart think that a several plot
 Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place
 Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
 To put fair truth upon so foul a face
 In things right true my heart and eyes have errd
 And to this false plague are they now transferrd

 CXXXVIII

 When my love swears that she is made of truth
 I do believe her though I know she lies
 That she might think me some untutord youth
 Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties
 Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
 Although she knows my days are past the best
 Simply I credit her falsespeaking tongue
 On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
 But wherefore says she not she is unjust
 And wherefore say not I that I am old
 O loves best habit is in seeming trust
 And age in love loves not to have years told
 Therefore I lie with her and she with me
 And in our faults by lies we flatterd be

 CXXXIX

 O call not me to justify the wrong
 That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
 Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
 Use power with power and slay me not by art
 Tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight
 Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
 What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might
 Is more than my oerpressd defence can bide
 Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
 Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
 And therefore from my face she turns my foes
 That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
 Yet do not so but since I am near slain
 Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain


 CXL

 Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
 My tonguetied patience with too much disdain
 Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
 The manner of my pitywanting pain
 If I might teach thee wit better it were
 Though not to love yet love to tell me so
 As testy sick men when their deaths be near
 No news but health from their physicians know
 For if I should despair I should grow mad
 And in my madness might speak ill of thee
 Now this illwresting world is grown so bad
 Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
 That I may not be so nor thou belied
 Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide

 CXLI

 In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes
 For they in thee a thousand errors note
 But tis my heart that loves what they despise
 Who in despite of view is pleased to dote
 Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted
 Nor tender feeling to base touches prone
 Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
 To any sensual feast with thee alone
 But my five wits nor my five senses can
 Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
 Who leaves unswayd the likeness of a man
 Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
 Only my plague thus far I count my gain
 That she that makes me sin awards me pain

 CXLII

 Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
 Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
 O but with mine compare thou thine own state
 And thou shalt find it merits not reproving
 Or if it do not from those lips of thine
 That have profand their scarlet ornaments
 And seald false bonds of love as oft as mine
 Robbd others beds revenues of their rents
 Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those
 Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
 Root pity in thy heart that when it grows
 Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
 If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
 By selfexample mayst thou be denied

 CXLIII

 Lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
 One of her featherd creatures broke away
 Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
 In pursuit of the thing she would have stay
 Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
 Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
 To follow that which flies before her face
 Not prizing her poor infants discontent
 So runnst thou after that which flies from thee
 Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind
 But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
 And play the mothers part kiss me be kind
 So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will
 If thou turn back and my loud crying still

 CXLIV

 Two loves I have of comfort and despair
 Which like two spirits do suggest me still
 The better angel is a man right fair
 The worser spirit a woman colourd ill
 To win me soon to hell my female evil
 Tempteth my better angel from my side
 And would corrupt my saint to be a devil
 Wooing his purity with her foul pride
 And whether that my angel be turnd fiend
 Suspect I may yet not directly tell
 But being both from me both to each friend
 I guess one angel in anothers hell
 Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt
 Till my bad angel fire my good one out

 CXLV

 Those lips that Loves own hand did make
 Breathed forth the sound that said I hate
 To me that languishd for her sake
 But when she saw my woeful state
 Straight in her heart did mercy come
 Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
 Was usd in giving gentle doom
 And taught it thus anew to greet
 I hate she alterd with an end
 That followed it as gentle day
 Doth follow night who like a fiend
 From heaven to hell is flown away
 I hate from hate away she threw
 And savd my life saying not you

 CXLVI

 Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
 My sinful earth these rebel powers array
 Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
 Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
 Why so large cost having so short a lease
 Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
 Shall worms inheritors of this excess
 Eat up thy charge Is this thy bodys end
 Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
 And let that pine to aggravate thy store
 Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
 Within be fed without be rich no more
 So shall thou feed on Death that feeds on men
 And Death once dead theres no more dying then

 CXLVII

 My love is as a fever longing still
 For that which longer nurseth the disease
 Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
 The uncertain sickly appetite to please
 My reason the physician to my love
 Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
 Hath left me and I desperate now approve
 Desire is death which physic did except
 Past cure I am now Reason is past care
 And franticmad with evermore unrest
 My thoughts and my discourse as madmens are
 At random from the truth vainly expressd
 For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
 Who art as black as hell as dark as night

 CXLVIII

 O me what eyes hath Love put in my head
 Which have no correspondence with true sight
 Or if they have where is my judgment fled
 That censures falsely what they see aright
 If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
 What means the world to say it is not so
 If it be not then love doth well denote
 Loves eye is not so true as all mens no
 How can it O how can Loves eye be true
 That is so vexed with watching and with tears
 No marvel then though I mistake my view
 The sun itself sees not till heaven clears
 O cunning Love with tears thou keepst me blind
 Lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find

 CXLIX

 Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not
 When I against myself with thee partake
 Do I not think on thee when I forgot
 Am of my self all tyrant for thy sake
 Who hateth thee that I do call my friend
 On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon
 Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend
 Revenge upon myself with present moan
 What merit do I in my self respect
 That is so proud thy service to despise
 When all my best doth worship thy defect
 Commanded by the motion of thine eyes
 But love hate on for now I know thy mind
 Those that can see thou lovst and I am blind

 CL

 O from what power hast thou this powerful might
 With insufficiency my heart to sway
 To make me give the lie to my true sight
 And swear that brightness doth not grace the day
 Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
 That in the very refuse of thy deeds
 There is such strength and warrantise of skill
 That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
 Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
 The more I hear and see just cause of hate
 O though I love what others do abhor
 With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
 If thy unworthiness raisd love in me
 More worthy I to be belovd of thee

 CLI

 Love is too young to know what conscience is
 Yet who knows not conscience is born of love
 Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
 Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
 For thou betraying me I do betray
 My nobler part to my gross bodys treason
 My soul doth tell my body that he may
 Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason
 But rising at thy name doth point out thee
 As his triumphant prize Proud of this pride
 He is contented thy poor drudge to be
 To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
 No want of conscience hold it that I call
 Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall

 CLII

 In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn
 But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
 In act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn
 In vowing new hate after new love bearing
 But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee
 When I break twenty I am perjurd most
 For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
 And all my honest faith in thee is lost
 For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
 Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
 And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
 Or made them swear against the thing they see
 For I have sworn thee fair more perjurd I
 To swear against the truth so foul a lie

 CLIII

 Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
 A maid of Dians this advantage found
 And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep
 In a cold valleyfountain of that ground
 Which borrowd from this holy fire of Love
 A dateless lively heat still to endure
 And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
 Against strange maladies a sovereign cure
 But at my mistress eye Loves brand newfired
 The boy for trial needs would touch my breast
 I sick withal the help of bath desired
 And thither hied a sad distemperd guest
 But found no cure the bath for my help lies
 Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eyes

 CLIV

 The little Lovegod lying once asleep
 Laid by his side his heartinflaming brand
 Whilst many nymphs that vowd chaste life to keep
 Came tripping by but in her maiden hand
 The fairest votary took up that fire
 Which many legions of true hearts had warmd
 And so the general of hot desire
 Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmd
 This brand she quenched in a cool well by
 Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual
 Growing a bath and healthful remedy
 For men diseasd but I my mistress thrall
 Came there for cure and this by that I prove
 Loves fire heats water water cools not love

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
