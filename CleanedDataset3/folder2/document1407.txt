A MESSAGE FROM THE SEA


CHAPTER ITHE VILLAGE


And a mighty singlar and pretty place it is as ever I saw in all the
days of my life said Captain Jorgan looking up at it

Captain Jorgan had to look high to look at it for the village was built
sheer up the face of a steep and lofty cliff There was no road in it
there was no wheeled vehicle in it there was not a level yard in it
From the seabeach to the clifftop two irregular rows of white houses
placed opposite to one another and twisting here and there and there
and here rose like the sides of a long succession of stages of crooked
ladders and you climbed up the village or climbed down the village by
the staves between some six feet wide or so and made of sharp irregular
stones The old packsaddle long laid aside in most parts of England as
one of the appendages of its infancy flourished here intact Strings of
packhorses and packdonkeys toiled slowly up the staves of the ladders
bearing fish and coal and such other cargo as was unshipping at the
pier from the dancing fleet of village boats and from two or three
little coasting traders As the beasts of burden ascended laden or
descended light they got so lost at intervals in the floating clouds of
village smoke that they seemed to dive down some of the village
chimneys and come to the surface again far off high above others No
two houses in the village were alike in chimney size shape door
window gable rooftree anything The sides of the ladders were
musical with water running clear and bright The staves were musical
with the clattering feet of the packhorses and packdonkeys and the
voices of the fishermen urging them up mingled with the voices of the
fishermens wives and their many children The pier was musical with the
wash of the sea the creaking of capstans and windlasses and the airy
fluttering of little vanes and sails The rough seableached boulders
of which the pier was made and the whiter boulders of the shore were
brown with drying nets The redbrown cliffs richly wooded to their
extremest verge had their softened and beautiful forms reflected in the
bluest water under the clear North Devonshire sky of a November day
without a cloud The village itself was so steeped in autumnal foliage
from the houses lying on the pier to the topmost round of the topmost
ladder that one might have fancied it was out a birdsnesting and was
as indeed it was a wonderful climber And mentioning birds the place
was not without some music from them too for the rook was very busy on
the higher levels and the gull with his flapping wings was fishing in
the bay and the lusty little robin was hopping among the great stone
blocks and iron rings of the breakwater fearless in the faith of his
ancestors and the Children in the Wood

Thus it came to pass that Captain Jorgan sitting balancing himself on
the pierwall struck his leg with his open hand as some men do when
they are pleasedand as he always did when he was pleasedand said

A mighty singlar and pretty place it is as ever I saw in all the days
of my life

Captain Jorgan had not been through the village but had come down to the
pier by a winding sideroad to have a preliminary look at it from the
level of his own natural element He had seen many things and places
and had stowed them all away in a shrewd intellect and a vigorous memory
He was an American born was Captain Jorgana NewEnglanderbut he
was a citizen of the world and a combination of most of the best
qualities of most of its best countries

For Captain Jorgan to sit anywhere in his longskirted blue coat and blue
trousers without holding converse with everybody within speaking
distance was a sheer impossibility So the captain fell to talking with
the fishermen and to asking them knowing questions about the fishery
and the tides and the currents and the race of water off that point
yonder and what you kept in your eye and got into a line with what else
when you ran into the little harbour and other nautical profundities
Among the men who exchanged ideas with the captain was a young fellow
who exactly hit his fancya young fisherman of two or three and twenty
in the rough seadress of his craft with a brown face dark curling
hair and bright modest eyes under his Souwester hat and with a frank
but simple and retiring manner which the captain found uncommonly
taking Id bet a thousand dollars said the captain to himself that
your father was an honest man

Might you be married now asked the captain when he had had some talk
with this new acquaintance

Not yet

Going to be said the captain

I hope so

The captains keen glance followed the slightest possible turn of the
dark eye and the slightest possible tilt of the Souwester hat The
captain then slapped both his legs and said to himself

Never knew such a good thing in all my life Theres his sweetheart
looking over the wall

There was a very pretty girl looking over the wall from a little
platform of cottage vine and fuchsia and she certainly dig not look as
if the presence of this young fisherman in the landscape made it any the
less sunny and hopeful for her

Captain Jorgan having doubled himself up to laugh with that hearty good
nature which is quite exultant in the innocent happiness of other people
had undoubted himself and was going to start a new subject when there
appeared coming down the lower ladders of stones a man whom he hailed as
Tom Pettifer Ho Tom Pettifer Ho responded with alacrity and in
speedy course descended on the pier

Afraid of a sunstroke in England in November Tom that you wear your
tropical hat strongly paid outside and paperlined inside here said
the captain eyeing it

Its as well to be on the safe side sir replied Tom

Safe side repeated the captain laughing Youd guard against a sun
stroke with that old hat in an Ice Pack Waal What have you made
out at the Postoffice

It _is_ the Postoffice sir

Whats the Postoffice said the captain

The name sir The name keeps the Postoffice

A coincidence said the captain A lucky bit Show me where it is
Goodbye shipmates for the present I shall come and have another look
at you afore I leave this afternoon

This was addressed to all there but especially the young fisherman so
all there acknowledged it but especially the young fisherman _Hes_ a
sailor said one to another as they looked after the captain moving
away That he was and so outspeaking was the sailor in him that
although his dress had nothing nautical about it with the single
exception of its colour but was a suit of a shoregoing shape and form
too long in the sleeves and too short in the legs and too
unaccommodating everywhere terminating earthward in a pair of Wellington
boots and surmounted by a tall stiff hat which no mortal could have
worn at sea in any wind under heaven nevertheless a glimpse of his
sagacious weatherbeaten face or his strong brown hand would have
established the captains calling Whereas Mr Pettifera man of a
certain plump neatness with a curly whisker and elaborately nautical in
a jacket and shoes and all things correspondentlooked no more like a
seaman beside Captain Jorgan than he looked like a seaserpent

The two climbed high up the villagewhich had the most arbitrary turns
and twists in it so that the cobblers house came dead across the
ladder and to have held a reasonable course you must have gone through
his house and through him too as he sat at his work between two little
windowswith one eye microscopically on the geological formation of
that part of Devonshire and the other telescopically on the open
seathe two climbed high up the village and stopped before a quaint
little house on which was painted MRS RAYBROCK DRAPER and also
POSTOFFICE Before it ran a rill of murmuring water and access to
it was gained by a little plankbridge

Heres the name said Captain Jorgan sure enough You can come in if
you like Tom

The captain opened the door and passed into an odd little shop about
six feet high with a great variety of beams and bumps in the ceiling
and besides the principal window giving on the ladder of stones a
purblind little window of a single pane of glass peeping out of an
abutting corner at the sunlighted ocean and winking at its brightness

How do you do maam said the captain I am very glad to see you I
have come a long way to see you

_Have_ you sir Then I am sure I am very glad to see _you_ though I
dont know you from Adam

Thus a comely elderly woman short of stature plump of form sparkling
and dark of eye who perfectly clean and neat herself stood in the
midst of her perfectly clean and neat arrangements and surveyed Captain
Jorgan with smiling curiosity Ah but you are a sailor sir she
added almost immediately and with a slight movement of her hands that
was not very unlike wringing them then you are heartily welcome

Thankee maam said the captain I dont know what it is I am sure
that brings out the salt in me but everybody seems to see it on the
crown of my hat and the collar of my coat Yes maam I am in that way
of life

And the other gentleman too said Mrs Raybrock

Well now maam said the captain glancing shrewdly at the other
gentleman you are that nigh right that he goes to seaif that makes
him a sailor This is my steward maam Tom Pettifer hes been amost
all trades you could name in the course of his lifewould have bought
all your chairs and tables once if you had wished to sell embut now
hes my steward My names Jorgan and Im a shipowner and I sail my
own and my partners ships and have done so this fiveandtwenty year
According to custom I am called Captain Jorgan but I am no more a
captain bless your heart than you are

Perhaps youll come into my parlour sir and take a chair said Mrs
Raybrock

Exactly what I was going to propose myself maam After you

Thus replying and enjoining Tom to give an eye to the shop Captain
Jorgan followed Mrs Raybrock into the little low backroomdecorated
with divers plants in pots teatrays old china teapots and
punchbowlswhich was at once the private sittingroom of the Raybrock
family and the inner cabinet of the postoffice of the village of
Steepways

Now maam said the captain it dont signify a cent to you where I
was born except But here the shadow of some one entering fell upon
the captains figure and he broke off to double himself up slap both
his legs and ejaculate Never knew such a thing in all my life Here
he is again How are you

These words referred to the young fellow who had so taken Captain
Jorgans fancy down at the pier To make it all quite complete he came
in accompanied by the sweetheart whom the captain had detected looking
over the wall A prettier sweetheart the sun could not have shone upon
that shining day As she stood before the captain with her rosy lips
just parted in surprise her brown eyes a little wider open than was
usual from the same cause and her breathing a little quickened by the
ascent and possibly by some mysterious hurry and flurry at the parlour
door in which the captain had observed her face to be for a moment
totally eclipsed by the Souwester hat she looked so charming that the
captain felt himself under a moral obligation to slap both his legs
again She was very simply dressed with no other ornament than an
autumnal flower in her bosom She wore neither hat nor bonnet but
merely a scarf or kerchief folded squarely back over the head to keep
the sun offaccording to a fashion that may be sometimes seen in the
more genial parts of England as well as of Italy and which is probably
the first fashion of headdress that came into the world when grasses and
leaves went out

In my country said the captain rising to give her his chair and
dexterously sliding it close to another chair on which the young
fisherman must necessarily establish himselfin my country we should
call Devonshire beauty firstrate

Whenever a frank manner is offensive it is because it is strained or
feigned for there may be quite as much intolerable affectation in
plainness as in mincing nicety All that the captain said and did was
honestly according to his nature and his nature was open nature and good
nature therefore when he paid this little compliment and expressed
with a sparkle or two of his knowing eye I see how it is and nothing
could be better he had established a delicate confidence on that
subject with the family

I was saying to your worthy mother said the captain to the young man
after again introducing himself by name and occupationI was saying to
your mother and youre very like her that it didnt signify where I was
born except that I was raised on questionasking ground where the
babies as soon as ever they come into the world inquire of their
mothers Neow how old may _you_ be and waat air you a goin to name
mewhich is a fact Here he slapped his leg Such being the case
I may be excused for asking you if your names Alfred

Yes sir my name is Alfred returned the young man

I am not a conjurer pursued the captain and dont think me so or I
shall right soon undeceive you Likewise dont think if you please
though I _do_ come from that country of the babies that I am asking
questions for questionaskings sake for I am not Somebody belonging
to you went to sea

My elder brother Hugh returned the young man He said it in an
altered and lower voice and glanced at his mother who raised her hands
hurriedly and put them together across her black gown and looked
eagerly at the visitor

No For Gods sake dont think that said the captain in a solemn
way I bring no good tidings of him

There was a silence and the mother turned her face to the fire and put
her hand between it and her eyes The young fisherman slightly motioned
toward the window and the captain looking in that direction saw a
young widow sitting at a neighbouring window across a little garden
engaged in needlework with a young child sleeping on her bosom The
silence continued until the captain asked of Alfred

How long is it since it happened

He shipped for his last voyage better than three years ago

Ship struck upon some reef or rock as I take it said the captain
and all hands lost

Yes

Waal said the captain after a shorter silence Here I sit who may
come to the same end like enough He holds the seas in the hollow of
His hand We must all strike somewhere and go down Our comfort then
for ourselves and one another is to have done our duty Id wager your
brother did his

He did answered the young fisherman If ever man strove faithfully
on all occasions to do his duty my brother did My brother was not a
quick man anything but that but he was a faithful true and just man
We were the sons of only a small tradesman in this county sir yet our
father was as watchful of his good name as if he had been a king

A precious sight more so I hopebearing in mind the general run of
that class of crittur said the captain But I interrupt

My brother considered that our father left the good name to us to keep
clear and true

Your brother considered right said the captain and you couldnt take
care of a better legacy But again I interrupt

No for I have nothing more to say We know that Hugh lived well for
the good name and we feel certain that he died well for the good name
And now it has come into my keeping And thats all

Well spoken cried the captain Well spoken young man Concerning
the manner of your brothers deathby this time the captain had
released the hand he had shaken and sat with his own broad brown hands
spread out on his knees and spoke asideconcerning the manner of your
brothers death it may be that I have some information to give you
though it may not be for I am far from sure Can we have a little talk
alone

The young man rose but not before the captains quick eye had noticed
that on the pretty sweethearts turning to the window to greet the young
widow with a nod and a wave of the hand the young widow had held up to
her the needlework on which she was engaged with a patient and pleasant
smile So the captain said being on his legs

What might she be making now

What is Margaret making Kitty asked the young fishermanwith one of
his arms apparently mislaid somewhere

As Kitty only blushed in reply the captain doubled himself up as far as
he could standing and said with a slap of his leg

In my country we should call it weddingclothes Fact We should I do
assure you

But it seemed to strike the captain in another light too for his laugh
was not a long one and he added in quite a gentle tone

And its very pretty my dear to see herpoor young thing with her
fatherless child upon her bosomgiving up her thoughts to your home and
your happiness Its very pretty my dear and its very good May your
marriage be more prosperous than hers and be a comfort to her too May
the blessed sun see you all happy together in possession of the good
name long after I have done ploughing the great salt field that is never
sown

Kitty answered very earnestly O Thank you sir with all my heart
And in her loving little way kissed her hand to him and possibly by
implication to the young fisherman too as the latter held the parlour
door open for the captain to pass out




CHAPTER IITHE MONEY


The stairs are very narrow sir said Alfred Raybrock to Captain
Jorgan

Like my cabinstairs returned the captain on many a voyage

And they are rather inconvenient for the head

If my head cant take care of itself by this time after all the
knocking about the world it has had replied the captain as
unconcernedly as if he had no connection with it its not worth looking
after

Thus they came into the young fishermans bedroom which was as perfectly
neat and clean as the shop and parlour below though it was but a little
place with a sliding window and a phrenological ceiling expressive of
all the peculiarities of the houseroof Here the captain sat down on
the foot of the bed and glancing at a dreadful libel on Kitty which
ornamented the wallthe production of some wandering limner whom the
captain secretly admired as having studied portraiture from the figure
heads of shipsmotioned to the young man to take the rushchair on the
other side of the small round table That done the captain put his hand
in the deep breastpocket of his longskirted blue coat and took out of
it a strong square casebottlenot a large bottle but such as may be
seen in any ordinary ships medicinechest Setting this bottle on the
table without removing his hand from it Captain Jorgan then spake as
follows

In my last voyage homewardbound said the captain and thats the
voyage off of which I now come straight I encountered such weather off
the Horn as is not very often met with even there I have rounded that
stormy Cape pretty often and I believe I first beat about there in the
identical storms that blew the Devils horns and tail off and led to the
horns being worked up into toothpicks for the plantation overseers in my
country who may be seen if you travel down South or away West fur
enough picking their teeth with em while the whips made of the tail
flog hard In this last voyage homewardbound for Liverpool from South
America I say to you my young friend it blew Whole measures No
half measures nor making believe to blow it blew Now I warnt blown
clean out of the water into the skythough I expected to be even
thatbut I was blown clean out of my course and when at last it fell
calm it fell dead calm and a strong current set one way day and night
night and day and I drifteddrifteddriftedout of all the ordinary
tracks and courses of ships and drifted yet and yet drifted It
behooves a man who takes charge of fellowcritturs lives never to rest
from making himself master of his calling I never did rest and
consequently I knew pretty well specially looking over the side in the
dead calm of that strong current what dangers to expect and what
precautions to take against em In short we were driving head on to an
island There was no island in the chart and therefore you may say it
was illmanners in the island to be there I dont dispute its bad
breeding but there it was Thanks be to Heaven I was as ready for the
island as the island was ready for me I made it out myself from the
masthead and I got enough way upon her in good time to keep her off I
ordered a boat to be lowered and manned and went in that boat myself to
explore the island There was a reef outside it and floating in a
corner of the smooth water within the reef was a heap of seaweed and
entangled in that seaweed was this bottle

Here the captain took his hand from the bottle for a moment that the
young fisherman might direct a wondering glance at it and then replaced
his band and went on

If ever you comeor even if ever you dont cometo a desert place use
you your eyes and your spyglass well for the smallest thing you see may
prove of use to you and may have some information or some warning in it
Thats the principle on which I came to see this bottle I picked up the
bottle and ran the boat alongside the island and made fast and went
ashore armed with a part of my boats crew We found that every scrap
of vegetation on the island I give it you as my opinion but scant and
scrubby at the best of times had been consumed by fire As we were
making our way cautiously and toilsomely over the pulverised embers
one of my people sank into the earth breasthigh He turned pale and
Haul me out smart shipmates says he for my feet are among bones
We soon got him on his legs again and then we dug up the spot and we
found that the man was right and that his feet had been among bones
More than that they were human bones though whether the remains of one
man or of two or three men what with calcination and ashes and what
with a poor practical knowledge of anatomy I cant undertake to say We
examined the whole island and made out nothing else save and except
that from its opposite side I sighted a considerable tract of land
which land I was able to identify and according to the bearings of which
not to trouble you with my log I took a fresh departure When I got
aboard again I opened the bottle which was oilskincovered as you see
and glassstoppered as you see Inside of it pursued the captain
suiting his action to his words I found this little crumpled folded
paper just as you see Outside of it was written as you see these
words Whoever finds this is solemnly entreated by the dead to convey
it unread to Alfred Raybrock Steepways North Devon England A sacred
charge said the captain concluding his narrative and Alfred
Raybrock there it is

This is my poor brothers writing

I suppose so said Captain Jorgan Ill take a look out of this
little window while you read it

Pray no sir I should be hurt My brother couldnt know it would fall
into such hands as yours

The captain sat down again on the foot of the bed and the young man
opened the folded paper with a trembling hand and spread it on the
table The ragged paper evidently creased and torn both before and
after being written on was much blotted and stained and the ink had
faded and run and many words were wanting What the captain and the
young fisherman made out together after much rereading and much
humouring of the folds of the paper is given on the next page

The young fisherman had become more and more agitated as the writing had
become clearer to him He now left it lying before the captain over
whose shoulder he had been reading it and dropping into his former seat
leaned forward on the table and laid his face in his hands

What man urged the captain dont give in Be up and doing _like_ a
man

It is selfish I knowbut doing what doing what cried the young
fisherman in complete despair and stamping his seaboot on the ground

Doing what returned the captain Something Id go down to the
little breakwater below yonder and take a wrench at one of the
saltrusted iron rings there and either wrench it up by the roots or
wrench my teeth out of my head sooner than Id do nothing Nothing
ejaculated the captain Any fool or fainting heart can do _that_ and
nothing can come of nothingwhich was pretended to be found out I
believe by one of them Latin critters said the captain with the
deepest disdain as if Adam hadnt found it out afore ever he so much
as named the beasts

Yet the captain saw in spite of his bold words that there was some
greater reason than he yet understood for the young mans distress And
he eyed him with a sympathising curiosity

Come come continued the captain Speak out What is it boy

You have seen how beautiful she is sir said the young man looking up
for the moment with a flushed face and rumpled hair

Did any man ever say she warnt beautiful retorted the captain If
so go and lick him

The young man laughed fretfully in spite of himself and said

Its not that its not that

Waal then what is it said the captain in a more soothing tone

The young fisherman mournfully composed himself to tell the captain what
it was and began We were to have been married next Monday week

Were to have been interrupted Captain Jorgan And are to be Hey

Young Raybrock shook his head and traced out with his forefinger the
words _poor fathers five hundred pounds_ in the written paper

Go along said the captain Five hundred pounds Yes

That sum of money pursued the young fisherman entering with the
greatest earnestness on his demonstration while the captain eyed him
with equal earnestness was all my late father possessed When he died
he owed no man more than he left means to pay but he had been able to
lay by only five hundred pounds

Five hundred pounds repeated the captain Yes

In his lifetime years before he had expressly laid the money aside to
leave to my motherlike to settle upon her if I make myself
understood

Yes

He had risked it oncemy father put down in writing at that time
respecting the moneyand was resolved never to risk it again

Not a spectator said the captain My country wouldnt have suited
him Yes

My mother has never touched the money till now And now it was to have
been laid out this very next week in buying me a handsome share in our
neighbouring fishery here to settle me in life with Kitty

The captains face fell and he passed and repassed his sunbrowned right
hand over his thin hair in a discomfited manner

Kittys father has no more than enough to live on even in the sparing
way in which we live about here He is a kind of bailiff or steward of
manor rights here and they are not much and it is but a poor little
office He was better off once and Kitty must never marry to mere
drudgery and hard living

The captain still sat stroking his thin hair and looking at the young
fisherman

I am as certain that my father had no knowledge that any one was wronged
as to this money or that any restitution ought to be made as I am
certain that the sun now shines But after this solemn warning from my
brothers grave in the sea that the money is Stolen Money said Young
Raybrock forcing himself to the utterance of the words can I doubt it
Can I touch it

About not doubting I aint so sure observed the captain but about
not touchingnoI dont think you can

See then said Young Raybrock why I am so grieved Think of Kitty
Think what I have got to tell her

His heart quite failed him again when he had come round to that and he
once more beat his seaboot softly on the floor But not for long he
soon began again in a quietly resolute tone

However Enough of that You spoke some brave words to me just now
Captain Jorgan and they shall not be spoken in vain I have got to do
something What I have got to do before all other things is to trace
out the meaning of this paper for the sake of the Good Name that has no
one else to put it right And still for the sake of the Good Name and
my fathers memory not a word of this writing must be breathed to my
mother or to Kitty or to any human creature You agree in this

I dont know what theyll think of us below said the captain but for
certain I cant oppose it Now as to tracing How will you do

They both as by consent bent over the paper again and again carefully
puzzled out the whole of the writing

I make out that this would stand if all the writing was here Inquire
among the old men living there forsome one Most like youll go to
this village named here said the captain musing with his finger on
the name

Yes And Mr Tregarthen is a Cornishman andto be surecomes from
Lanrean

Does he said the captain quietly As I aint acquainted with him
who may _he_ be

Mr Tregarthen is Kittys father

Ay ay cried the captain Now you speak Tregarthen knows this
village of Lanrean then

Beyond all doubt he does I have often heard him mention it as being
his native place He knows it well

Stop half a moment said the captain We want a name here You could
ask Tregarthen or if you couldnt I could what names of old men he
remembers in his time in those diggings Hey

I can go straight to his cottage and ask him now

Take me with you said the captain rising in a solid way that had a
most comfortable reliability in it and just a word more first I have
knocked about harder than you and have got along further than you I
have had all my seagoing life long to keep my wits polished bright
with acid and friction like the brass cases of the ships instruments
Ill keep you company on this expedition Now you dont live by talking
any more than I do Clench that hand of yours in this hand of mine and
thats a speech on both sides

Captain Jorgan took command of the expedition with that hearty shake He
at once refolded the paper exactly as before replaced it in the bottle
put the stopper in put the oilskin over the stopper confided the whole
to Young Raybrocks keeping and led the way downstairs

But it was harder navigation belowstairs than above The instant they
set foot in the parlour the quick womanly eye detected that there was
something wrong Kitty exclaimed frightened as she ran to her lovers
side Alfred Whats the matter Mrs Raybrock cried out to the
captain Gracious what have you done to my son to change him like this
all in a minute And the young widowwho was there with her work upon
her armwas at first so agitated that she frightened the little girl she
held in her hand who hid her face in her mothers skirts and screamed
The captain conscious of being held responsible for this domestic
change contemplated it with quite a guilty expression of countenance
and looked to the young fisherman to come to his rescue

Kitty darling said Young Raybrock Kitty dearest love I must go
away to Lanrean and I dont know where else or how much further this
very day Worse than thatour marriage Kitty must be put off and I
dont know for how long

Kitty stared at him in doubt and wonder and in anger and pushed him
from her with her hand

Put off cried Mrs Raybrock The marriage put off And you going to
Lanrean Why in the name of the dear Lord

Mother dear I cant say why I must not say why It would be
dishonourable and undutiful to say why

Dishonourable and undutiful returned the dame And is there nothing
dishonourable or undutiful in the boys breaking the heart of his own
plighted love and his mothers heart too for the sake of the dark
secrets and counsels of a wicked stranger Why did you ever come here
she apostrophised the innocent captain Who wanted you Where did you
come from Why couldnt you rest in your own bad place wherever it is
instead of disturbing the peace of quiet unoffending folk like us

And what sobbed the poor little Kitty have I ever done to you you
hard and cruel captain that you should come and serve me so

And then they both began to weep most pitifully while the captain could
only look from the one to the other and lay hold of himself by the coat
collar

Margaret said the poor young fisherman on his knees at Kittys feet
while Kitty kept both her hands before her tearful face to shut out the
traitor from her viewbut kept her fingers wide asunder and looked at
him all the timeMargaret you have suffered so much so
uncomplainingly and are always so careful and considerate Do take my
part for poor Hughs sake

The quiet Margaret was not appealed to in vain I will Alfred she
returned and I do I wish this gentleman had never come near us
whereupon the captain laid hold of himself the tighter but I take your
part for all that I am sure you have some strong reason and some
sufficient reason for what you do strange as it is and even for not
saying why you do it strange as that is And Kitty darling you are
bound to think so more than any one for true love believes everything
and bears everything and trusts everything And mother dear you are
bound to think so too for you know you have been blest with good sons
whose word was always as good as their oath and who were brought up in
as true a sense of honour as any gentleman in this land And I am sure
you have no more call mother to doubt your living son than to doubt
your dead son and for the sake of the dear dead I stand up for the dear
living

Waal now the captain struck in with enthusiasm this I say That
whether your opinions flatter me or not you are a young woman of sense
and spirit and feeling and Id sooner have you by my side in the hour
of danger than a good half of the men Ive ever fallen in withor
fallen out with ayther

Margaret did not return the captains compliment or appear fully to
reciprocate his good opinion but she applied herself to the consolation
of Kitty and of Kittys motherinlaw that was to have been next Monday
week and soon restored the parlour to a quiet condition

Kitty my darling said the young fisherman I must go to your father
to entreat him still to trust me in spite of this wretched change and
mystery and to ask him for some directions concerning Lanrean Will you
come home Will you come with me Kitty

Kitty answered not a word but rose sobbing with the end of her simple
headdress at her eyes Captain Jorgan followed the lovers out quite
sheepishly pausing in the shop to give an instruction to Mr Pettifer

Here Tom said the captain in a low voice Heres something in your
line Heres an old lady poorly and low in her spirits Cheer her up a
bit Tom Cheer em all up

Mr Pettifer with a brisk nod of intelligence immediately assumed his
steward face and went with his quiet helpful steward step into the
parlour where the captain had the great satisfaction of seeing him
through the glass door take the child in his arms who offered no
objection and bend over Mrs Raybrock administering soft words of
consolation

Though what he finds to say unless hes telling her that tll soon be
over or that most people is so at first or that itll do her good
afterward I cannot imaginate was the captains reflection as he
followed the lovers

He had not far to follow them since it was but a short descent down the
stony ways to the cottage of Kittys father But short as the distance
was it was long enough to enable the captain to observe that he was fast
becoming the village Ogre for there was not a woman standing working at
her door or a fisherman coming up or going down who saw Young Raybrock
unhappy and little Kitty in tears but he or she instantly darted a
suspicious and indignant glance at the captain as the foreigner who must
somehow be responsible for this unusual spectacle Consequently when
they came into Tregarthens little gardenwhich formed the platform
from which the captain had seen Kitty peeping over the wallthe captain
brought to and stood off and on at the gate while Kitty hurried to hide
her tears in her own room and Alfred spoke with her father who was
working in the garden He was a rather infirm man but could scarcely be
called old yet with an agreeable face and a promising air of making the
best of things The conversation began on his side with great
cheerfulness and good humour but soon became distrustful and soon
angry That was the captains cue for striking both into the
conversation and the garden

Morning sir said Captain Jorgan How do you do

The gentleman I am going away with said the young fisherman to
Tregarthen

O returned Kittys father surveying the unfortunate captain with a
look of extreme disfavour I confess that I cant say I am glad to see
you

No said the captain and to admit the truth that seems to be the
general opinion in these parts But dont be hasty you may think better
of me byandby

I hope so observed Tregarthen

Waal _I_ hope so observed the captain quite at his ease more than
that I believe sothough you dont Now Mr Tregarthen you dont
want to exchange words of mistrust with me and if you did you couldnt
because I wouldnt You and I are old enough to know better than to
judge against experience from surfaces and appearances and if you
havent lived to find out the evil and injustice of such judgments you
are a lucky man

The other seemed to shrink under this remark and replied Sir I _have_
lived to feel it deeply

Waal said the captain mollified then Ive made a good cast without
knowing it Now Tregarthen there stands the lover of your only child
and here stand I who know his secret I warrant it a righteous secret
and none of his making though bound to be of his keeping I want to
help him out with it and tewwards that end we ask you to favour us with
the names of two or three old residents in the village of Lanrean As I
am taking out my pocketbook and pencil to put the names down I may as
well observe to you that this wrote atop of the first page here is my
name and address Silas Jonas Jorgan Salem Massachusetts United
States If ever you take it in your head to run over any morning I
shall be glad to welcome you Now what may be the spelling of these
said names

There was an elderly man said Tregarthen named David Polreath He
may be dead

Waal said the captain cheerfully if Polreaths dead and buried
and can be made of any service to us Polreath wont object to our
digging of him up Polreaths down anyhow

There was another named Penrewen I dont know his Christian name

Never mind his Chrisen name said the captain Penrewen for short

There was another named John Tredgear

And a pleasantsounding name too said the captain John Tredgears
booked

I can recall no other except old Parvis

One of old Parviss famly I reckon said the captain kept a
drygoods store in New York city and realised a handsome competency by
burning his house to ashes Same name anyhow David Polreath
Unchrisen Penrewen John Tredgear and old Arson Parvis

I cannot recall any others at the moment

Thankee said the captain And so Tregarthen hoping for your good
opinion yet and likewise for the fair Devonshire Flowers your
daughters I give you my hand sir and wish you good day

Young Raybrock accompanied him disconsolately for there was no Kitty at
the window when he looked up no Kitty in the garden when he shut the
gate no Kitty gazing after them along the stony ways when they begin to
climb back

Now I tell you what said the captain Not being at present
calculated to promote harmony in your family I wont come in You go
and get your dinner at home and Ill get mine at the little hotel Let
our hour of meeting be two oclock and youll find me smoking a cigar in
the sun afore the hotel door Tell Tom Pettifer my steward to consider
himself on duty and to look after your people till we come back youll
find hell have made himself useful to em already and will be quite
acceptable

All was done as Captain Jorgan directed Punctually at two oclock the
young fisherman appeared with his knapsack at his back and punctually at
two oclock the captain jerked away the last featherend of his cigar

Let me carry your baggage Captain Jorgan I can easily take it with
mine

Thankee said the captain Ill carry it myself Its only a comb

They climbed out of the village and paused among the trees and fern on
the summit of the hill above to take breath and to look down at the
beautiful sea Suddenly the captain gave his leg a resounding slap and
cried Never knew such a right thing in all my lifeand ran away

The cause of this abrupt retirement on the part of the captain was little
Kitty among the trees The captain went out of sight and waited and
kept out of sight and waited until it occurred to him to beguile the
time with another cigar He lighted it and smoked it out and still he
was out of sight and waiting He stole within sight at last and saw the
lovers with their arms entwined and their bent heads touching moving
slowly among the trees It was the golden time of the afternoon then
and the captain said to himself Golden sun golden sea golden sails
golden leaves golden love golden youtha golden state of things
altogether

Nevertheless the captain found it necessary to hail his young companion
before going out of sight again In a few moments more he came up and
they began their journey

That still young woman with the fatherless child said Captain Jorgan
as they fell into step didnt throw her words away but good honest
words are never thrown away And now that I am conveying you off from
that tender little thing that loves and relies and hopes I feel just
as if I was the snarling crittur in the picters with the tight legs the
long nose and the feather in his cap the tips of whose moustaches get
up nearer to his eyes the wickeder he gets

The young fisherman knew nothing of Mephistopheles but he smiled when
the captain stopped to double himself up and slap his leg and they went
along in right goodfellowship




CHAPTER V 1THE RESTITUTION


Captain Jorgan up and out betimes had put the whole village of Lanrean
under an amicable crossexamination and was returning to the King
Arthurs Arms to breakfast none the wiser for his trouble when he
beheld the young fisherman advancing to meet him accompanied by a
stranger A glance at this stranger assured the captain that he could be
no other than the Seafaring Man and the captain was about to hail him as
a fellowcraftsman when the two stood still and silent before the
captain and the captain stood still silent and wondering before them

Why whats this cried the captain when at last he broke the silence
You two are alike You two are much alike Whats this

Not a word was answered on the other side until after the seafaring
brother had got hold of the captains right hand and the fisherman
brother had got hold of the captains left hand and if ever the captain
had had his fill of handshaking from his birth to that hour he had it
then And presently up and spoke the two brothers one at a time two at
a time two dozen at a time for the bewilderment into which they plunged
the captain until he gradually had Hugh Raybrocks deliverance made
clear to him and also unravelled the fact that the person referred to in
the halfobliterated paper was Tregarthen himself

Formerly dear Captain Jorgan said Alfred of Lanrean you recollect
Kitty and her father came to live at Steepways after Hugh shipped on his
last voyage

Ay ay cried the captain fetching a breath _Now_ you have me in
tow Then your brother here dont know his sisterinlaw that is to be
so much as by name

Never saw her never heard of her

Ay ay ay cried the captain Why then we every one go back
togetherpaper writer and alland take Tregarthen into the secret we
kept from him

Surely said Alfred we cant help it now We must go through with
our duty

Not a doubt returned the captain Give me an arm apiece and let us
set this shipshape

So walking up and down in the shrill wind on the wild moor while the
neglected breakfast cooled within the captain and the brothers settled
their course of action

It was that they should all proceed by the quickest means they could
secure to Barnstaple and there look over the fathers books and papers
in the lawyers keeping as Hugh had proposed to himself to do if ever he
reached home That enlightened or unenlightened they should then
return to Steepways and go straight to Mr Tregarthen and tell him all
they knew and see what came of it and act accordingly Lastly that
when they got there they should enter the village with all precautions
against Hughs being recognised by any chance and that to the captain
should be consigned the task of preparing his wife and mother for his
restoration to this life

For you see quoth Captain Jorgan touching the last head it requires
caution any way great joys being as dangerous as great griefs if not
more dangerous as being more uncommon and therefore less provided
against in this round world of ours And besides I should like to free
my name with the ladies and take you home again at your brightest and
luckiest so dont lets throw away a chance of success

The captain was highly lauded by the brothers for his kind interest and
foresight

And now stop said the captain coming to a standstill and looking
from one brother to the other with quite a new rigging of wrinkles about
each eye you are of opinion to the elder that you are raather
slow

I assure you I am very slow said the honest Hugh

Waal replied the captain I assure you that to the best of my belief
I am raather smart Now a slow man aint good at quick business is
he

That was clear to both

You said the captain turning to the younger brother are a little in
love aint you

Not a little Captain Jorgan

Much or little youre sort preoccupied aint you

It was impossible to be denied

And a sort preoccupied man aint good at quick business is he said
the captain

Equally clear on all sides

Now said the captain I aint in love myself and Ive made many a
smart run across the ocean and I should like to carry on and go ahead
with this affair of yours and make a run slick through it Shall I try
Will you hand it over to me

They were both delighted to do so and thanked him heartily

Good said the captain taking out his watch This is halfpast eight
am Friday morning Ill jot that down and well compute how many
hours weve been out when we run into your mothers postoffice There
The entrys made and now we go ahead

They went ahead so well that before the Barnstaple lawyers office was
open next morning the captain was sitting whistling on the step of the
door waiting for the clerk to come down the street with his key and open
it But instead of the clerk there came the master with whom the
captain fraternised on the spot to an extent that utterly confounded him

As he personally knew both Hugh and Alfred there was no difficulty in
obtaining immediate access to such of the fathers papers as were in his
keeping These were chiefly old letters and cash accounts from which
the captain with a shrewdness and despatch that left the lawyer far
behind established with perfect clearness by noon the following
particulars

That one Lawrence Clissold had borrowed of the deceased at a time when
he was a thriving young tradesman in the town of Barnstaple the sum of
five hundred pounds That he had borrowed it on the written statement
that it was to be laid out in furtherance of a speculation which he
expected would raise him to independence he being at the time of
writing that letter no more than a clerk in the house of Dringworth
Brothers America Square London That the money was borrowed for a
stipulated period but that when the term was out the aforesaid
speculation failed and Clissold was without means of repayment That
hereupon he had written to his creditor in no very persuasive terms
vaguely requesting further time That the creditor had refused this
concession declaring that he could not afford delay That Clissold then
paid the debt accompanying the remittance of the money with an angry
letter describing it as having been advanced by a relative to save him
from ruin That in acknowlodging the receipt Raybrock had cautioned
Clissold to seek to borrow money of him no more as he would never so
risk money again

Before the lawyer the captain said never a word in reference to these
discoveries But when the papers had been put back in their box and he
and his two companions were well out of the office his right leg
suffered for it and he said

So far this runs begun with a fair wind and a prosperous for dont you
see that all this agrees with that dutiful trust in his father maintained
by the slow member of the Raybrock family

Whether the brothers had seen it before or no they saw it now Not that
the captain gave them much time to contemplate the state of things at
their ease for he instantly whipped them into a chaise again and bore
them off to Steepways Although the afternoon was but just beginning to
decline when they reached it and it was broad daylight still they had
no difficulty by dint of muffing the returned sailor up and ascending
the village rather than descending it in reaching Tregarthens cottage
unobserved Kitty was not visible and they surprised Tregarthen sitting
writing in the small baywindow of his little room

Sir said the captain instantly shaking hands with him pen and all
Im glad to see you sir How do you do sir I told you youd think
better of me byandby and I congratulate you on going to do it

Here the captains eye fell on Tom Pettifer Ho engaged in preparing some
cookery at the fire

That critter said the captain smiting his leg is a born steward
and never ought to have been in any other way of life Stop where you
are Tom and make yourself useful Now Tregarthen Im going to try a
chair

Accordingly the captain drew one close to him and went on

This loving member of the Raybrock family you know sir This slow
member of the same family you dont know sir Waal these two are
brothersfact Hughs come to life again and here he stands Now see
here my friend You dont want to be told that he was cast away but
you do want to be told for theres a purpose in it that he was cast
away with another man That man by name was Lawrence Clissold

At the mention of this name Tregarthen started and changed colour
Whats the matter said the captain

He was a fellowclerk of mine thirtyfiveandthirtyyears ago

True said the captain immediately catching at the clew Dringworth
Brothers America Square London City

The other started again nodded and said That was the house

Now pursued the captain between those two men cast away there arose
a mystery concerning the round sum of five hundred pound

Again Tregarthen started changing colour Again the captain said
Whats the matter

As Tregarthen only answered Please to go on the captain recounted
very tersely and plainly the nature of Clissolds wanderings on the
barren island as he had condensed them in his mind from the seafaring
man Tregarthen became greatly agitated during this recital and at
length exclaimed

Clissold was the man who ruined me I have suspected it for many a long
year and now I know it

And how said the captain drawing his chair still closer to
Tregarthen and clapping his hand upon his shoulderhow may you know
it

When we were fellowclerks replied Tregarthen in that London house
it was one of my duties to enter daily in a certain book an account of
the sums received that day by the firm and afterward paid into the
bankers One memorable daya Wednesday the black day of my
lifeamong the sums I so entered was one of five hundred pounds

I begin to make it out said the captain Yes

It was one of Clissolds duties to copy from this entry a memorandum of
the sums which the clerk employed to go to the bankers paid in there It
was my duty to hand the money to Clissold it was Clissolds to hand it
to the clerk with that memorandum of his writing On that Wednesday I
entered a sum of five hundred pounds received I handed that sum as I
handed the other sums in the days entry to Clissold I was absolutely
certain of it at the time I have been absolutely certain of it ever
since A sum of five hundred pounds was afterward found by the house to
have been that day wanting from the bag from Clissolds memorandum and
from the entries in my book Clissold being questioned stood upon his
perfect clearness in the matter and emphatically declared that he asked
no better than to be tested by Tregarthens book My book was
examined and the entry of five hundred pounds was not there

How not there said the captain when you made it yourself

Tregarthen continued

I was then questioned Had I made the entry Certainly I had The
house produced my book and it was not there I could not deny my book
I could not deny my writing I knew there must be forgery by some one
but the writing was wonderfully like mine and I could impeach no one if
the house could not I was required to pay the money back I did so
and I left the house almost brokenhearted rather than remain
thereeven if I could have done sowith a dark shadow of suspicion
always on me I returned to my native place Lanrean and remained
there clerk to a mine until I was appointed to my little post here

I well remember said the captain that I told you that if you had no
experience of ill judgments on deceiving appearances you were a lucky
man You went hurt at that and I see why Im sorry

Thus it is said Tregarthen Of my own innocence I have of course
been sure it has been at once my comfort and my trial Of Clissold I
have always had suspicions almost amounting to certainty but they have
never been confirmed until now For my daughters sake and for my own I
have carried this subject in my own heart as the only secret of my life
and have long believed that it would die with me

Waal my good sir said the captain cordially the present question
is and will be long I hope concerning living and not dying Now
here are our two honest friends the loving Raybrock and the slow Here
they stand agreed on one point on which Id back em round the world
and right across it from north to south and then again from east to
west and through it from your deepest Cornish mine to China It is
that they will never use this same sooftenmentioned sum of money and
that restitution of it must be made to you These two the loving member
and the slow for the sake of the right and of their fathers memory
will have it ready for you tomorrow Take it and ease their minds and
mine and end a most unfortunate transaction

Tregarthen took the captain by the hand and gave his hand to each of the
young men but positively and finally answered No He said they trusted
to his word and he was glad of it and at rest in his mind but there
was no proof and the money must remain as it was All were very earnest
over this and earnestness in men when they are right and true is so
impressive that Mr Pettifer deserted his cookery and looked on quite
moved

And so said the captain so we comeas that lawyercrittur over
yonder where we were this morning mightto mere proof do we We must
have it must we How From this Clissolds wanderings and from what
you say it aint hard to make out that there was a neat forgery of your
writing committed by the too smart rowdy that was grease and ashes when I
made his acquaintance and a substitution of a forged leaf in your book
for a real and torn leaf torn out Now was that real and true leaf then
and there destroyed Nofor says he in his drunken way he slipped it
into a crack in his own desk because you came into the office before
there was time to burn it and could never get back to it arterwards
Wait a bit Where is that desk now Do you consider it likely to be in
America Square London City

Tregarthen shook his head

The house has not for years transacted business in that place I have
heard of it and read of it as removed enlarged every way altered
Things alter so fast in these times

You think so returned the captain with compassion but you should
come over and see _me_ afore you talk about _that_ Waal now This
desk this paperthis paper this desk said the captain ruminating
and walking about and looking in his uneasy abstraction into Mr
Pettifers hat on a table among other things This desk this
paperthis paper this desk the captain continued musing and roaming
about the room Id give

However he gave nothing but took up his stewards hat instead and
stood looking into it as if he had just come into church After that he
roamed again and again said This desk belonging to this house of
Dringworth Brothers America Square London City

Mr Pettifer still strangely moved and now more moved than before cut
the captain off as he backed across the room and bespake him thus

Captain Jorgan I have been wishful to engage your attention but I
couldnt do it I am unwilling to interrupt Captain Jorgan but I must
do it _I_ knew something about that house

The captain stood stockstill and looked at himwith his Mr
Pettifers hat under his arm

Youre aware pursued his steward that I was once in the broking
business Captain Jorgan

I was aware said the captain that you had failed in that calling
and in half the businesses going Tom

Not quite so Captain Jorgan but I failed in the broking business I
was partners with my brother sir There was a sale of old office
furniture at Dringworth Brothers when the house was moved from America
Square and me and my brother made what we call in the trade a Deal
there sir And Ill make bold to say sir that the only thing I ever
had from my brother or from any relationfor my relations have mostly
taken property from me instead of giving me anywas an old desk we
bought at that same sale with a crack in it My brother wouldnt have
given me even that when we broke partnership if it had been worth
anything

Where is that desk now said the captain

Well Captain Jorgan replied the steward I couldnt say for certain
where it is now but when I saw it lastwhich was last time we were
outward boundit was at a very nice ladys at Wapping along with a
little chest of mine which was detained for a small matter of a bill
owing

The captain instead of paying that rapt attention to his steward which
was rendered by the other three persons present went to Church again in
respect of the stewards hat And a most especially agitated and
memorable face the captain produced from it after a short pause

Now Tom said the captain I spoke to you when we first came here
respecting your constitutional weakness on the subject of sunstroke

You did sir

Will my slow friend said the captain lend me his arm or I shall
sink right backards into this blessed stewards cookery Now Tom
pursued the captain when the required assistance was given on your
oath as a steward didnt you take that desk to pieces to make a better
one of it and put it together freshor something of the kind

On my oath I did sir replied the steward

And by the blessing of Heaven my friends one and all cried the
captain radiant with joyof the Heaven that put it into this Tom
Pettifers head to take so much care of his head against the bright
sunhe lined his hat with the original leaf in Tregarthens
writingand here it is

With that the captain to the utter destruction of Mr Pettifers
favourite hat produced the bookleaf very much worn but still legible
and gave both his legs such tremendous slaps that they were heard far off
in the bay and never accounted for

A quarter past five pm said the captain pulling out his watch and
thats thirtythree hours and a quarter in all and a pritty run

How they were all overpowered with delight and triumph how the money was
restored then and there to Tregarthen how Tregarthen then and there
gave it all to his daughter how the captain undertook to go to
Dringworth Brothers and reestablish the reputation of their forgotten
old clerk how Kitty came in and was nearly torn to pieces and the
marriage was reappointed needs not to be told Nor how she and the
young fisherman went home to the postoffice to prepare the way for the
captains coming by declaring him to be the mightiest of men who had
made all their fortunesand then dutifully withdrew together in order
that he might have the domestic coast entirely to himself How he
availed himself of it is all that remains to tell

Deeply delighted with his trust and putting his heart into it he raised
the latch of the postoffice parlour where Mrs Raybrock and the young
widow sat and said

May I come in

Sure you may Captain Jorgan replied the old lady And good reason
you have to be free of the house though you have not been too well used
in it by some who ought to have known better I ask your pardon

No you dont maam said the captain for I wont let you Waal to
be sure

By this time he had taken a chair on the hearth between them

Never felt such an evil spirit in the whole course of my life There I
tell you I could amost have cut my own connection Like the dealer in
my country away West who when he had let himself be outdone in a
bargain said to himself Now I tell you what Ill never speak to you
again And he never did but joined a settlement of oysters and
translated the multiplication table into their languagewhich is a fact
that can be proved If you doubt it mention it to any oyster you come
across and see if hell have the face to contradict it

He took the child from her mothers lap and set it on his knee

Not a bit afraid of me now you see Knows I am fond of small people I
have a child and shes a girl and I sing to her sometimes

What do you sing asked Margaret

Not a long song my dear

 Silas Jorgan
 Played the organ

Thats about all And sometimes I tell her storiesstories of sailors
supposed to be lost and recovered after all hope was abandoned Here
the captain musingly went back to his song

 Silas Jorgan
 Played the organ

repeating it with his eyes on the fire as he softly danced the child on
his knee For he felt that Margaret had stopped working

Yes said the captain still looking at the fire I make up stories
and tell em to that child Stories of shipwreck on desert islands and
long delay in getting back to civilised lauds It is to stories the like
of that mostly that

 Silas Jorgan
 Plays the organ

There was no light in the room but the light of the fire for the shades
of night were on the village and the stars had begun to peep out of the
sky one by one as the houses of the village peeped out from among the
foliage when the night departed The captain felt that Margarets eyes
were upon him and thought it discreetest to keep his own eyes on the
fire

Yes I make em up said the captain I make up stories of brothers
brought together by the good providence of GODof sons brought back to
mothers husbands brought back to wives fathers raised from the deep
for little children like herself

Margarets touch was on his arm and he could not choose but look round
now Next moment her hand moved imploringly to his breast and she was
on her knees before himsupporting the mother who was also kneeling

Whats the matter said the captain Whats the matter

 Silas Jorgan
 Played the

Their looks and tears were too much for him and he could not finish the
song short as it was

Mistress Margaret you have borne ill fortune well Could you bear good
fortune equally well if it was to come

I hope so I thankfully and humbly and earnestly hope so

Waal my dear said the captain prhaps it has come Hesdont be
frightenedshall I say the word

Alive

Yes

The thanks they fervently addressed to Heaven were again too much for the
captain who openly took out his handkerchief and dried his eyes

Hes no further off resumed the captain than my country Indeed
hes no further off than his own native country To tell you the truth
hes no further off than Falmouth Indeed I doubt if hes quite so fur
Indeed if you was sure you could bear it nicely and I was to do no more
than whistle for him

The captains trust was discharged A rush came and they were all
together again

This was a fine opportunity for Tom Pettifer to appear with a tumbler of
cold water and he presently appeared with it and administered it to the
ladies at the same time soothing them and composing their dresses
exactly as if they had been passengers crossing the Channel The extent
to which the captain slapped his legs when Mr Pettifer acquitted
himself of this act of stewardship could have been thoroughly
appreciated by no one but himself inasmuch as he must have slapped them
black and blue and they must have smarted tremendously

He couldnt stay for the wedding having a few appointments to keep at
the irreconcilable distance of about four thousand miles So next
morning all the village cheered him up to the level ground above and
there he shook hands with a complete Census of its population and
invited the whole without exception to come and stay several months
with him at Salem Mass US And there as he stood on the spot where
he had seen that little golden picture of love and parting and from
which he could that morning contemplate another golden picture with a
vista of golden years in it little Kitty put her arms around his neck
and kissed him on both his bronzed cheeks and laid her pretty face upon
his stormbeaten breast in sight of allashamed to have called such a
noble captain names And there the captain waved his hat over his head
three final times and there he was last seen going away accompanied by
Tom Pettifer Ho and carrying his hands in his pockets And there
before that ground was softened with the fallen leaves of three more
summers a rosy little boy took his first unsteady run to a fair young
mothers breast and the name of that infant fisherman was Jorgan
Raybrock

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergnetfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card
