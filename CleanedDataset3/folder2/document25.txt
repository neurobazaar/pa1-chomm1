firstorder administrative divisions are generally those approved by the
United States Board on Geographic Names BGN Changes that have been
reported but not yet acted upon by BGN are noted


__Area Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited
by international boundaries andor coastlines Land area is the
aggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries andor
coastlines excluding inland water bodies lakes reservoirs rivers
Comparative areas are based on total area equivalents Most entities
are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states The smaller
entities are compared with Washington DC 178 km2 69 miles2 or
The Mall in Washington DC 059 km2 023 miles2 146 acres


__Birth rate The average annual number of births during a year
per 1000 population at midyear Also known as crude birth rate

figures are estimates for 1 July 1991 with population growth rates
estimated for mid1991 through mid1992 Major political events have
been updated through 30 June 1991 Military age figures are average
annual estimates for 199195


__Death rate The average annual number of deaths during a year
per l000 population at midyear Also known as crude death rate


__Diplomatic representation The US Government has diplomatic
relations with 162 nations There are only 144 US embassies since some
nations have US ambassadors accredited to them but no physical US
mission exists The US has diplomatic relations with 151 of the 159 UN
membersthe exceptions are Angola Belorussia Byelorussia
constituent republic of the Soviet Union Cambodia Cuba Iran Vietnam
Ukraine constituent republic of the Soviet Union and obviously the US
itself In addition the US has diplomatic relations with 12 nations that

Soviet Union and continues to accredit the diplomatic representatives of
their last free governments


__Disputes This category includes a wide variety of situations
that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral
claims of one sort or another Every international land boundary
dispute in the Guide to International Boundaries a map published
by the Department of State is included References to other situations
may also be included that are border or frontierrelevant such as
maritime disputes geopolitical questions or irredentist issues
However inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance
or recognition by the US Government


__Economic aid This entry refers to bilateral commitments of

Official Development Assistance ODA which is defined as government
grants that a are administered with the promotion of economic
development and welfare of LDCs as their main objective and b are
concessional in character and contain a grant element of at least 25
and

Other Official Flows OOF or transactions by the official sector
whose main objective is other than developmentmotivated or whose
grant element is below the 25 threshold for ODA OOF transactions
include official export credits such as Eximbank credits official
equity and portfolio investment and debt reorganization by the
official sector that does not meet concessional terms

Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are
initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration
of intent

independent and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government Nation refers to a people politically organized into a
sovereign state with a definite territory Dependent area refers to a
broad category of political entities that are associated in some way
with a nation Names used for page headings are usually the shortform

__Gross domestic product GDP The value of all goods and
services produced domestically


__Gross national product GNP The value of all goods and
services produced domestically plus income earned abroad minus
income earned by foreigners from domestic production


__GNPGDP methodology In the Economy section GNPGDP dollar
estimates for the OECD countries the USSR and the East European
countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP
calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange
rates The PPP method normally involves the use of international
dollar price weights which are applied to the quantities of goods and
services produced in a given economy In addition to the lack of
reliable data from the majority of countries the statistician faces
a major difficulty in specifying identifying and allowing for the
quality of goods and services The division of a PPP GNPGDP estimate
in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives
the PPP conversion rate One thousand dollars will buy the
same market basket of goods in the US as one thousand dollars converted
to the local currency at the PPP conversion rate will buy in the other
country GNPGDP estimates for the LDCs on the other hand are based on
the conversion of GNPGDP estimates in local currencies to dollars at
the official currency exchange rates One caution the proportion of
say defense expenditures as a percent of GNPGDP in local currency
accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNPGDP
accounts are expressed in PPP terms as for example when an observer
estimates the dollar level of Soviet or Japanese military expenditures
similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under
currency exchange rate procedures Finally as academic research
moves forward on the PPP method we hope to convert all GNPGDP
estimates to this method in future editions of the Factbook


__Growth rate population The annual percent change in the
population resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over
deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country
The rate may be positive or negative

common definitionthe ability to read and write at a specified age
Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the
ability to read and write is beyond the scope of this publication


__Maps All maps will be available only in the printed version for
the foreseeable future


__Maritime claims The proximity of neighboring states may prevent
some national claims from being fully extended


__Merchant marine All ships engaged in the carriage of goods All
commercial vessels as opposed to all nonmilitary ships which
excludes tugs fishing vessels offshore oil rigs etc Also a
grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register

 Captive registerA register of ships maintained by a territory
possession or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships
owned in the parent country Also referred to as an offshore register
the offshore equivalent of an internal register Ships on a captive
register will fly the same flag as the parent country or a local
variant of it but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation
rules of the offshore territory Although the nature of a captive
register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent
country just as in the internal register the ships may also be owned
abroad The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register except that it is not the register of an independent state

 Flag of convenience registerA national register offering
registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state The major
flags of convenience FOC attract ships to their register by virtue
of low fees low or nonexistent taxation of profits and liberal
manning requirements True FOC registers are characterized by having
relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag
state Thus while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a
given set of circumstances an FOC register is one where the majority
of the merchant fleet is owned abroad It is also referred to as an
open register

 Flag stateThe nation in which a ship is registered and which
holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship whether at home
or abroad Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine
how a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreignowned ship may be
placed on the register

 Internal registerA register of ships maintained as a subset of
a national register Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits manning by
foreign nationals and usually ownership outside the flag state
when it functions as an FOC register The Norwegian International
Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most
notable examples of an internal register Both have been instrumental
in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in
attracting foreignowned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags

 Merchant shipA vessel that carries goods against payment of
freight Commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately
restricted to commercial vessels only

 RegisterThe record of a ships ownership and nationality as
listed with the maritime authorities of a country Also the
compendium of such individual ships registrations Registration of
a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws
of the country in which registered the flag state regardless of the
nationality of the ships ultimate owner


__Money figures All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars
unless otherwise indicated


__Net migration rate The balance between the number of persons
entering and leaving a country during the year per 1000 persons
based on midyear population An excess of persons entering the
country is referred to as net immigration 356 migrants1000
population an excess of persons leaving the country as net
emigration 926 migrants1000 population


__Population Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census
based on statistics from population censuses vital registration
systems or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on

__Economy
__Overview Fundamentally Afghanistan is an extremely poor
landlocked country highly dependent on farming wheat especially and
livestock raising sheep and goats Economic considerations however
have played second fiddle to political and military upheavals including
the nineyear Soviet military occupation ended 15 February 1989 and the
continuing bloody civil war Over the past decade onethird of the
population has fled the country with Pakistan sheltering about 33
million refugees and Iran about 13 million Another 1 million have
probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan Large
numbers of bridges buildings and factories have been destroyed or
damaged by military action or sabotage Government claims
to the contrary gross domestic product almost certainly is
lower than 10 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital
and the disruption of trade and transport

__Economy
__Overview As the poorest country in Europe Albanias development
lags behind even the least favored areas of the Yugoslav economy
For over 40 years the Stalinisttype economy has operated on the
principles of central planning and state ownership of the means of
production In recent years Albania has implemented limited economic
reforms to stimulate its lagging economy provide incentives and
decentralize decisionmaking In an effort to expand international
ties Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the Soviet
Union and the US The Albanians have also passed legislation allowing
foreign investment Albania possesses considerable mineral
resources and until 1990 was largely selfsufficient in food
several years of drought have hindered agricultural development
Numerical estimates of Albanian economic activity are subject to an
especially wide margin of error because the government until recently
did not release economic information

__Economy
__Overview The exploitation of oil and natural gas products forms
the backbone of the economy Algeria depends on hydrocarbons for nearly
all of its export receipts about 30 of government revenues and nearly
25 of GDP In 197374 the sharp increase in oil prices led to a booming
economy and helped to finance an ambitious program of industrialization
Plunging oil and gas prices combined with the mismanagement of Algerias
highly centralized economy have brought the nation to its most serious
social and economic crisis since independence The government has
promised farreaching reforms including giving publicsector companies
more autonomy encouraging privatesector activity boosting gas and
nonhydrocarbon exports and proposing a major overhaul of the banking
and financial systems but to date has made little progress

__Economy
__Overview The mainstay of Andorras economy is tourism An
estimated 12 million tourists visit annually attracted by Andorras
dutyfree status and by its summer and winter resorts Agricultural
production is limited by a scarcity of arable land and most food has to
be imported The principal livestock activity is sheep raising
Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes cigars and furniture The
rapid pace of European economic integration is a potential threat to
Andorras advantages from its dutyfree status

resources notably gold diamonds and arable land To realize its
economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace but also

__Economy
__Overview Bangladesh is one of the poorest nations in the world
The economy is based on the output of a narrow range of
agricultural products such as jute which is the main cash crop and
major source of export earnings Bangladesh is hampered by a relative
lack of natural resources population growth of more than 2 a year
largescale unemployment and a limited infrastructure furthermore
it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters Despite these constraints
real GDP growth averaged about 35 annually during 198589 A strong
agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth rate up to 55
Alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the governments
development strategy

__Economy
__Overview The Bolivian economy steadily deteriorated between
1980 and 1985 as La Paz financed growing budget deficits by expanding
the money supply and inflation spiraledpeaking at 11700 An austere
orthodox economic program adopted by newly elected President Paz
Estenssoro in 1985 however succeeded in reducing inflation to between
10 and 20 annually since 1987 eventually restarting economic growth
President Paz Zamora has retained the economic policies of the previous
government keeping inflation down and continuing the moderate growth
begun under his predecessor Nevertheless Bolivia continues to be one of
the poorest countries in Latin America and it remains vulnerable to
price fluctuations for its limited exportsagricultural products
minerals and natural gas Moreover for many farmers who constitute
half of the countrys work force the main cash crop is coca which is
sold for cocaine processing

__Economy
__Overview The economy has historically been based on cattle raising
and crops Agriculture today provides a livelihood for over 80 of the
population but produces only about 50 of food needs and contributes
a small 3 to GDP The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of
the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry This sector mostly on
the strength of diamonds has gone from generating 25 of GDP in 1980 to
over 50 in 1989 No other sector has experienced such growth especially
not agriculture which is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils The
unemployment rate remains a problem at 25

__Economy
__Overview The economy with large agrarian mining and
manufacturing sectors entered the 1990s with declining real growth
runaway inflation an unserviceable foreign debt of 122 billion and
a lack of policy direction In addition the economy remained highly
regulated inwardlooking and protected by substantial trade and
investment barriers Ownership of major industrial and mining facilities
is divided among private interestsincluding several multinationalsand
the government Most large agricultural holdings are private with the
government channeling financing to this sector Conflicts between large
landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent violence
The government is seeking an IMF standby loan despite several failed
agreements over the past decade Relations with foreign commercial
banks remain strained because of mounting interest arrears on Brazils
longterm debt The Collor government which assumed office in March
1990 is embarked on an ambitious reform program that seeks to
modernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices
deregulating the economy and opening it to increased foreign
competition A major longrun strength is Brazils vast natural
resources

__Economy
__Overview Growth in the lackluster Bulgarian economy fell to the
2 annual level in the 1980s By 1990 Sofias foreign debt had
skyrocketed to over 10 billiongiving a debt service ratio of more
than 40 of hard currency earnings and leading the regime to declare
a moratorium on its hard currency payments The postZhivkov regime
faces major problems of renovating an aging industrial plant
coping with worsening energy food and consumer goods shortages
keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments
investing in additional energy capacity the portion of electric
power from nuclear energy reached over onethird in 1990 and
motivating workers in part by giving them a share in the earnings of
their enterprises A major decree of January 1989 summarized and
extended the governments economic restructuring efforts which include
a partial decentralization of controls over production decisions and
foreign trade In October 1990 the Lukanov government proposed an
economic reform program based on a US Chamber of Commerce study It was
never instituted because of a political stalemate between the BSP and the
UDF The new Popov government launched a similar reform program in
January 1991 but full implementation has been slowed by continuing
political disputes

__Economy
__Overview Burma is a poor Asian country with a per capita GDP
of about 400 The nation has been unable to achieve any substantial
improvement in export earnings because of falling prices for many
of its major commodity exports For rice traditionally the most
important export the drop in world prices has been accompanied by
shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales In 1985 teak replaced
rice as the largest export and continues to hold this position The
economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector which generates
about half of GDP and provides employment for 66 of the work force

__Economy
__Overview Cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic
development has been stymied by deadly political infighting The
economy is based on agriculture and related industries Over the
past decade Cambodia has been slowly recovering from its near destruction
by war and political upheaval It still remains however one of the
worlds poorest countries with an estimated per capita GDP of about
130 The food situation is precarious during the 1980s famine has
been averted only through international relief In 1986 the production
level of rice the staple food crop was able to meet only 80 of
domestic needs The biggest success of the nations recovery program has
been in new rubber plantings and in fishing Industry other than rice
processing is almost nonexistent Foreign trade is primarily with the
USSR and Vietnam Statistical data on the economy continues to be sparse
and unreliable Foreign aid from the USSR and Eastern Europe almost
certainly is being slashed

__Economy
__Overview Over the past decade the economy has registered a
remarkable performance because of the development of an offshore oil
industry Real GDP growth annually averaged 10 from 1978 to 1985 In
1986 Cameroon had one of the highest levels of income per capita in
tropical Africa with oil revenues picking up the slack as growth in
other sectors softened Because of the sharp drop in oil prices however
the economy experienced serious budgetary difficulties and
balanceofpayments disequilibrium Despite the recent upsurge in oil
prices Cameroons economic outlook is troubled Oil reserves currently
being exploited will be depleted in the early 1990s so ways must be
found to boost agricultural and industrial exports in the medium term
The Sixth Cameroon Development Plan 198691 stresses balanced
development and designates agriculture as the basis of the countrys
economic future

its great natural resources skilled labor force and modern capital

__Economy
__Overview In 1990 economic growth slowed from an average of 62
for the previous six years to about 15 as a result of tight monetary
policy aimed at reducing inflation Monetary policy was not
successful at slowing price increases until the end of the year
however and inflation stimulated by higher world oil prices
increased to 273 in 1990 from 214 in 1989 Copper prices held strong
in 1990 helping to maintain a balanceofpayments surplus and increase
international reserves Most observers expect that inflationary
pressures have run their course and price increases will slow during
1991 contributing to growth of 45

__Economy
__Overview Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been
trying to move the economy from the sluggish Sovietstyle centrally
planned economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market
elementsbut still within the framework of monolithic Communist control
To this end the authorities have switched to a system of household
responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization
increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in
industry permitted a wide variety of smallscale enterprise in services
and light manufacturing and opened the foreign economic sector to
increased trade and joint ventures The most gratifying result has been a
strong spurt in production particularly in agriculture in the early
1980s Otherwise the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid
system the worst results of socialism bureaucracy lassitude
corruption and of capitalism windfall gains and steppedup inflation
Beijing thus has periodically backtracked retightening central controls
at intervals and thereby undermining the credibility of the reform
process Popular resistance and changes in central policy have
weakened Chinas population control program which is essential to the
nations longterm economic viability

__Economy
__Overview One of the worlds poorest countries Comoros is made
up of several islands that have poor transportation links a young and
rapidly increasing population and few natural resources The low
educational level of the labor force contributes to a low level of
economic activity high unemployment and a heavy dependence on foreign
grants and technical assistance Agriculture including fishing and
forestry is the leading sector of the economy It contributes about 40
to GDP employs 80 of the labor force and provides most of the exports
The country is not selfsufficient in food production and rice the main
staple accounts for 90 of imports During the period 198286 the
industrial sector grew at an annual average rate of 53 but its
contribution to GDP was only 5 in 1988 Despite major investment in the
tourist industry which accounts for about 25 of GDP growth has
stagnated since 1983 A sluggish growth rate of 15 during 198590 has
led to large budget deficits declining incomes and balanceofpayments
difficulties

__Overview Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the
economy providing about twothirds of government revenues and

to finance largescale development projects with growth averaging 5

oil prices however has forced the government to launch an austerity
program to cope with declining receipts and mounting foreign debts

Gains in agricultural production on the strength of good coffee and

__Economy
__Overview The economy centrally planned and largely state owned
is highly dependent on the agricultural sector and foreign trade Sugar
provides about 75 of export revenues and over half is exported to the
USSR The economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies that have
deemphasized material incentives in the workplace abolished farmers
informal produce markets and raised prices of governmentsupplied goods
and services In 1990 the economy probably fell 3 largely as a result
of declining trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe Recently
the government has been trying to increase trade with Latin America and
China Cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since 1982 The
government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist
facilities Other investment priorities include sugar basic foods and
nickel The annual 4 billion Soviet subsidy a main prop to Cubas
threadbare economy is likely to show a substantial decline over the
next few years in view of the USSRs mounting economic problems Instead
of highly subsidized trade Cuba will be shifting to trade at market
prices in convertible currencies In early 1991 the shortages of fuels
spare parts and industrial products in general had become so severe as
to amount to a deindustrialization process in the eyes of some observers

__Economy
__Overview The economy is largely dependent on trade imported
components average 60 of the value of goods consumed in the domestic
market Rapid growth of free trade zones has established a significant
expansion of manufacturing for export especially wearing apparel
Over the past decade tourism has also increased in importance and is a
major earner of foreign exchange and a source of new jobs Agriculture
remains a key sector of the economy The principal commercial crop is
sugarcane followed by coffee cotton cocoa and tobacco Domestic
industry is based on the processing of agricultural products durable
consumer goods minerals and chemicals Unemployment is officially
reported at about 30 but there is considerable underemployment An
increasing foreign debt burden and galloping inflation are the economys
greatest weaknesses

__Economy
__Overview Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all
the Third World economies most industrial plants being owned by the
government Overregulation holds back technical modernization and
foreign investment Even so the economy grew rapidly during the late
1970s and early 1980s but in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices
and an increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin
negotiations with the IMF for balanceofpayments support As part of
the 1987 agreement with the IMF the government agreed to institute
a reform program to reduce inflation promote economic growth and
improve its external position The reforms have been slow in coming
however and the economy has been largely stagnant for the past
three years The addition of 1 million people every seven months
to Egypts population exerts enormous pressure on the 5 of the total
land area available for agriculture

__Economy
__Overview The economy is based on sheep farming which directly or
indirectly employs most of the work force A few dairy herds are kept to
meet domestic consumption of milk and milk products and crops grown are
primarily those for providing winter fodder Exports feature shipments
of highgrade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins
Rich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited
by the islanders So far efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry
have been unsuccessful In 1987 the government began selling
fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falklands
exclusive fishing zone These license fees amount to more than 40
million per year and are a primary source of income for the
government To encourage tourism the Falkland Islands Development
Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the
abundant wildlife and trout fishing

now must cope with the decline of the allimportant fishing
industry and with an external debt twice the size of annual
income When the nations of the world extended their fishing
zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s the Faroese
no longer could continue their traditional longdistance fishing
and subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas one
estimate foresaw a 25 drop in fish catch in 1990 alone Half the
fishing fleet is for sale and the 22 fishprocessing plants work
at only half capacity The government no longer can maintain its
high level of spending on roads and tunnels hospitals sports
facilities and other social welfare programs

__Economy
__Overview Fijis economy is primarily agricultural with a large
subsistence sector Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange
and sugar processing accounts for onethird of industrial output
Industry including sugar milling contributes 13 to GDP Fiji
traditionally had earned considerable sums of hard currency from the
250000 tourists who visited each year In 1987 however after two
military coups the economy went into decline GDP dropped by 78 in
1987 and by another 25 in 1988 political uncertainty created a drop in
tourism and the worst drought of the century caused sugar production
to fall sharply In contrast sugar and tourism turned in strong
performances in 1989 and the economy rebounded vigorously In 1990
the economy received a setback from cyclone Sina which cut sugar
output by an estimated 21

__Economy
__Overview Finland has a highly industrialized largely free market
economy with per capita output nearly threefourths the US figure
Its main economic force is the manufacturing sectorprincipally
the wood metals and engineering industries Trade is important with
the export of goods representing about 30 of GDP Except for timber and
several minerals Finland depends on imported raw materials energy and
some components of manufactured goods Because of the climate
agricultural development is limited to maintaining selfsufficiency in
basic commodities The economy which experienced an average of 49
annual growth between 1987 and 1989 leveled off in 1990 and is now
in a recession facing negative growth in 1991 The clearing account
system between Finland and the Soviet Union in the postwar periodmainly
Soviet oil and gas for Finnish manufactured goodshad kept Finland
isolated from world recessions the system however was dismantled on
1 January 1991 in favor of hard currency trade As a result Finland must
increase its competitiveness in certain sectors for example textiles
foodstuffs paper and metals and has already begun to shift trade
westward Finland as a member of EFTA is negotiating a European
Economic Area arrangement with the EC which would allow for free
movement of capital goods services and labor within the organization

__Economy
__Overview One of the worlds most developed economies France
has substantial agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern
industrial sector Large tracts of fertile land the application of
modern technology and subsidies have combined to make it the leading
agricultural producer in Western Europe France is largely
selfsufficient in agricultural products and is a major exporter of
wheat and dairy products The industrial sector generates about
onequarter of GDP and the growing services sector has become crucial
to the economy After sluggish growth during the period 198287 the
economy expanded at a rapid 38 pace in 198889 The economy
slowed down in 1990 with growth of 20 expected in 1991
The economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new
entrants into the labor force resulting in a high unemployment rate
which probably will rise to around 10 during the slowdown
The steadily advancing economic integration within the European
Community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic
sectors

__Economy
__Overview The economy dependent on timber and manganese until
the early 1970s is now dominated by the oil sector During the period
198185 oil accounted for about 46 of GDP 83 of export earnings and
65 of government revenues on average The high oil prices of the early
1980s contributed to a substantial increase in per capita income
stimulated domestic demand reinforced migration from rural to urban
areas and raised the level of real wages to among the highest in
SubSaharan Africa The threeyear slide of Gabons economy which
began with falling oil prices in 1985 was reversed in 1989 because of a
near doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows In 1990 the economy
continued to grow but debt servicing problems are hindering economic
advancement The agricultural and industrial sectors are relatively
underdeveloped except for oil

__Note The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967
ended with Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the
Sinai and the Golan Heights As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords
and reaffirmed by President Reagans 1 September 1982 peace initiative
the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship
with their neighbors and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to
be negotiated among the concerned parties Camp David further specifies
that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries Pending
the completion of this process it is US policy that the final status of
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined In the view of
the US the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the Jordan
under Jordanian administration before the 1967 ArabIsraeli war With
respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement however it
is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the
rest of the West Bank because of the citys special status and
circumstances Therefore a negotiated solution for the final status of
Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the
West Bank

__Economy
__Overview The newly unified German economy presents a starkly
contrasting picture Western Germany has an advanced market economy
and is a leading exporter It experienced fasterthanprojected real
growth largely because of demand in eastern Germany for western German
goods Western Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population
which enjoys excellent living standards abundant leisure time and
comprehensive social welfare benefits Western Germany is relatively
poor in natural resources coal being the most important mineral
Western Germanys worldclass companies manufacture technologically
advanced goods The regions economy is mature manufacturing and service
industries account for the dominant share of economic activity and raw
materials and semimanufactured products constitute a large proportion of
imports In 1989 manufacturing accounted for 31 of GDP with other
sectors contributing lesser amounts In recent years gross fixed
investment has accounted for about 21 of GDP In 1990 GDP in the western
region was an estimated 16300 per capita

 In contrast eastern Germanys obsolete command economy once
dominated by smokestack heavy industries has been undergoing a
wrenching change to a market economy Industrial production in early
1991 is down 50 from the same period last year due largely to the
slump in domestic demand for eastern Germanmade goods and the ongoing
economic restructuring The FRGs legal social welfare and economic
systems have been extended to the east but economic
restructuringprivatizing industry establishing clear property rights
clarifying responsibility for environmental cleanup and removing
Communistera holdovers from managementis proceeding slowly
so far deterring outside investors The region is one of the worlds
largest producers of lowgrade lignite coal but has few other resources
The quality of statistics from eastern Germany remains poor Bonn is
still trying to bring statistics for the region in line with West German
practices

 The most challenging economic problem of a united Germany is the
reconstruction of eastern Germanys economyspecifically finding the
right mix of fiscal regulatory monetary and tax policies that
will spur investment in the east without derailing western Germanys
healthy economy or damaging relations with Western partners The
biggest danger is that soaring unemployment in eastern Germany which
could climb to the 30 to 40 range could touch off labor disputes
or renewed mass relocation to western Germany and erode investor
confidence in eastern Germany Overall economic activity grew an
estimated 46 in western Germany in 1990 while dropping roughly 15 in
eastern Germany Per capita GDP in the eastern region was approximately
8700 in 1990

__Economy
__Overview Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic
entrepreneurial system overlaid in 198189 by a socialist government
that enlarged the public sector from 55 of GDP in 1981 to about 70
when Prime Minister Mitsotakis took office Mitsotakis inherited several
severe economic problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker
governments which neglected the runaway budget deficit a ballooning
current account deficit and accelerating inflation With only a
twoseat majority in the Chamber of Deputies Mitsotakis has concentrated
on cutting the publicsector payroll cautiously expanding the tax base
and adopting guidelines for privatizing Greeces lossridden stateowned
enterprises Once the political situation is sorted out Greece will have
to face the challenges posed by the steadily increasing integration of
the European Community including the progressive lowering of trade and
investment barriers Tourism continues as a major industry providing a
vital offset to the sizable commodity trade deficit

__Economy
__Overview Over the past 25 years the economy has changed from
one based on subsistence whaling hunting and fishing to one dependent
on foreign trade Fishing is still the most important industry
accounting for over 75 of exports and about 25 of the
populations income Maintenance of a social welfare system similar to
Denmarks has given the public sector a dominant role in the economy
In 1990 the economy became critically dependent on shrimp exports and an
annual subsidy now about 355 million from the Danish Government
because cod exports had fallen the zinc and lead mine closed and
a large promising platinum and gold mine was not yet operational
Greenland has signed a contract for its largest construction project
a power plant to supply the capital To avoid a decline in the economy
Denmark has agreed to pay 75 of the costs of running Sondrestrom
Airbase and Kulusuk Airfield as civilian bases after the US withdraws

__Economy
__Overview After growing on average at less than 1 a year in
198687 GDP dropped by 3 a year in 198889 The decline resulted from
bad weather labor trouble in the canefields and flooding and equipment
problems in the bauxite industry Consumer prices rose about 35 in 1988
and by over 100 in 1989 and the current account deficit widened
substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell Moreover electric
power is in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains
in national output The government in association with international
financial agencies seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new
funds The governments stabilization programaimed at establishing
realistic exchange rates reasonable price stability and a resumption of
growthrequires considerable public administrative abilities and
continued patience by consumers during a long incubation period

__Economy
__Overview Agriculture is an important sector providing sizable
export earnings and meeting domestic food needs Industry accounts for
about 40 of GNP and 30 of employment About 40 of Hungarys foreign
trade is with the USSR and Eastern Europe and a third is with the EC
Low rates of growth reflect the inability of the Sovietstyle economy to
modernize capital plant and motivate workers GNP declined by 1 in 1989
and by an estimated 6 in 1990 Since 1985 external debt has more than
doubled to over 20 billion In recent years Hungary has experimented
widely with decentralized and marketoriented enterprises The newly
democratic government has renounced the Soviet economic growth model and
plans to open the economy to wider market forces and to much closer
economic relations with Western Europe Prime Minister Antall has
declared his intention to move foward on privatization of state
enterprises provision for bankruptcy land reform and marketization of
international trade but concerns over acceptable levels of unemployment
and inflation may slow the reform process

__Economy
__Overview Icelands prosperous Scandinaviantype economy is
basically capitalistic but with extensive welfare measures low
unemployment and comparatively even distribution of income The economy
is heavily dependent on the fishing industry which provides nearly 75
of export earnings In the absence of other natural resources Icelands
economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices As a result of
climbing fish prices in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement
Iceland is pulling out of a recession which began in mid1988 with a
sharp decline in fish prices and an imposition of quotas on fish catches
to conserve stocks Inflation was down sharply from 20 in 1989
to 8 in 1990

__Economy
__Overview Indias economy is a mixture of traditional
village farming and handicrafts modern agriculture old and new branches
of industry and a multitude of support services It presents both the
entrepreneurial skills and drives of the capitalist system and
widespread government intervention of the socialist mold Growth of 4
to 5 annually in the 1980s has softened the impact of population growth
on unemployment social tranquility and the environment Agricultural
output has continued to expand reflecting the greater use of modern
farming techniques and improved seed that have helped to make India
selfsufficient in food grains and a net agricultural exporter However
tens of millions of villagers particularly in the south have not
benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty Industry
has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls The growth rate
of the service sector has also been strong India however has been
challenged more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves higher
inflation and a large debt service burden

an important sector accounting for 21 of GDP and over 50 of the labor
force The staple crop is rice Once the worlds largest rice importer
Indonesia is now nearly selfsufficient Plantation cropsrubber and

__Economy
__Overview Since the 1979 revolution the banks petroleum industry
transportation utilities and mining have been nationalized but the
new fiveyear planthe first since the revolutionpassed in January
1990 calls for the transfer of many governmentcontrolled enterprises
to the private sector Disruptions from the bitter war with Iraq
massive corruption mismanagement demographic pressures and ideological
rigidities have kept economic growth at depressed levels Oil accounts
for over 90 of export revenues A combination of war damage and low oil
prices brought a 2 drop in GNP in 1988 GNP probably rose slightly in
1989 considerably short of the 32 population growth rate in 1989
Heating oil and gasoline are rationed Agriculture has suffered from the
war land reform and shortages of equipment and materials The fiveyear
plan seeks to reinvigorate the economy by increasing the role of the
private sector boosting nonoil income and securing foreign loans The
plan is overly ambitious but probably will generate some shortterm
relief

__Economy
__Overview The Bathist regime engages in extensive central
planning and management of industrial production and foreign trade while
leaving some smallscale industry and services and most agriculture to
private enterprise The economy has been dominated by the oil sector
which has provided about 95 of foreign exchange earnings In the 1980s
financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the eightyear
war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran led the
government to implement austerity measures and to borrow heavily and
later reschedule foreign debt payments After the end of hostilities in
1988 oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new
pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities Agricultural development
remained hampered by labor shortages salinization and dislocations
caused by previous land reform and collectivization programs The
industrial sector although accorded high priority by the government
also was under financial constraints Iraqs seizure of Kuwait in August
1990 subsequent international economic embargoes and military actions
by an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically
changed the economic picture Oil exports were cut to near zero
and industrial and transportation facilities severely damaged

__Economy
__Overview Israel has a market economy with substantial government
participation It depends on imports for crude oil food grains raw
materials and military equipment Despite limited natural resources
Israel has developed its agricultural and industrial sectors on an
intensive scale over the past 20 years Industry accounts for about 23
of the labor force agriculture for 5 and services for most of the
balance Diamonds hightechnology machinery and agricultural products
fruits and vegetables are the biggest export earners The balance of
payments has traditionally been negative but is offset by large transfer
payments and foreign loans About half of Israels 18 billion external
government debt is owed to the US which is its major source for economic
and military aid To earn needed foreign exchange Israel must continue
to exploit hightechnology niches in the international market such as
medical scanning equipment Iraqs invasion of Kuwait on 2 August dealt
a blow to Israels economy in 1990 Higher world oil prices added an
estimated 300 million to Israels 1990 oil import bill and helped
keep the inflation rate at 18 for the year Regional tensions
and continuing acts of the Palestinian uprising
intifadahrelated violence contributed to a sharp dropoff in
tourisma key source of foreign exchangeto the lowest level since the
1973 ArabIsraeli war In 1991 the influx of up to 400000 Soviet
immigrants will increase unemployment intensify the countrys
housing crisis and contribute to a widening budget deficit

__Economy
__Overview Since World War II the economy has changed from one based
on agriculture into a ranking industrial economy with approximately the
same total and per capita output as France and the UK The country is
still divided into a developed industrial north dominated by small
private companies and an undeveloped agricultural south dominated by
large public enterprises Services account for 48 of GDP industry 34
agriculture 4 and public administration 13 Most raw materials needed
by industry and over 75 of energy requirements must be imported The
economic recovery that began in mid1983 has continued through 1990 with
the economy growing at an annual average rate of 3 For the 1990s Italy
faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering communications system
curbing pollution in major industrial centers and adjusting to the new
competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic integration of the
European Community

__Economy
__Overview Ivory Coast is among the worlds largest producers
and exporters of coffee cocoa beans and palmkernel oil Consequently

agriculture and related industries The agricultural sector accounts for
over onethird of GDP and about 80 of export earnings and employs about
85 of the labor force A collapse of world cocoa and coffee prices in
1986 threw the economy into a recession from which the country had not
recovered by 1990

__Economy
__Overview The economy is based on sugar bauxite and tourism
In 1985 it suffered a setback with the closure of some facilities in the
bauxite and alumina industry a major source of hard currency earnings
Since 1986 an economic recovery has been under way In 1987 conditions
began to improve for the bauxite and alumina industry because of
increases in world metal prices The recovery has also been supported by
growth in the manufacturing and tourism sectors In September 1988
Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on crops and the electric power
system a sharp but temporary setback to the economy By October 1989 the
economic recovery from the hurricane was largely complete and real growth
was up about 3 for 1989 In 1990 35 economic growth was led by
mining and tourism

__Economy
__Overview Although Japan has few natural resources since 1971 it
has become the worlds thirdlargest economy ranking behind only the
US and the USSR Governmentindustry cooperation a strong work ethic
and a comparatively small defense allocation have helped Japan advance
rapidly notably in hightechnology fields Industry the most important
sector of the economy is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
fuels Selfsufficent in rice Japan must import 50 of its requirements
for other grain and fodder crops Japan maintains one of the worlds
largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15 of the global
catch Overall economic growth has been spectacular a 10 average in the
1960s a 5 average in the 1970s and 1980s In 1990 strong investment and
consumption spending helped maintain growth at 56 Inflation remains
low at 31 despite higher oil prices and rising wages because of a
tight labor market Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus 52
billion in 1990 which supports extensive investment in foreign
properties

__Economy
__Overview Jordan was a secondary beneficiary of the oil boom of
the late 1970s and early 1980s when its annual GNP growth averaged
1012 Recent years however have witnessed a sharp reduction in grant
aid from Arab oilproducing countries and a dropoff in worker
remittances with national growth averaging 12 Importsmainly oil
capital goods consumer durables and foodstuffshave been outstripping
exports by roughly 2 billion annually the difference being made up by
aid remittances and borrowing In mid1989 the Jordanian Government
agreed to implement an IMF austerity program designed to tackle the
countrys serious economic problems The program sought to gradually
reduce the governments budget deficit over the next several years and
implement badly needed structural reforms in the economy In return for
agreeing to the IMF program Jordan was granted IMF standby loans of over
100 million Recognizing that it would be unable to cover its debt
obligations the government also began debt rescheduling negotiations
with creditors in mid1989 The onset of the Gulf crisis in August 1990
forced the government to shelve the IMF program and suspend most debt
payments and rescheduling negotiations Economic prospects for 1991
are especially gloomy given the unsettled conditions in the Middle
East

viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at the time of independence
in 1979 Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports
The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years Real GDP declined
about 8 in 1987 as the fish catch fell sharply to only onefourth the
level of 1986 and copra production was hampered by repeated rains Output
rebounded strongly in 1988 with real GDP growing by 17 The upturn in
economic growth came from an increase in copra production and a good fish
catch Following the strong surge in output in 1988 GNP increased 1

agricultural land is collectivized and stateowned industry produces 95
of manufactured goods State control of economic affairs is unusually
tight even for a Communist country because of the small size and
homogeneity of the society and the strict oneman rule of Kim Economic
growth during the period 198490 averaged approximately 3 Abundant
natural resources and hydropower form the basis of industrial
development Output of the extractive industries includes coal iron ore
magnesite graphite copper zinc lead and precious metals
Manufacturing emphasis is centered on heavy industry with light industry
lagging far behind Despite the use of highyielding seed varieties
expansion of irrigation and the heavy use of fertilizers North Korea
has not yet become selfsufficient in food production Four consecutive
years of poor harvests coupled with distribution problems have led to
chronic food shortages North Korea remains far behind South Korea in
economic development and living standards

__Overview Up to the invasion by Iraq in August 1990 the oil
sector had dominated the economy Kuwait has the thirdlargest
oil reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia and Iraq Earnings from
hydrocarbons generated over 90 of both export and government revenues
and contributed about 40 to GDP Most of the nonoil sector has
traditionally been dependent upon oilderived government revenues
Iraqs destruction of Kuwaits oil industry during the Gulf war
has devastated the economy Iraq destroyed or damaged more than 80
of Kuwaits 950 operating oil wells as well as sabotaging key surface
facilities Western firefighters had brought about 140 of the 600
oil well fires and blowouts under control as of early June 1991

__Government
__Note Between early 1975 and late 1976 Lebanon was torn by civil
war between its Christiansthen aided by Syrian troopsand its Muslims
and their Palestinian allies The ceasefire established in October
1976 between the domestic political groups generally held for about six
years despite occasional fighting Syrian troops constituted as the Arab
Deterrent Force by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon Syrias
move toward supporting the Lebanese Muslims and the Palestinians and
Israels growing support for Lebanese Christians brought the two sides
into rough equilibrium but no progress was made toward national
reconciliation or political reformsthe original cause of the war


 Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian presence in
Lebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 Israeli
forces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and mounted a
summerlong siege of Beirut which resulted in the evacuation of the
PLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational
force MNF made up of US French and Italian troops


 Within days of the departure of the MNF Lebanons newly elected
president Bashir Gemayel was assassinated In the wake of his death
Christian militiamen massacred hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two
Beirut camps This prompted the return of the MNF to ease the security
burden on Lebanons weak Army and security forces In late March 1984
the last MNF units withdrew


 Lebanese Parliamentarians met in Taif Saudi Arabia in late 1989
and concluded a national reconciliation pact that codified a new
powersharing formula specifiying a Christian president but giving
Muslims more authority Rene Muawad was subsequently elected president on
4 November 1989 ending a 13month period during which Lebanon had no
president and rival Muslim and Christian governments Muawad was
assassinated 17 days later on 22 November on 24 November Ilyas Harawi
was elected to succeed Muawad


 In October 1990 the chances for ending the 16 year old civil war
and implementing Taif were markedly improved when Syrian and Lebanese
forces ousted renegade Christian General Awn from his stronghold in East
Beirut Awn had defied the legitimate government and established a
separate ministate within East Beirut after being appointed acting
Prime Minister by outgoing President Gemayel in 1988 Awn and his
supporters feared Taif would diminish Christian power in Lebanon
and increase the influence of Syria


 Since the removal of Awn the Lebanese Government has reunited the
capital city and implemented a phased plan to disarm the militias
and gradually reestablish authority throughout Lebanon The army has
deployed from Beirut north along the coast road to Tripoli southeast
into the Shuf mountains and south to the vicinity of Sidon Many
militiamen from Christian and Muslim groups have evacuated Beirut
for their strongholds in the north south and east of the country
Some heavy weapons possessed by the militias have been turned over to
the government which has begun a plan to integrate some militiamen
into the military and the internal security forces


 Lebanon and Syria signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation in
May 1991 Lebanon continues to be partially occupied by Syrian troops
which are deployed in East and West Beirut its southern suburbs
the Bekaa Valley and throughout northern Lebanon


 Iran also maintains a small contingent of revolutionary guards
in the Bekaa Valley and South Lebanon to support Lebanese Islamic
fundamentalist groups


 Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in 1985
although it still retains troops in a 10kmdeep security zone north
of its border with Lebanon Israel arms and trains the Army of South
Lebanon ASL which also occupies the security zone and is Israels
first line of defense against attacks on its northern border

__Economy
__Overview Since 1975 civil war has seriously damaged Lebanons
economic infrastructure disrupted economic activity and all but ended
Lebanons position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub
Following October 1990 however a tentative peace has enabled the
central government to begin restoring control in Beirut collect taxes
and regain access to key port and government facilities The battered
economy has also been propped up by a financially sound banking system
and resilient small and mediumscale manufacturers Family remittances
foreign financial support to political factions the narcotics trade and
international emergency aid are main sources of foreign exchange
Economic prospects for 1991 have brightened particularly if the
Syrianbacked government is able to maintain law and order and
reestablish business confidence Rebuilding warravaged Beirut is likely
to provide a major stimulus to the Lebanese economy in 1991

economy especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia Expatriate
businessmen fled the country taking capital and expertise with them
Many will not return Richly endowed with water mineral resources
forests and a climate favorable to agriculture Liberia had been a
producer and exporter of basic products while local manufacturing
mainly foreign owned had been small in scope Political instability
threatens prospects for economic reconstruction and repatriation of

__Economy
__Overview The socialistoriented economy depends primarily upon
revenues from the oil sector which contributes practically all export
earnings and about onethird of GNP Since 1980 however the sharp
drop in oil prices and the resulting decline in export revenues have
adversely affected economic development In 1988 per capita GNP was the
highest in Africa at 5410 but it had been 2000 higher in 1982
Severe cutbacks in imports over the past five years have led to shortages
of basic goods and foodstuffs although the reopening of the
LibyanTunisian border in April 1988 and the LibyanEgyptian border in
December 1989 have somewhat eased shortages Austerity budgets and a lack
of trained technicians have undermined the governments ability to
implement a number of planned infrastructure development projects
Windfall profits from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved
the foreign payments position and may permit Tripoli to ease austerity
measures The nonoil industrial and construction sectors which account
for about 22 of GDP have expanded from processing mostly agricultural
products to include petrochemicals iron steel and aluminum Although
agriculture accounts for less than 5 of GNP it employs 18 of the labor
force Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output
requiring Libya to import about 75 of its food requirements

__Economy
__Overview The economy is based on sugarcane bananas tourism and
light industry Agriculture accounts for about 12 of GDP and the small
industrial sector for 10 Sugar production has declined with most of
the sugarcane now used for the production of rum Banana exports are
increasing going mostly to France The bulk of meat vegetable and
grain requirements must be imported contributing to a chronic trade
deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from France Tourism
has become more important than agricultural exports as a source of
foreign exchange The majority of the work force is employed in the
service sector and in administration In 1986 per capita GDP was
relatively high at 6000 During 1986 the unemployment rate was 30 and

__Economy
__Overview A majority of the population still depends on agriculture
and livestock for a livelihood even though most of the nomads and many
subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in
the 1970s and 1980s Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore that
account for almost 50 of total exports The decline in world demand for
this ore however has led to cutbacks in production The nations
coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world but
overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of revenue The
countrys first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in 1986 In recent
years the droughts the conflict with Senegal rising energy costs
and economic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of
foreign debt The government now has begun the second stage of an
economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank the IMF
and major donor countries

__Economy
__Overview Mexicos economy is a mixture of stateowned industrial
plants notably oil private manufacturing and services and both
largescale and traditional agriculture In the 1980s Mexico experienced
severe economic difficulties the nation accumulated large external debts
as world petroleum prices fell rapid population growth outstripped the
domestic food supply and inflation unemployment and pressures to
emigrate became more acute Growth in national output however
appears to be recovering rising from 14 in 1988 to 39 in 1990
The US is Mexicos major trading partner accounting for twothirds of
its exports and imports After petroleum border assembly plants and
tourism are the largest earners of foreign exchange The government in
consultation with international economic agencies is implementing
programs to stabilize the economy and foster growth In 1991 the
government also plans to begin negotiations with the US and Canada on a
free trade agreement

In addition Micronesia earns about 4 million a year in fees from foreign

subsistence farming and fishing The islands have few mineral deposits
worth exploiting except for highgrade phosphate The potential for a
tourist industry exists but the remoteness of the location and a lack of

__Economy
__Overview One of Africas poorest countries with a per capita GDP
of little more than 100 Mozambique has failed to exploit the economic
potential of its sizable agricultural hydropower and transportation
resources Indeed national output consumption and investment declined
throughout the first half of the 1980s because of internal disorders
lack of government administrative control and a growing foreign debt
A sharp increase in foreign aid attracted by an economic reform policy
has resulted in successive years of economic growth since 1985
Agricultural output nevertheless is at about only 75 of its 1981
level and grain has to be imported Industry operates at only 2040 of
capacity The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep
afloat

of which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000 Phosphates have
given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third

most necessities must be imported including fresh water from
Australia The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income
from phosphates constitute serious longterm problems Substantial

transition

__Economy
__Overview Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries
in the world with a per capita income of less than 200 Real growth
averaged 4 in the 1980s until FY89 when it plunged to 15 because of
a tradetransit dispute with India Though the impasse is over
political turmoil and inflated energy costs will probably constrain
growth to under 4 Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy
providing a livelihood for over 90 of the population and
accounting for 60 of GDP Industrial activity is limited mainly
involving the processing of agricultural produce jute sugarcane
tobacco and grain Production of textiles and carpets has expanded
recently and accounted for 87 of foreign exchange earnings in FY89
Apart from agricultural land and forests the only other exploitable
natural resources are mica hydropower and tourism Agricultural
production in the late 1980s grew by about 5 compared
with a population growth of 26 Forty percent or more of the
population is undernourished partly because of poor distribution
Economic prospects for the 1990s are poor with economic growth
probably outpacing population growth only slightly

agrarian economy dependent on a guaranteed British market to an open
free market economy that can compete on the global scene The government
has hoped that dynamic growth would boost real incomes reduce
inflationary pressures and permit the expansion of welfare benefits The
results have been mixed inflation is down from doubledigit levels
but growth has been sluggish and unemployment always a highly sensitive
issue has been at a record high 74 In 1988 GDP fell by 1 in

__Economy
__Overview Government control of the economy historically has been
extensive although the Chamorro government has pledged to reduce it
The financial system is directly controlled by the state which also
regulates wholesale purchasing production sales foreign trade and
distribution of most goods Over 50 of the agricultural and industrial
firms are state owned Sandinista economic policies and the war
have produced a severe economic crisis The foundation of the economy
continues to be the export of agricultural commodities largely coffee
and cotton Farm production fell by roughly 7 in 1989 the fifth
successive year of decline The agricultural sector employs 44
of the work force and accounts for 23 of GDP and 86 of export earnings
Industry which employs 13 of the work force and contributes about
25 to GDP showed a drop of 7 in 1989 and remains below
pre1979 levels External debt is one of the highest in the world on a
per capita basis In 1990 the annual inflation rate was 11800 sharply

__Economy
__Overview About 90 of the population is engaged in farming and
stock rearing activities which generate almost half the national
income The economy also depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium
deposits Uranium production grew rapidly in the mid1970s but tapered
off in the early 1980s when world prices declined France is a major
customer while Germany Japan and Spain also make regular purchases
The depressed demand for uranium has contributed to an overall
sluggishness in the economy a severe trade imbalance and a mounting
external debt

country it remains poor with a 280 per capita GDP In 1990 despite
rising oil prices and a sharp drop in inflation performance remained
slack with continuing underutilization of industrial capacity and a
second year of relatively weak agricultural performance Agricultural
production was up only 42 in 1990 still below the 1987 level
Industrial output showed a 72 increase but remained below the 1985
level Government efforts to reduce Nigerias dependence on oil exports
and to sustain noninflationary growth have fallen short due to inadequate
new investment funds Living standards continue to deteriorate from the
higher level of the early 1980s oil boom

__Climate the western Pacific is monsoonala rainy season occurs
during the summer months when moistureladen winds blow from the ocean
over the land and a dry season during the winter months when dry winds
blow from the Asian land mass back to the ocean


__Terrain surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise
warm water gyre broad circular system of currents and in the southern
Pacific by a counterclockwise cool water gyre sea ice occurs in the
Bering Sea and
Sea of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from

cyclones typhoons in southeast and east Asia from May to December most
frequent from July to October tropical cyclones hurricanes may form
south of Mexico and strike Central America and Mexico from June to
October most common in August and September southern shipping lanes
subject to icebergs from Antarctica occasional El Nino phenomenon
occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade winds slacken and the warm
Equatorial Countercurrent moves south which kills the plankton that is
the primary food source for anchovies consequently the anchovies move
to better feeding grounds causing resident marine birds to starve by the
thousands because of their lost food source

Canal Luzon Strait and the Singapore Strait the Equator divides the
Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean
ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme north from October to
May and in extreme south from May to October persistent fog in the
northern Pacific from June to December is a hazard to shipping
surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and earthquake activity
sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire


__Economy
__Overview The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world
economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch
It provides cheap sea transportation between East and West extensive
fishing grounds offshore oil and gas fields minerals and sand and
gravel for the construction industry In 1985 over half 54 of the
worlds total fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean which is the only
ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978
Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an
everincreasing role in the energy supplies of Australia New Zealand
China US and Peru The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas
combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985 has
slowed but not stopped new drillings

__Economy
__Overview Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the
usual problems of rapidly increasing population sizable government
deficits and heavy dependence on foreign aid In addition the economy
must support a large military establishment and provide for the needs of
4 million Afghan refugees A real economic growth rate averaging 56 in
recent years has enabled the country to cope with these problems Almost
all agriculture and smallscale industry is in private hands and the
government seeks to privatize a portion of the largescale industrial
enterprises now publicly owned In December 1988 Pakistan signed a
threeyear economic reform agreement with the IMF which provides for a
reduction in the government deficit and a liberalization of trade in
return for further IMF financial support Late in 1990 the IMF
suspended assistance to Pakistan because the government failed to
follow through on deficit reforms Pakistan almost certainly will make
little headway on raising living standards for its rapidly expanding
population at the current rate of growth population would double in
29 years

__Economy
__Overview The economy is predominantly agricultural Agriculture
including forestry accounts for about 25 of GNP employs about 45 of
the labor force and provides the bulk of exports Paraguay has no known
significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
hydropower potential Since 1981 economic performance has declined
compared with the boom period of 197681 when real GDP grew at an
average annual rate of nearly 11 During 198286 real GDP fell in three
of five years inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32 and
foreign debt rose Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the
economy were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam bad weather
for crops and weak international commodity prices for agricultural
exports In 1987 the economy experienced a minor recovery because of
improved weather conditions and stronger international prices for key
agricultural exports The recovery continued through 1990 on the
strength of bumper crops in 198889 The government however must
follow through on promises of reforms needed to deal with escalating
inflation large fiscal deficits growing debt arrearages and falling
reserves

__Economy
__Overview The Peruvian economy is basically capitalistic with a
large dose of government welfare programs and government management of
credit In the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation
declining per capita output and mounting external debt Peru was shut
off from IMF and World Bank support in the mid1980s because of its
huge debt arrears An austerity program implemented shortly after the
Fujimori government took office in July 1990 contributed to a third
consecutive yearly contraction of economic activity but was able to
generate a small recovery in the last quarter After a burst of
inflation as the program eliminated government price subsidies monthly
price increases eased to the singledigit level for the first time
since mid1988 Lima has restarted current payments to multilateral
lenders and although it faces 14 billion in arrears on its external
debt is working toward an accommodation with its creditors

__Economy
__Overview The economy except for the agricultural sector had
followed the Soviet model of state ownership and control of
productive assets About 75 of agricultural production had come from the
private sector and the rest from state farms The economy has presented a
picture of moderate but slowing growth against a background of underlying
weaknesses in technology and worker motivation GNP dropped by 20 in
1989 and by a further 89 in 1990 The inflation rate after falling
sharply from the 1982 peak of 100 to 22 in 1986 rose to a galloping
rate of 640 in 1989 and dropped back to 250 in 1990 Shortages of
consumer goods and some food items worsened in 198889 Agricultural
products and coal are among the biggest hard currency earners but
manufactures are increasing in importance Poland with its hard currency
debt of 485 billion is severely limited in its ability to import
muchneeded hard currency goods The sweeping political changes of 1989
disrupted normal economic channels and exacerbated shortages In January
1990 the new Solidarityled government adopted a cold turkey program for
transforming Poland to a market economy The government moved to
eliminate subsidies free prices make the zloty convertible and
in general halt the hyperinflation These financial measures were
accompanied by plans to privatize the economy in stages While inflation
fell to an annual rate of 775 by November of 1990 the rise in
unemployment and the drop in living standards have led to growing popular
discontent and to a change of government in January 1991 The new
government is continuing the previous governments economic
program while trying to speed privatization and to better cushion the
populace from the dislocations associated with reform Substantial
outside aid will be needed if Poland is to make a successful transition
in the 1990s

__Economy
__Overview Industry which accounts for onethird of the labor force
and generates over half the GNP suffers from an aging capital plant and
persistent shortages of energy The year 1990 witnessed about a 20
drop in industrial production because of energy and input shortages and
labor unrest In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend
with drought mismanagement and shortages of inputs A drought in 1990
contributed to a lackluster harvest a problem compounded by corruption
and a poor distribution system The new government is slowly loosening
the tight central controls of Ceausescus command economy It has
instituted moderate land reforms with close to onehalf of cropland now
in private hands and it has allowed changes in prices for private
agricultural output Also the new regime is permitting the
establishment of private enterprises largely in services handicrafts
and smallscale industry New laws providing for the privatization
of large state firms have been passed However most of the early
privatization will involve converting state firms into jointstock
companies The selling of shares to the public has not yet been worked
out Furthermore the government has halted the old policy of diverting
food from domestic consumption to hard currency export markets So far
the government does not seem willing to adopt a thoroughgoing market
system that is there is great caution in decontrolling prices because
of public opposition The government has sharply raised price ceilings
instead of lifting them entirely

__Economy
__Overview Almost 50 of GDP comes from the agricultural sector
coffee and tea make up 8090 of total exports The amount of fertile
land is limited however and deforestation and soil erosion have created
problems The industrial sector in Rwanda is small contributing only
16 to GDP Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of
agricultural products The Rwandan economy remains dependent on coffee
exports and foreign aid with no relief in sight Weak international
prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita
GDP to decline A structural adjustment program with the World Bank
began in October 1990 An outbreak of insurgency also in October has
dampened any prospects for economic improvement

__Economy
__Overview The inhabitants have traditionally earned their
livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the
coast of Newfoundland The economy has been declining however because
the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over
the years In March 1989 an agreement between France and Canada set fish
quotas for Saint Pierres trawlers fishing in Canadian and
Canadianclaimed waters for three years The agreement settles a
longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish exports to a halt
The islands are heavily subsidized by France Imports come primarily from
Canada and France

__Economy
__Overview The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the
country gained independence nearly 15 years ago Since then however
cocoa production has gradually deteriorated because of drought and
mismanagement so that by 1987 output had fallen to less than 50 of
its former levels As a result a shortage of cocoa for export has
created a serious balanceofpayments problem Production of less
important crops such as coffee copra and palm kernels has
also declined The value of imports generally exceeds that of
exports by a ratio of 4 to 1 The emphasis on cocoa production at
the expense of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import
90 of food needs It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured
goods Over the years Sao Tome has been unable to service its external
debt which amounts to roughly 80 of export earnings Considerable
potential exists for development of a tourist industry and the
government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years The
government also implemented a FiveYear Plan covering 198690 to
restructure the economy and reschedule external debt service payments in
cooperation with the International Development Association and Western
lenders

__Economy
__Overview Many of the white oneseventh of the South African
population enjoy incomes material comforts and health and educational
standards equal to those of Western Europe In contrast most of the
remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third
World including unemployment lack of job skills and barriers to
movement into higherpaying fields Inputs and outputs thus do not move
smoothly into the most productive employments and the effectiveness
of the market is further lowered by international constraints on
dealings with South Africa The main strength of the economy lies in
its rich mineral resources which provide twothirds of exports
Average growth of less than 2 in output in recent years falls far short
of the 56 level needed to cut into the high unemployment rate

__Economy
__Overview The first six years of perestroyka economic and
political restructuring have undermined the institutions and processes
of the Soviet command economy without replacing them with efficiently
functioning markets The initial reforms have featured greater authority
for enterprise managers over prices wages product mix investment
sources of supply and customers But in the absence of effective market
discipline the result has been the disappearance of lowprice goods
excessive wage increases an even larger volume of unfinished
construction projects and in general continued economic stagnation
The Gorbachev regime has made at least four serious errors in economic
policy in these six years the unpopular and shortlived antialcohol
campaign the initial cutback in imports of consumer goods the failure
to act decisively at the beginning for the privatization of agriculture
and the buildup of a massive overhang of unspent rubles in the hands of
households and enterprises The regime has vacillated among a series of
ambitious economic policy prescriptions put forth by leading economists
and political leaders The plans vary from proposals for a quick
marketization of the economy b gradual marketization c a period
of retrenchment to ensure a stable base for future marketization and
d a return to disciplined central planning and allocation The
economy caught between two systems is suffering from even greater
mismatches between what is being produced and what would serve the best
interests of enterprises and households Meanwhile the seething
nationality problems have been dislocating regional patterns of economic
specialization and pose a further major threat to growth prospects over
the next few years Official Soviet statistics report GNP fell by 2 in
1990 but the actual decline was substantially greater Whatever the
numerical decline it does not capture the increasing disjointures in the
economy evidenced by emptier shelves longer lines increased barter and
widespread strikes


__GNP approximately 2660 billion per capita 9130
real growth rate  24 to  50 1990 est based on a reconstruction
of official Soviet statistics notebecause of the continued
unraveling of Soviet economic and statistical controls the estimate
is subject to even greater uncertainties than in earlier years the
dollar estimates most likely overstate Soviet GNP to some extent because
of an incomplete allowance for the poor quality narrow assortment and
low performance characteristics of Soviet goods and services the
 24 growth figure is based on the application of CIAs usual
estimating methods whereas the  50 figure is corrected for
measurement problems that worsened sharply in 1990


__Inflation rate consumer prices 14 1990 est


__Unemployment rate official Soviet statistics imply an unemployment
rate of 1 to 2 percent in 1990 USSRs first official unemployment
estimate however is acknowledged to be rough

__Economy
__Overview The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry which
accounts for about 70 of export earnings and 40 of tax revenues The
economy has been in trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in
1982 A drop in world bauxite prices that started in the late 1970s and
continued until late 1986 was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla
insurgency in the interior The guerrillas targeted the economic
infrastructure crippling the important bauxite sector and shutting down
other export industries These problems have created high inflation
high unemployment widespread black market activity and a bad climate
for foreign investment A small gain in economic growth of 20 was
registered in 1989 due to reduced guerrilla activity and improved
international markets for bauxite

__Economy
__Overview The economy is based on subsistence agriculture which
occupies much of the labor force and contributes about 23 to GDP
Manufacturing which includes a number of agroprocessing factories
accounts for another 26 of GDP Mining has declined in importance in
recent years highgrade iron ore deposits were depleted in 1978 and
health concerns cut world demand for asbestos Exports of sugar and
forestry products are the main earners of hard currency Surrounded by
South Africa except for a short border with Mozambique Swaziland
is heavily dependent on South Africa from which it receives 92 of
its imports and to which it sends about 40 of its exports

__Economy
__Overview Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during
World War I through World War II Sweden has achieved an enviable
standard of living under a mixed system of hightech capitalism and
extensive welfare benefits It has essentially full employment
a modern distribution system excellent internal and external
communications and a skilled labor force Timber hydropower and
iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is heavily
oriented toward foreign trade Privately owned firms account for
about 90 of industrial output of which the engineering
sector accounts for 50 of output and exports For some observers
the Swedish model has succeeded in making economic efficiency
and social egalitarianism complementary rather than competitive
goals Others argue that the Swedish model is on the verge of
collapsing by pointing to the serious economic problems Sweden
faces in 1991 high inflation and absenteeism growing unemployment
and deficits and declining international competitiveness In 1990
to improve the economy the government approved a mandate for
Sweden to seek EC membership and an austerity and privatization
package and implemented a major tax reform These reforms may
succeed in turning the economy around in 1992

__Economy

other nations Per capita output general living standards education
and science health care and diet are unsurpassed in Europe Inflation
remains low because of sound government policy and harmonious
labormanagement relations Unemployment is negligible a marked
contrast to the larger economies of Western Europe This economic
stability helps promote the important banking and tourist sectors Since
World War II Switzerlands economy has adjusted smoothly to the great
changes in output and trade patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust
to the challenges of the 1990s in particular the further economic
integration of Western Europe and the amazingly rapid changes in East

__Economy
__Overview Syrias rigidly structured Bathist economy turned
out slightly more goods in 1990 than in 1983 when the population was 20
smaller Economic difficulties are attributable in part to severe
drought in several recent years costly but unsuccessful attempts
to match Israels military strength a falloff in Arab aid and
insufficient foreign exchange earnings to buy needed inputs for industry
and agriculture Socialist policy embodied in a thicket of bureaucratic
regulations in many instances has driven away or pushed underground the
mercantile and entrepreneurial spirit for which Syrian businessmen have
long been famous Two bright spots a sizable number of villagers have
benefited from land redistribution electrification and other rural
development programs and a recent find of light crude oil has enabled
Syria to cut oil imports A longterm concern is the additional drain of
upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when its vast dam and irrigation
projects are completed toward the end of the 1990s Output in 1990
rebounded from the very bad year of 1989 as agricultural production
and oil revenues increased substantially

__Economy
__Overview Thailand one of the more advanced developing countries
in Asia enjoyed a year of 9 growth in 1990 although down from the
doubledigit rates of 198789 The increasingly sophisticated
manufacturing sector benefited from exportoriented investment but
the agricultural sector contracted 2 primarily because of weaker
demand in Thailands major overseas markets for commodities such as
rice The trade deficit almost doubled in 1990 to 9 billion but
earnings from tourism 47 billion remittances and net capital
inflows helped keep the balance of payments in surplus The government
has followed fairly sound fiscal and monetary policies aided by
increased tax receipts from the fastmoving economy In 1990 the
government approved new projectsespecially for telecommunications
and roadsneeded to refurbish the countrys now overtaxed
infrastructure Although growth in 1991 will slow further Thailands
economic outlook remains good assuming the continuation of prudent
government policies in the wake of the 23 February 1991 military coup

__Economy
__Overview Trinidad and Tobagos petroleumbased economy began to
emerge from a lengthy depression in 1990 The economy fell sharply
through most of the 1980s largely because of the decline in oil prices
This sector accounts for 80 of export earnings and more than 25 of
GDP The government in response to the oil revenue loss pursued a
series of austerity measures that pushed the unemployment rate as high
as 22 in 1988 The economy showed signs of recovery in 1990 however
helped along by rising oil prices Agriculture employs only about 11 of
the labor force and produces about 3 of GDP Since this sector is
small it has been unable to absorb the large numbers of the unemployed
The government currently seeks to diversify its export base

__Economy
__Overview The economy depends primarily on petroleum phosphates
tourism and exports of light manufactures for continued growth
Following two years of droughtinduced economic decline the economy
made a strong recovery in 1990 as a result of a bountiful harvest
continued export growth and higher domestic investment Continued
high inflation and unemployment have eroded popular support for the
government however and forced Tunis to slow the pace of economic
reform Nonetheless the government appears committed to implementing
its IMFsupported structural adjustment program and to servicing
its foreign debt

__Economy
__Overview The economic reforms that Turkey launched in 1980
continue to bring an impressive stream of benefits The economy has grown
steadily since the early 1980s with real growth in per capita GDP
increasing more than 6 annually Agriculture remains the most important
economic sector employing about 55 of the labor force accounting for
almost 20 of GDP and contributing about 20 to exports Impressive
growth in recent years has not solved all of the economic problems facing
Turkey Inflation and interest rates remain high and a large budget
deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a country undergoing a
substantial transformation from a centrally controlled to a free market
economy The government has launched a multimilliondollar development
program in the southeastern region which includes the building of a
dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to generate electric power
and irrigate large tracts of farmland The planned tapping of huge
additional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious concern in
the downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq

__Economy
__Overview Uganda has substantial natural resources including
fertile soils regular rainfall and sizable mineral deposits of copper
and cobalt The economy has been devastated by much political
instability mismanagement and civil war since independence in 1962
keeping Uganda poor with a per capita income of about 300 GDP remains
below the levels of the early 1970s as does industrial production
Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy employing over
80 of the work force Coffee is the major export crop and accounts
for the bulk of export revenues Since 1986 the government has
acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking
currency reform raising producer prices on export crops increasing
petroleum prices and improving civil service wages The policy changes
are especially aimed at dampening inflation which was running at over
300 in 1987 and boosting production and export earnings

__Economy
__Overview The UK is one of the worlds great trading powers and
financial centers and its economy ranks among the four largest in
Europe The economy is essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture
of social welfare programs and government ownership Over the last decade
the Thatcher government halted the expansion of welfare measures and
promoted extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector
Agriculture is intensive highly mechanized and efficient by European
standards producing about 60 of food needs with only 1 of the labor
force Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises employing
about 27 of the work force and generating 22 of GDP The UK is an
energyrich nation with large coal natural gas and oil reserves
primary energy production accounts for 12 of GDP one of the highest
shares of any industrial nation In mid1990 the economy fell into
recession after eight years of strong economic expansion which had
raised national output by one quarter Britains inflation rate which
has been consistently well above those of her major trading partners
is expected to decline in 1991 Between 1986 and 1990 unemployment
fell from 11 to about 6 but it is now rising rapidly because of
the economic slowdown As a major trading nation the UK will continue
to be greatly affected by world boom or recession swings in the
international oil market productivity trends in domestic industry
and the terms on which the economic integration of Europe proceeds

__Economy
__Overview The US has the most powerful diverse and
technologically advanced economy in the world with a per capita GNP
of 21800 the largest among major industrial nations In 1989 the
economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth the
longest in peacetime history The expansion featured moderation in
wage and consumer price increases and a steady reduction in
unemployment to 52 of the labor force In 1990 however growth
slowed to 1 because of a combination of factors such as the
worldwide increase in interest rates Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in
August the subsequent spurt in oil prices and a general decline
in business and consumer confidence Ongoing problems for the
1990s include inadequate investment in education and other economic
infrastructure rapidly rising medical costs and sizable budget and
trade deficits

__Economy
__Overview The economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession
of the early 1980s In 1988 real GDP grew by only 05 and in 1989 by
15 The recovery was led by growth in the agriculture and fishing
sectors agriculture alone contributing 20 to GDP employing about 11
of the labor force and generating a large proportion of export earnings
Raising livestock particularly cattle and sheep is the major
agricultural activity In 1990 despite healthy exports and an improved
current account domestic growth remained weak because of government
concentration on the external sector adverse weather conditions and
prolonged strikes Bringing down high inflation reducing a large fiscal
deficit and avoiding frequent strikes remain major economic problems
for the government

__Economy
__Overview This is a centrally planned developing economy with
extensive government ownership and control of productive facilities
The economy is primarily agricultural the sector employs about 65 of
the labor force and accounts for almost half of GNP Rice is the staple
crop substantial amounts of maize sorghum cassava and sweet potatoes
are also grown The government permits sale of surplus grain on the open
market Most of the mineral resources are located in the north
including coal which is an important export item Oil was discovered
off the southern coast in 1986 with production reaching 54000 bd in
1990 and expected to increase in the years ahead Following the
end of the war in 1975 heavyhanded government measures undermined
efforts at an efficient merger of the agricultural resources of the
south and the industrial resources of the north The economy remains
heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received assistance from
Communist countries Sweden and UN agencies Inflation although down
from recent tripledigit levels is still a major weakness and is
showing signs of accelerating upwards again Per capita output is among
the worlds lowest Since late 1986 the government has sponsored a
broad reform program that seeks to turn more economic activity over to
the private sector

__West Bank
__Note The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended
with Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the Sinai
and the Golan Heights As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and
reaffirmed by President Reagans 1 September 1982 peace initiative the
final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with
their neighbors and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be
negotiated among the concerned parties Camp David further specifies
that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries Pending
the completion of this process it is US policy that the final status of
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined In the view
of the US the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the
Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the 1967
ArabIsraeli war However with respect to negotiations envisaged in the
framework agreement it is US policy that a distinction must be made
between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys
special status and circumstances Therefore a negotiated solution for
the final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that
of the rest of the West Bank

__Economy
__Overview Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by
Israeli military occupation and the effects of the Palestinian uprising
Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable financial
resources have been discouraged by a lack of financial resources and
Israeli policy Capital investment has largely gone into residential
housing not into productive assets that could compete with Israeli
industry A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers
employed in Israel and neighboring Gulf states but remittances from the
Gulf dropped dramatically in the wake of Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990 Israeli reprisals against Palestinian unrest in the West
Bank since 1987 have pushed unemployment up and lowered living standards
The Persian Gulf crisis of 199091 also dealt a blow to the economy
Many Palestinians returned from the Gulf exacerbating unemployment
Export revenues have plunged because of the loss of export markets in
Jordan and the Gulf

__Overview In 1990 the world economy grew at an estimated 10
considerably lower than the estimated 30 for 1989 and the 34 for
1988 The technologically advanced areasNorth America Japan and
Western Europetogether account for 67 of the gross world product GWP
of 209 trillion these developed areas grew in the aggregate at 23
in 1990 In contrast output in the USSR and Eastern Europe fell an
average of 52 these countries account for 15 of GWP Experience
in the developing countries continued mixed with the newly
industrializing economies generally maintaining their rapid growth
and many others struggling with debt rampant inflation and inadequate
investment This third group contributed 18 of GWP and grew on
average 23 in 1990 output in this group is probably understated
because of lack of data and the method of calculation used The year 1990
witnessed continued political and economic upheavals in the USSR and
Eastern Europe which are in between systems lacking both the rough
discipline of the command economy and the institutions of the market
economy As for prospects in the 1990s the addition of nearly 100
million people a year to an already overcrowded globe will exacerbate the
problems of pollution desertification underemployment epidemics
and famine

__Economy
__Overview Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political
capital of a united Yemen the southern city Aden with its refinery
and port facilities is the economic and commercial capital Future
economic development depends heavily on Westernassisted development
of promising oil resources South Yemens willingness to merge stemmed
partly from the steady decline in Soviet economic support

NorthThe low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made
northern Yemen dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential
needs Large trade deficits have been made up for by remittances from
Yemenis working abroad and foreign aid Once selfsufficient in food
production northern Yemen has been a major importer Land once used for
export cropscotton fruit and vegetableshas been turned over to
growing qat a mildly narcotic shrub chewed by Yemenis that has no
significant export market Oil export revenues started flowing in late
1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about 800 million

SouthThis has been one of the poorest Arab countries with a per
capita GNP of about 500 A shortage of natural resources a widely
dispersed population and an arid climate have made economic development
difficult The economy has grown at an average annual rate of only 23
since the mid1970s The economy had been organized along socialist
lines dominated by the public sector Economic growth has been
constrained by a lack of incentives partly stemming from centralized
control over production decisions investment allocation and import
choices

__Flag three equal horizontal bands of blue top white and red

__Economy
__Overview For 20 years Communist Yugoslavia had been trying to
replace the Stalinist command economy with a decentralized semimarket
system that features worker selfmanagement councils in all large plants
This hybrid system neared collapse in late 1989 when inflation soared
The government applied shock therapy in 1990 under an IMF standby
program that provides tight control over monetary expansion a freeze
on wages the pegging of the dinar to the deutsche mark and a partial
price freeze on energy transportation and communal services This
program brought hyperinflation to a halt and encouraged a rise in
foreign investment Since June 1990 however inflation has
rebounded and threatens to rise further in 1991 Estimated annual
inflation for 1990 is 164 Other huge problems remain rising
unemployment the low quality of industrial output and striking
differences in income between the poorer southern regions and the
comparatively welloff northern areas Even so political issues far
outweigh economic problems in importance

__Economy
__Overview The economy has been in decline for more than a decade
with falling imports and growing foreign debt Economic difficulties
stem from a sustained drop in copper production and ineffective economic
policies In 1990 real GDP stood only slightly higher than that of 10
years before while an annual population growth of more than 3 has
brought a decline in per capita GDP of 25 during the same period A
high inflation rate has also added to Zambias economic woes in recent
years

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card

with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
