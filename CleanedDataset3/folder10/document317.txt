THE CULPRIT FAY


 My visual orbs are purged from film and lo
 Instead of Ansters turnipbearing vales
 I see old fairy lands miraculous show
 Her trees of tinsel kissed by freakish gales
 Her Ouphs that cloaked in leafgold skim the breeze
 And fairies swarming

 TENNANTS ANSTER FAIR

I

Tis the middle watch of a summers night
The earth is dark but the heavens are bright
Nought is seen in the vault on high
But the moon and the stars and the cloudless sky
And the flood which rolls its milky hue
A river of light on the welkin blue
The moon looks down on old Cronest
She mellows the shades on his shaggy breast
And seems his huge gray form to throw
In a sliver cone on the wave below
His sides are broken by spots of shade
By the walnut bough and the cedar made
And through their clustering branches dark
Glimmers and dies the fireflys spark
Like starry twinkles that momently break
Through the rifts of the gathering tempests rack

II

The stars are on the moving stream
 And fling as its ripples gently flow
A burnished length of wavy beam
 In an eellike spiral line below
The winds are whist and the owl is still
 The bat in the shelvy rock is hid
And nought is heard on the lonely hill
But the crickets chirp and the answer shrill
 Of the gauzewinged katydid
And the plaint of the wailing whippoorwill
 Who moans unseen and ceaseless sings
Ever a note of wail and wo
 Till morning spreads her rosy wings
And earth and sky in her glances glow

III

Tis the hour of fairy ban and spell
The woodtick has kept the minutes well
He has counted them all with click and stroke
Deep in the heart of the mountain oak
And he has awakened the sentry elve
 Who sleeps with him in the haunted tree
To bid him ring the hour of twelve
 And call the fays to their revelry
Twelve small strokes on his tinkling bell
Twas made of the white snails pearly shell
Midnight comes and all is well
Hither hither wing your way
Tis the dawn of the fairy day

IV

They come from beds of lichen green
They creep from the mullens velvet screen
 Some on the backs of beetles fly
From the silver tops of moontouched trees
 Where they swung in their cobweb hammocks high
And rockd about in the evening breeze
 Some from the humbirds downy nest
They had driven him out by elfin power
 And pillowed on plumes of his rainbow breast
Had slumbered there till the charmed hour
 Some had lain in the scoop of the rock
With glittering isingstars inlaid
 And some had opened the fouroclock
And stole within its purple shade
 And now they throng the moonlight glade
Abovebelowon every side
 Their little minim forms arrayed
In the tricksy pomp of fairy pride

V

They come not now to print the lea
In freak and dance around the tree
Or at the mushroom board to sup
And drink the dew from the buttercup
A scene of sorrow waits them now
For an Ouphe has broken his vestal vow
He has loved an earthly maid
And left for her his woodland shade
He has lain upon her lip of dew
And sunned him in her eye of blue
Fannd her cheek with his wing of air
Played in the ringlets of her hair
And nestling on her snowy breast
Forgot the lilykings behest
For this the shadowy tribes of air
 To the elfin court must haste away
And now they stand expectant there
 To hear the doom of the Culprit Fay

VI

The throne was reared upon the grass
Of spicewood and of sassafras
On pillars of mottled tortoiseshell
 Hung the burnished canopy
And oer it gorgeous curtains fell
 Of the tulips crimson drapery
The monarch sat on his judgmentseat
 On his brow the crown imperial shone
The prisoner Fay was at his feet
 And his peers were ranged around the throne
He waved his sceptre in the air
 He looked around and calmly spoke
His brow was grave and his eye severe
 But his voice in a softened accent broke

VII

Fairy Fairy list and mark
 Thou hast broke thine elfin chain
Thy flamewood lamp is quenched and dark
 And thy wings are dyed with a deadly stain
Thou hast sullied thine elfin purity
In the glance of a mortal maidens eye
Thou hast scorned our dread decree
And thou shouldst pay the forfeit high
But well I know her sinless mind
Is pure as the angel forms above
Gentle and meek and chaste and kind
Such as a spirit well might love
Fairy had she spot or taint
Bitter had been thy punishment
Tied to the hornets shardy wings
Tossed on the pricks of nettles stings
Or seven long ages doomed to dwell
With the lazy worm in the walnutshell
Or every night to writhe and bleed
Beneath the tread of the centipede
Or bound in a cobweb dungeon dim
Your jailer a spider huge and grim
Amid the carrion bodies to lie
Of the worm and the bug and the murdered fly
These it had been your lot to bear
Had a stain been found on the earthly fair
Now list and mark our mild decree
Fairy this your doom must be

VIII

Thou shalt seek the beach of sand
Where the water bounds the elfin land
Thou shalt watch the oozy brine
Till the sturgeon leaps in the bright moonshine
Then dart the glistening arch below
And catch a drop from his silver bow
The watersprites will wield their arms
 And dash around with roar and rave
And vain are the woodland spirits charms
 They are the imps that rule the wave
Yet trust thee in thy single might
If thy heart be pure and thy spirit right
Thou shalt win the warlock fight

IX

If the spraybead gem be won
 The stain of thy wing is washed away
But another errand must be done
 Ere thy crime be lost for aye
Thy flamewood lamp is quenched and dark
Thou must reillume its spark
Mount thy steed and spur him high
To the heavens blue canopy
And when thou seest a shooting star
Follow it fast and follow it far
The last faint spark of its burning train
Shall light the elfin lamp again
Thou hast heard our sentence Fay
Hence to the waterside away

X

The goblin marked his monarch well
 He spake not but he bowed him low
Then plucked a crimson colenbell
 And turned him round in act to go
The way is long he cannot fly
 His soiled wing has lost its power
And he winds adown the mountain high
 For many a sore and weary hour
Through dreary beds of tangled fern
Through groves of nightshade dark and dern
Over the grass and through the brake
Where toils the ant and sleeps the snake
 Now oer the violets azure flush
He skips along in lightsome mood
 And now he thrids the bramble bush
Till its points are dyed in fairy blood
He has leapt the bog he has pierced the briar
He has swum the brook and waded the mire
Till his spirits sank and his limbs grew weak
And the red waxed fainter in his cheek
He had fallen to the ground outright
 For rugged and dim was his onward track
But there came a spotted toad in sight
 And he laughed as he jumped upon her back
He bridled her mouth with a silkweed twist
 He lashed her sides with an osier thong
And now through evenings dewy mist
 With leap and spring they bound along
Till the mountains magic verge is past
And the beach of sand is reached at last

XI

Soft and pale is the moony beam
Moveless still the glassy stream
The wave is clear the beach is bright
 With snowy shells and sparkling stones
The shoresurge comes in ripples light
 In murmurings faint and distant moans
And ever afar in the silence deep
Is heard the splash of the sturgeons leap
And the bend of his graceful bow is seen
A glittering arch of silver sheen
Spanning the wave of burnished blue
And dripping with gems of the river dew

XII

The elfin cast a glance around
 As he lighted down from his courser toad
Then round his breast his wings he wound
 And close to the rivers brink he strode
He sprang on a rock he breathed a prayer
 Above his head his arms he threw
Then tossed a tiny curve in air
 And headlong plunged in the waters blue

XIII

Up sprung the spirits of the waves
From seasilk beds in their coral caves
With snailplate armour snatched in haste
They speed their way through the liquid waste
Some are rapidly borne along
On the mailed shrimp or the prickly prong
Some on the bloodred leeches glide
Some on the stony starfish ride
Some on the back of the lancing squab
Some on the sidelong soldiercrab
And some on the jellied quarl that flings
At once a thousand streamy stings
They cut the wave with the living oar
And hurry on to the moonlight shore
To guard their realms and chase away
The footsteps of the invading Fay

XIV

Fearlessly he skims along
His hope is high and his limbs are strong
He spreads his arms like the swallows wing
And throws his feet with a froglike fling
His locks of gold on the waters shine
 At his breast the tiny foambeads rise
His back gleams bright above the brine
 And the wakeline foam behind him lies
But the watersprites are gathering near
To check his course along the tide
Their warriors come in swift career
 And hem him round on every side
On his thigh the leech has fixed his hold
The quarls long arms are round him rolld
The prickly prong has pierced his skin
And the squab has thrown his javelin
The gritty star has rubbed him raw
And the crab has struck with his giant claw
He howls with rage and he shrieks with pain
He strikes around but his blows are vain
Hopeless is the unequal fight
Fairy nought is left but flight

XV

He turned him round and fled amain
With hurry and dash to the beach again
He twisted over from side to side
And laid his cheek to the cleaving tide
The strokes of his plunging arms are fleet
And with all his might he flings his feet
But the watersprites are round him still
To cross his path and work him ill
They bade the wave before him rise
They flung the seafire in his eyes
And they stunned his ears with the scallop stroke
With the porpoise heave and the drumfish croak
Oh but a weary wight was he
When he reached the foot of the dogwood tree
Gashed and wounded and stiff and sore
He laid him down on the sandy shore
He blessed the force of the charmed line
 And he banned the watergoblins spite
For he saw around in the sweet moonshine
Their little wee faces above the brine
Giggling and laughing with all their might
At the piteous hap of the Fairy wight

XVI

Soon he gathered the balsam dew
 From the sorrel leaf and the henbane bud
Over each wound the balm he drew
 And with cobweb lint he stanched the blood
The mild west wind was soft and low
It cooled the heat of his burning brow
And he felt new life in his sinews shoot
As he drank the juice of the calmus root
And now he treads the fatal shore
As fresh and vigorous as before

XVII

Wrapped in musing stands the sprite
Tis the middle wane of night
 His task is hard his way is far
But he must do his errand right
 Ere dawning mounts her beamy car
And rolls her chariot wheels of light
And vain are the spells of fairyland
He must work with a human hand

XVIII

He cast a saddened look around
 But he felt new joy his bosom swell
When glittering on the shadowed ground
 He saw a purple muscle shell
Thither he ran and he bent him low
He heaved at the stern and he heaved at the bow
And he pushed her over the yielding sand
Till he came to the verge of the haunted land
She was as lovely a pleasure boat
 As ever fairy had paddled in
For she glowed with purple paint without
 And shone with silvery pearl within
A scullers notch in the stern he made
An oar he shaped of the bootle blade
Then spung to his seat with a lightsome leap
And launched afar on the calm blue deep

XIX

The imps of the river yell and rave
They had no power above the wave
But they heaved the billow before the prow
 And they dashed the surge against her side
And they struck her keel with jerk and blow
 Till the gunwale bent to the rocking tide
She wimpled about in the pale moonbeam
Like a feather that floats on a wind tossedstream
And momently athwart her track
The quarl upreared his island back
And the fluttering scallop behind would float
And patter the water about the boat
But he bailed her out with his colenbell
 And he kept her trimmed with a wary tread
While on every side like lightening fell
 The heavy strokes of his bootleblade

XX

Onward still he held his way
Till he came where the column of moonshine lay
And saw beneath the surface dim
The brownbacked sturgeon slowly swim
Around him were the goblin train
But he sculled with all his might and main
And followed wherever the sturgeon led
Till he saw him upward point his head
Then he dropped his paddle blade
And held his colen goblet up
To catch the drop in its crimson cup

XXI

With sweeping tail and quivering fin
 Through the wave the sturgeon flew
And like the heavenshot javelin
 He sprung above the waters blue
Instant as the starfall light
 He plunged him in the deep again
But left an arch of silver bright
 The rainbow of the moony main
It was a strange and lovely sight
 To see the puny goblin there
He seemed an angel form of light
 With azure wing and sunny hair
Throned on a cloud of purple fair
Circled with blue and edged with white
And sitting at the fall of even
Beneath the bow of summer heaven

XXII

A moment and its lustre fell
 But ere it met the billow blue
He caught within his crimson bell
 A droplet of its sparkling dew
Joy to thee Fay thy task is done
Thy wings are pure for the gem is won
Cheerly ply thy dripping oar
And haste away to the elfin shore

XXIII

He turns and lo on either side
The ripples on his path divide
And the track oer which his boat must pass
Is smooth as a sheet of polished glass
Around their limbs the seanymphs lave
 With snowy arms half swelling out
While on the glossed and gleamy wave
 Their seagreen ringlets loosely float
They swim around with smile and song
 They press the bark with pearly hand
And gently urge her course along
 Toward the beach of speckled sand
 And as he lightly leapt to land
They bade adieu with nod and bow
Then gayly kissed each little hand
And dropped in the crystal deep below

XXIV

A moment staied the fairy there
He kissed the beach and breathed a prayer
Then spread his wings of gilded blue
And on to the elfin court he flew
As ever ye saw a bubble rise
And shine with a thousand changing dyes
Till lessening far through ether driven
It mingles with the hues of heaven
As at the glimpse of morning pale
The lancefly spreads his silken sail
And gleams with blendings soft and bright
Till lost in the shades of fading night
So rose from earth the lovely Fay
So vanished far in heaven away

    

Up Fairy quit thy chickweed bower
The cricket has called the second hour
Twice again and the lark will rise
To kiss the streaking of the skies
Up thy charmed armour don
Thoult need it ere the night be gone

XXV

He put his acorn helmet on
It was plumed of the silk of the thistle down
The corslet plate that guarded his breast
Was once the wild bees golden vest
His cloak of a thousand mingled dyes
Was formed of the wings of butterflies
His shield was the shell of a ladybug queen
Studs of gold on a ground of green
And the quivering lance which he brandished bright
Was the sting of a wasp he had slain in fight
 Swift he bestrode his firefly steed
He bared his blade of the bent grass blue
He drove his spurs of the cockle seed
 And away like a glance of thought he flew
To skim the heavens and follow far
The fiery trail of the rocketstar

XXVI

The mothfly as he shot in air
Crept under the leaf and hid her there
The katydid forgot its lay
The prowling gnat fled fast away
The fell mosqueto checked his drone
And folded his wings till the Fay was gone
And the wily beetle dropped his head
And fell on the ground as if he were dead
They crouched them close in the darksome shade
 They quaked all oer with awe and fear
For they had felt the bluebent blade
 And writhed at the prick of the elfin spear
Many a time on a summers night
When the sky was clear and the moon was bright
They had been roused from the haunted ground
By the yelp and bay of the fairy hound
They had heard the tiny bugle horn
They had heard of twang of the maizesilk string
When the vinetwig bows were tightly drawn
And the nettleshaft through the air was borne
Feathered with down the humbirds wing
And now they deemed the courier ouphe
 Some hunter sprite of the elfin ground
And they watched till they saw him mount the roof
 That canopies the world around
Then glad they left their covert lair
And freaked about in the midnight air

XXVII

Up to the vaulted firmament
His path the firefly courser bent
And at every gallop on the wind
He flung a glittering spark behind
He flies like a feather in the blast
Till the first light cloud in heaven is past
 But the shapes of air have begun their work
And a drizzly mist is round him cast
 He cannot see through the mantle murk
He shivers with cold but he urges fast
 Through storm and darkness sleet and shade
He lashes his steed and spurs amain
For shadowy hands have twitched the rein
 And flameshot tongues around him played
And near him many a fiendish eye
Glared with a fell malignity
And yells of rage and shrieks of fear
Came screaming on his startled ear

XXVIII

His wings are wet around his breast
The plume hangs dripping from his crest
His eyes are blurd with the lightnings glare
And his ears are stunned with the thunders blare
But he gave a shout and his blade he drew
 He thrust before and he struck behind
Till he pierced their cloudy bodies through
 And gashed their shadowy limbs of wind
Howling the misty spectres flew
 They rend the air with frightful cries
For he has gained the welkin blue
 And the land of clouds beneath him lies

XXIX

Up to the cope careering swift
 In breathless motion fast
Fleet as the swallow cuts the drift
 Or the searoc rides the blast
The sapphire sheet of eve is shot
 The sphered moon is past
The earth but seems a tiny blot
 On a sheet of azure cast
O it was sweet in the clear moonlight
 To tread the starry plain of even
To meet the thousand eyes of night
 And feel the cooling breath of heaven
But the Elfin made no stop or stay
Till he came to the bank of the milkyway
Then he checked his coursers foot
And watched for the glimpse of the planetshoot

XXX

Sudden along the snowy tide
 That swelled to meet their footsteps fall
The sylphs of heaven were seen to glide
 Attired in sunsets crimson pall
Around the Fay they weave the dance
 They skip before him on the plain
And one has taken his waspsting lance
 And one upholds his bridle rein
With warblings wild they lead him on
 To where through clouds of amber seen
Studded with stars resplendent shone
 The palace of the sylphid queen
Its spiral columns gleaming bright
Were streamers of the northern light
Its curtains light and lovely flush
Was of the mornings rosy blush
And the ceiling fair that rose aboon
The white and feathery fleece of noon

XXXI

But oh how fair the shape that lay
 Beneath a rainbow bending bright
She seemed to the entranced Fay
 The loveliest of the forms of light
Her mantle was the purple rolled
 At twilight in the west afar
Twas tied with threads of dawning gold
 And buttoned with a sparkling star
Her face was like the lily roon
 That veils the vestal planets hue
Her eyes two beamlets from the moon
 Set floating in the welkin blue
Her hair is like the sunny beam
And the diamond gems which round it gleam
Are the pure drops of dewy even
That neer have left their native heaven

XXXII

She raised her eyes to the wondering sprite
 And they leapt with smiles for well I ween
Never before in the bowers of light
 Had the form of an earthly Fay been seen
Long she looked in his tiny face
 Long with his butterfly cloak she played
She smoothed his wings of azure lace
 And handled the tassel of his blade
And as he told in accents low
The story of his love and wo
She felt new pains in her bosom rise
 And the teardrop started in her eyes
And O sweet spirit of earth she cried
 Return no more to your woodland height
But ever here with me abide
 In the land of everlasting light
Within the fleecy drift well lie
 Well hang upon the rainbows rim
And all the jewels of the sky
Around thy brow shall brightly beam
And thou shalt bathe thee in the stream
 That rolls its whitening foam aboon
And ride upon the lightnings gleam
 And dance upon the orbed moon
Well sit within the Pleiad ring
 Well rest on Orions starry belt
And I will bid my sylphs to sing
 The song that makes the dewmist melt
Their harps are of the umber shade
 That hides the blush of waking day
And every gleamy string is made
 Of silvery moonshines lengthened ray
And thou shalt pillow on my breast
 While heavenly breathings float around
And with the sylphs of ether blest
 Forget the joys of fairy ground

XXXIII

She was lovely and fair to see
And the elfins heart beat fitfully
But lovelier far and still more fair
The earthly form imprinted there
Nought he saw in the heavens above
Was half so dear as his mortal love
For he thought upon her looks so meek
And he thought of the light flush on her cheek
Never again might he bask and lie
On that sweet cheek and moonlight eye
But in his dreams her form to see
To clasp her in his reverie
To think upon his virgin bride
Was worth all heaven and earth beside

XXXIV

Lady he cried I have sworn tonight
On the word of a fairy knight
To do my sentencetask aright
My honour scarce is free from stain
I may not soil its snows again
Betide me weal betide me wo
Its mandate must be answered now
Her bosom heaved with many a sigh
The tear was in her drooping eye
 But she led him to the palace gate
And called the sylphs who hovered there
 And bade them fly and bring him straight
Of clouds condensed a sable car
With charm and spell she blessed it there
From all the fiends of upper air
Then round him cast the shadowy shroud
And tied his steed behind the cloud
And pressed his hand as she bade him fly
Far to the verge of the northern sky
For by its wane and wavering light
There was a star would fall tonight

XXXV

Borne after on the wings of the blast
Northward away he speeds him fast
And his courser follows the cloudy wain
Till the hoofstrokes fall like pattering rain
The clouds roll backward as he flies
Each flickering star behind him lies
And he has reached the northern plain
And backed his firefly steed again
Ready to follow in its flight
The streaming of the rocketlight

XXXVI

The star is yet in the vault of heaven
 But its rocks in the summer gale
And now tis fitful and uneven
 And now tis deadly pale
And now tis wrappd in sulphur smoke
 And quenched is its rayless beam
And now with a rattling thunderstroke
 It bursts in flash and flame
As swift as the glance of the arrowy lance
 That the stormspirit flings from high
The starshot flew oer the welkin blue
 As it fell from the sheeted sky
As swift as the wind in its trail behind
 The elfin gallops along
The fiends of the clouds are bellowing loud
 But the sylphid charm is strong
He gallops unhurt in the shower of fire
 While the cloudfiends fly from the blaze
He watches each flake till its sparks expire
 And rides in the light of its rays
But he drove his steed to the lightnings speed
 And caught a glimmering spark
Then wheeled around to the fairy ground
 And sped through the midnight dark

    

Ouphe and goblin imp and sprite
 Elf of eve and starry Fay
Ye that love the moons soft light
 Hitherhither wend your way
Twine ye in the jocund ring
 Sing and trip it merrily
Hand to hand and wing to wing
 Round the wild witchhazel tree

Hail the wanderer again
 With dance and song and lute and lyre
Pure his wing and strong his chain
 And doubly bright his fairy fire
Twine ye in an airy round
 Brush the dew and print the lea
Skip and gambol hop and bound
 Round the wild witchhazel tree

The beetle guards our holy ground
 He flies about the haunted place
And if mortal there be found
 He hums in his ears and flaps his face
The leafharp sounds our roundelay
 The owlets eyes our lanterns be
Thus we sing and dance and play
 Round the wild witchhazel tree

But hark from tower on treetop high
 The sentry elf his call has made
A streak is in the eastern sky
 Shapes of moonlight flit and fade
The hilltops gleam in mornings spring
The skylark shakes his dappled wing
The dayglimpse glimmers on the lawn
The cock has crowed the Fays are gone




TO A FRIEND


 You damn me with faint praise

I

 Yes faint was my applause and cold my praise
 Though soul was glowing in each polished line
 But nobler subjects claim the poets lays
 A brighter glory waits a muse like thine
 Let amorous fools in lovesick measure pine
 Let Strangford whimper on in fancied pain
 And leave to Moore his rose leaves and his vine
 Be thine the task a higher crown to gain
The envied wreath that decks the patriots holy strain

II

 Yet not in proud triumphal song alone
 Or martial ode or sad sepulchral dirge
 There needs no voice to make our glories known
 There needs no voice the warriors soul to urge
 To tread the bounds of natures stormy verge
 Columbia still shall win the battles prize
 But be it thine to bid her mind emerge
 To strike her harp until its soul arise
From the neglected shade where low in dust it lies

III

 Are there no scenes to touch the poets soul
 No deeds of arms to wake the lordly strain
 Shall Hudsons billows unregarded roll
 Has Warren fought Montgomery died in vain
 Shame that while every mountain stream and plain
 Hath theme for truths proud voice or fancys wand
 No native bard the patriot harp hath taen
 But left to minstrels of a foreign strand
To sing the beauteous scenes of natures loveliest land

IV

 Oh for a seat on Appalachias brow
 That I might scan the glorious prospect round
 Wild waving woods and rolling floods below
 Smooth level glades and fields with grain embrownd
 High heaving hills with tufted forests crownd
 Rearing their tall tops to the heavens blue dome
 And emerald isles like banners green unwound
 Floating along the lake while round them roam
Bright helms of billowy blue and plumes of dancing foam

V

 Tis true no fairies haunt our verdant meads
 No grinning imps deform our blazing hearth
 Beneath the kelpies fang no traveller bleeds
 Nor gory vampyre taints our holy earth
 Nor spectres stalk to frighten harmless mirth
 Nor tortured demon howls adown the gale
 Fair reason checks these monsters in their birth
 Yet have we lay of love and horrid tale
Would dim the manliest eye and make the bravest pale

VI

 Where is the stony eye that hath not shed
 Compassions heartdrops oer the sweet Mc Rea
 Through midnights wilds by savage bandits led
 Her heart is sadher love is far away
 Elate that lover waits the promised day
 When he shall clasp his blooming bride again
 Shine on sweet visions dreams of rapture play
 Soon the cold corse of her he loved in vain
Shall blight his withered heart and fire his frenzied brain

VII

 Romantic Wyoming could none be found
 Of all that rove thy Eden groves among
 To wake a native harps untutored sound
 And give thy tale of wo the voice of song
 Oh if descriptions cold and nerveless tongue
 From stranger harps such hallowed strains could call
 How doubly sweet the descant wild had rung
 From one who lingering round thy ruined wall
Had plucked thy mourning flowers and wept thy timeless fall

VIII

 The Huron chief escaped from foemen nigh
 His frail bark launches on Niagaras tides
 Pride in his port defiance in his eye
 Singing his song of death the warrior glides
 In vain they yell along the river sides
 In vain the arrow from its sheaf is torn
 Calm to his doom the willing victim rides
 And till adown the roaring torrent borne
Mocks them with gesture proud and laughs their rage to scorn

IX

 But if the charms of daisied hill and vale
 And rolling flood and towering rock sublime
 If warrior deed or peasants lowly tale
 Of love or wo should fail to wake the rhyme
 If to the wildest heights of song you climb
 Tho some who know you less might cry beware
 Onward I sayyour strains shall conquer time
 Give your bright genius wing and hope to share
Imaginations worldsthe ocean earth and air

X

 Arouse my friendlet vivid fancy soar
 Look with creative eye on natures face
 Bid airy sprites in wild Niagara roar
 And view in every field a fairy race
 Spur thy good Pacolet to speed apace
 And spread a train of nymphs on every shore
 Or if thy muse would woo a ruder grace
 The Indians evil Manitous explore
And rear the wondrous tale of legendary lore

XI

 Away to Susquehannahs utmost springs
 Where throned in mountain mist Areouski reigns
 Shrouding in lurid clouds his plumeless wings
 And sternly sorrowing oer his tribes remains
 His was the arm like comet ere it wanes
 That tore the streamy lightnings from the skies
 And smote the mammoth of the southern plains
 Wild with dismay the Creek affrighted flies
While in triumphant pride Kanawas eagles rise

XII

 Or westward far where dark Miami wends
 Seek that fair spot as yet to fame unknown
 Where when the vesper dew of heaven descends
 Soft music breathes in many a melting tone
 At times so sadly sweet it seems the moan
 Of some poor Ariel penanced in the rock
 Anon a louder bursta scream a groan
 And now amid the tempests reeling shock
Gibber and shriek and wailand fiendlike laugh and mock

XIII

 Or climb the Pallisados lofty brows
 Were dark Omana waged the war of hell
 Till waked to wrath the mighty spirit rose
 And pent the demons in their prison cell
 Full on their head the uprooted mountain fell
 Enclosing all within its horrid womb
 Straight from the teeming earth the waters swell
 And pillared rocks arise in cheerless gloom
Around the drear abodetheir last eternal tomb

XIV

 Be these your future themesno more resign
 The soul of song to laud your ladys eyes
 Go kneel a worshipper at natures shrine
 For you her fields are green and fair her skies
 For you her rivers flow her hills arise
 And will you scorn them all to pour forth tame
 And heartless lays of feigned or fancied sighs
 Still will you cloud the muse nor blush for shame
To cast away renown and hide your head from fame




EXTRACTS FROM
LEON
AN UNFINISHED POEM


    

It is a summer evening calm and fair
A warm yet freshening glow is in the air
Along its bank the cool stream wanders slow
Like parting friends that linger as they go
The willows as its waters meekly glide
Bend their dishevelled tresses to the tide
And seem to give it with a moaning sigh
A farewell touch of tearful sympathy
Each dusky copse is clad in darkest green
A blackening mass just edged with silver sheen
From yon clear moon who in her glassy face
Seems to reflect the risings of the place
For on her still pale orb the eye may see
Dim spots of shadowy brown like distant tree
Or faroff hillocks on a moonlight lea
The stars have lit in heaven their lamps of gold
The viewless dew falls lightly on the wold
The gentle air that softly sweeps the leaves
A strain of faint unearthly music weaves
As when the harp of heaven remotely plays
Or cygnets wailor song of sorrowing fays
That float amid the moonshine glimmerings pale
On wings of woven air in some enchanted vale

It is an eve that drops a heavenly balm
To lull the feelings to a sober calm
To bid wild passions fiery flush depart
And smooth the troubled waters of the heart
To give a tranquil fixedness to grief
A cherished gloom that wishes not relief

Torn is that heart and bitter are its throes
That cannot feel on such a night repose
And yet one breast there is that breathes this air
An eye that wanders oer the prospect fair
That sees yon placid moon and the pure sky
Of mild unclouded blue and still that eye
Is thrown in restless vacancy around
Or cast in gloomy trance on the cold ground
And still that breast with maddening passion burns
And hatred love and sorrow rule by turns

A lovely figure and in happier hour
When pleasure laughd abroad from hall and bower
The general eye had deemd her smiling face
The brightest jewel in the courtly place
So glossy is her hairs ensabled wreath
So glowing warm the eye that burns beneath
With so much graceful sweetness of address
And such a form of rounded slenderness
Ah where is he on whom these beauties shine
But deems a spotless soul inhabits such a shrine

And yet a keen observer might espy
Strange passions lurking in her deep black eye
And in the lines of her fine lip a soul
That in its every feeling spurned control
They passed unnotedwho will stop to trace
A sullying spot on beautys sparkling face
And no one deemed amid her glances sweet
Hers was a bosom of impetuous heat
A heart too wildly in its joys elate
Formed but to madly loveor madly hate
A spirit of strong throbs and steadfast will
To doat detest to die for or to kill
Which like the Arab chief would fiercely dare
To stab the heart she might no longer share
And yet so tender if he loved again
Would die to save his breast one moments pain

But he who cast his gaze upon her now
And read the traces written on her brow
Had scarce believed hers was that form of light
That beamed like fabled wonder on the sight
Her raven hair hung down in loosend tress
Before her wan cheeks pallid ghastliness
And thro its thick locks showed the deadly white
Like marble glimpses of a tomb at night
In fixed and horrid musings now she stands
Her eyes now bent to earth and her cold hands
Prest to her heart now wildly thrown on high
They wander oer her browand now a sigh
Breaks deep and fulland more composedly
She half exclaimsNo noit cannot be
He loves not never loved not even when
He pressed my wedded handI knew it then
And yetfool that I wasI saw he strove
In vain to kindle pity into love
But Florence she so loveda sister too
My earliest dearest playmateone who grew
Upon my very heartto rend it so
His falsehood I could bearbut hers ah no
She is not falseI feel she loves me yet
And if my boding bosom could forget
Its wild imaginings with what sweet pain
Id clasp my Florence to my breast again
With that came many a thought of days gone by
Remembered joys of mirthful infancy
And youths gay frolic and the shortlived flow
Of showering tears in childhoods fleeting wo
And lifes maturer friendshipand the sense
Of heartwarm open fearless confidence
All these came thronging with a tender call
And her own Florence mingled with them all
And softened feelings rose amid her pain
While from her eyes the clouds melted in gentle rain

A hectic pleasure flushed her faded face
It fledand deeper paleness took its place
Then a cold shudder thrilld herand at last
Her lip a smile of bitter sarcasm cast
As if she scorned herself that she could be
A moment lulled by that sweet sophistry
For in that little minute memorys sting
Gave word and look sigh gestureevery thing
To bid these dear delusive phantoms fly
And fix her fears in dreadful certainty

 It traced the very progress of their love
From the first meeting in the locust grove
When from the chase Leon came bounding there
Backing his courser with a noble air
His brown cheek flushed with healthful exercise
And his warm spirits leaping in his eyes
It told how lovely looked her sister then
To longlost friends and home just come again
How on her cheek the tears of meeting lay
That tear which only feeling hearts can pay
While the quick pleasure glistened in her eye
Like clouds and sunshine in an April sky
And then it told as their acquaintance grew
How close the unseen bonds of union drew
Their souls together and how pleased they were
The same blythe pastimes and delights to share
How the same chord in each at once would strike
Their taste their wishes and their joys alike

 All this was innocent but soon there came
Blushes and starts of consciousness and shame
That when she entered upon either cheek
The hasty blood in guilty red would speak
Of something that should not be knownand still
Sighs half suppressed seemed struggling with the will
It told how oft at eve was Leon gone
In moody wandering to the wood alone
And in the night how many a broken dream
Of bliss or terror seemed to shake his frame
How Florence too in long abstracted fit
Of soulwrapt musing for whole hours would sit
Nor even the power of music friend or book
Could chase her deep forgetfulness of look
And how when questionedwith an indrawn sigh
In vague and faroff phrase she made reply
And smiled and struggled to be gay and free
And then relapsed in dreaming reverie
How when of Leon she was forced to speak
Unbidden crimson mantled in her cheek
And when he entered how her eye would swim
And strive to look on every one but him
Yet by unconscious fascination led
In quick short glance each moment towrds him fled
How he too seemed to shun her speech and gaze
And yet he always lingered where she was
Though nothing in his aspect or his air
Told that he knew she was in presence there
But an appearance of constrained distress
And a dull tongue of moveless silentness
And a down drooping eye of gloom and sadness
Oh how unlike his former face of gladness
Tis plain too plain and I am lost she cried
And in that thought her last good feeling died

 That thought of hopeless sorrow seemed to dart
A thousand stings at once into her heart
But a strong effort quelled it and she gave
The next to hatred vengeance and the grave
Her face was calmly stern and but a glare
Within her eyesthere was no feature there
That told what lashing fiends her inmates were
Withinthere was no thought to bid her swerve
From her intentbut every strained nerve
Was settled and bent up with terrible force
To some deep deed far far beyond remorse
No glimpse of mercys light her purpose crost
Love nature pity in its depths were lost
Or lent an added fury to the ire
That seared her soul with unconsuming fire
All that was dear in the wide earth was gone
She loved but two and these she doted on
With passionate ardourand the close strong press
Of womans heartcored clinging tenderness
These links were torn and now she stood alone
Bereft of all her husband sistergone
Ah who can tell that neer has known such fate
What wild and dreadful strength it gives to hate
What had she left Revenge Revenge was there
He crushed remorse and wrestled down despair
Held his red torch to memorys page and threw
A bloody stain on every line she drew
She felt dark pleasure with her frenzy blend
And hugged him to her heart and called him friend

When sorrowing clouds the face of heaven deform
And hopes bright star sets darkly in the storm
Around us ghastly shapes and phantoms swim
And all beyond is formless vague and dim
Or lifes cold barren path before us lies
A wild and weary waste of tears and sighs
From the lorn heart each sweetening solace gone
Abandoned friendless withered lost and lone
And when with keener pangs we bleed to know
That hands beloved have struck the deepest blow
That friends we deemed most true and held most dear
Have stretched the pall of death oer pleasures bier
Repaid our trusting faith with serpent guile
Cursed with a kiss and stabbed beneath a smile
What then remains for souls of tender mould
One last and silent refuge calm and cold
A resting place for miserys gentle slave
Hearts break but once no wrongs can reach the grave

Rest ye mild spirits of afflicted worth
Sweet is your slumber in the quiet earth
And soon the voice of heaven shall bid you rise
To meet rewarding smiles in yonder skies
But where for solace shall the bosom turn
For death too strongfor tearstoo proudly stern
When shall the lulling dews of peace descend
On hearts that cannot break and will not bend
Ah never neverthey are doomed to feel
Pains that no balm of heaven or earth can heal
To live in groans and yield their parting breath
Without a joy in lifeor hope in death
Yet for a while one living hope remains
That nerves each fibre and the soul sustains
One desperate hope whose agonizing throes
Are bitterer far than all the worst of woes
A hope of crime and horrors wild and strange
As demon thoughtsthat hope is thine Revenge
Twas this that gave oh Ellinor to thee
A strength to bear thy matchless misery
Though the hot blood ran boiling in her brain
And rolled a tide of fire through every vein
Though many a rushing voice of blighted bliss
Struck on her mental ears like adders hiss
That hope gave gloomy fierceness to her eye
Dashd down the tear repressd the unloading sigh
Fixed her wan quivering lip and steeled her breast
To crush the hearts that robbed her own of rest

She wound her way within a heavy shade
Of arching boughs in broadspread leaves arrayed
Which clustering close and thick shut out the light
And tinged with black the shadowy robe of night
Save here and there a melancholy spark
Of flickering moonshine glimmered through the dark
Cheerless and dim as when upon a pall
Through suffering tears the looks of sorrow fall
But opening farther on on either side
A wider space the severing trees divide
And longer gleams upon the pathway meet
And the soft grass is wet beneath her feet
And now emerging from the darksome shade
She pressed the silken carpet of the glade
Beyond the green within its western close
A little vinehung leafy arbor rose
Where the pale lustre of the moony flood
Dimmd the vermilliond woodbines scarlet bud
And glancing through the foliage fluttering round
In tiny circles gemmd the freckled ground
Beside the porch beneath the friendly screen
Of two tall trees a mossy bank was seen
And all around amid the silvery dew
The wildwood pansy reard her petals blue
And gold cups and the meadow cowslip red
Upon the evening air their odours shed

Unheeded all the groves deep gloom had been
Unseen the moonlight brightness of the green
In vain the streams blue burnish met her eye
Lovely its wave but passd unnoticed by
The airs of heaven had breathd around her brow
Their cooling sighsshe felt them notbut now
That lonely bower appeared and with a start
Convulsive shudders thrilld her throbbing heart
For there in days alas for ever gone
When loves young torch with beams of rapture shone
When she had felt her hearts impassioned swell
And almost deemd her Leon loved as well
There had she sat beneath the evening skies
Felt his warm kiss and heard his murmurd sighs
Hung on his breast caressing and carest
Her husband smiled and Ellinor was blest

And when his injured countrys rights to shield
Blazed his red banner on the battle field
There had she lingered in the shadows dim
And sat till morning watch and thought of him
And wept to think that she might not be there
His toils his dangers and his wounds to share
And when the foe had bowed beneath his brand
And to his home he led his conquering band
There she first caught his longexpected face
And sprung to smile and weep in his embrace

These scenes of bliss across her memory fled
Like lights that haunt the chambers of the dead
She saw the bower and read the image there
Of joys that had been and of woes that were
She clenchd her hand in agony and cast
A glance of tears upon it as she past
A look of weeping sorrowtwas the last
She checkd the gush of feeling turned her face
And faster sped along her hurried pace
No longer now from Leons lips were heard
The sigh of blissthe rapture breathing word
No longer now upon his features dwelt
The glance that sweetly thrillsthe looks that melt
No speaking gaze of fond attachment told
But all was dull and gloomy sad and cold
Yet he was kind or laboured to be kind
And strove to hide the workings of his mind
And cloakd his heart to soothe his wifes distress
Under a mask of tender gentleness
It was in vainfor ah how light and frail
To loves keen eye is falsehoods gilded veil
Sweet winning words may for a time beguile
Professions lull and oaths deceive a while
But soon the heart in vague suspicion tost
Must feel a void unfilled a something lost
Something scarce heeded and unprized till gone
Felt while unseen and tho unnoticed known
A hidden witchery a nameless charm
Too fine for actions and for words too warm
That passing all the worthless forms of art
Eludes the sense and only woos the heart
A hallowed spell by fond affection wove
The mute but matchless eloquence of love

    

Oh there were times when to my heart there came
All that the soul can feel or fancy frame
The summer party in the open air
When sunny eyes and cordial hearts were there
Where light came sparkling thro the greenwood eaves
Like mirthful eyes that laugh upon the leaves
Where every bush and tree in all the scene
In windkissd wavings shake their wings of green
And all the objects round about dispense
Reviving freshness to the awakened sense
The golden corslet of the humble bee
The antic kid that frolics round the lea
Or purple lanceflies circling round the place
On their light shards of green an airy race
Or squirrel glancing from the nutwood shade
An arch black eye half pleasd and half afraid
Or bird quick darting through the foliage dim
Or perched and twittering on the tendril slim
Or poised in ether sailing slowly on
With plumes that change and glisten in the sun
Like rainbows fading into mistand then
On the bright cloud renewed and changed again
Or soaring upward while his full sweet throat
Pours clear and strong a pleasurespeaking note
And sings in natures language wild and free
His song of praise for light and liberty

And when within with poetry and song
Music and books led the glad hours along
Worlds of the visioned minstrel fancywove
Tales of old time of chivalry and love
Or converse calm or witshafts sprinkled round
Like beams from gems too light and fine to wound
With spirits sparkling as the mornings sun
Light as the dancing wave he smiles upon
Like his own coursealas too soon to know
Bright suns may set in storms and gay hearts sink in wo

    




NIAGARA


I

Roar raging torrent and thou mighty river
Pour thy white foam on the valley below
Frown ye dark mountains and shadow for ever
The deep rocky bed where the wild rapids flow
The green sunny glade and the smooth flowing fountain
Brighten the home of the coward and slave
The flood and the forest the rock and the mountain
Rear on their bosoms the free and the brave

II

Nurslings of nature I mark your bold bearing
Pride in each aspect and strength in each form
Hearts of warm impulse and souls of high daring
Born in the battle and reard in the storm
The red levin flash and the thunders dread rattle
The rockriven wave and the war trumpets breath
The din of the tempest the yell of the battle
Nerve your steeled bosoms to danger and death

III

High on the brow of the Alps snowy towers
The mountain Swiss measures his rockbreasted moors
Oer his lone cottage the avalanche lowers
Round its rude portal the springtorrent pours
Sweet is his sleep amid peril and danger
Warm is his greeting to kindred and friends
Open his hand to the poor and the stranger
Stern on his foeman his sabre descends

IV

Lo where the tempest the dark waters sunder
Slumbers the sailor boy reckless and brave
Warmd by the lighting and lulled by the thunder
Fannd by the whirlwind and rockd on the wave
Wildly the winter wind howls round his pillow
Cold on his bosom the spray showers fall
Creaks the strained mast at the rush of the billow
Peaceful he slumbers regardless of all

V

Mark how the cheek of the warrior flushes
As the battle drum beats and the war torches glare
Like a blast of the north to the onset he rushes
And his widewaving falchion gleams brightly in air
Around him the deathshot of foemen are flying
At his feet friends and comrades are yielding their breath
He strikes to the groans of the wounded and dying
But the war cry he strikes with is conquest or death

VI

Then pour thy broad wave like a flood from the heavens
Each son that thou rearest in the battles wild shock
When the deathspeaking note of the trumpet is given
Will charge like thy torrent or stand like thy rock
Let his roof be the cloud and the rock be his pillow
Let him stride the rough mountain or toss on the foam
He will strike fast and well on the field or the billow
In triumph and glory for God and his home




SONG


Oh go to sleep my baby dear
 And I will hold thee on my knee
Thy mothers in her winding sheet
 And thou art all thats left to me
My hairs are white with grief and age
 Ive borne the weight of every ill
And I would lay me with my child
 But thou art left to love me still

Should thy false father see thy face
 The tears would fill his cruel ee
But he has scorned thy mothers wo
 And he shall never look on thee
But I will rear thee up alone
 And with me thou shalt aye remain
For thou wilt have thy mothers smile
 And I shall see my child again




SONG


Oh the tear is in my eye and my heart it is breaking
Thou hast fled from me Connor and left me forsaken
Bright and warm was our morning but soon has it faded
For I gave thee a true heart and thou hast betrayed it

Thy footsteps I followed in darkness and danger
From the home of my love to the land of the stranger
Thou wert mine through the tempest the blight and the burning
Could I think thou wouldst change when the morn was returning

Yet peace to thy heart though from mine it must sever
May she love thee as I loved alone and for ever
I may weep for thy loss but my faith is unshaken
And the heart thou hast widowed will bless thee in breaking




WRITTEN IN A LADYS ALBUM


Grant me I cried some spell of art
 To turn with all a lovers care
That spotless page my Evas heart
 And write my burning wishes there

But Love by faithless Laia taught
 How frail is womans holiest vow
Lookd down while grace attempered thought
 Sate serious on his baby brow

Go blot her album cried the sage
 There none but bards a place may claim
But womans hearts a worthless page
 Where every fool may write his name

Until by time or fate decayed
 That line and leaf shall never part
Ah who can tell how soon shall fade
 The lines of love from womans heart




LINES
TO A LADY ON HEARING HER SING CUSHLAMACHREE


Yes heaven protect thee thou gem of the ocean
 Dear land of my sires though distant thy shores
Ere my heart cease to love thee its latest emotion
 The last dying throbs of its pulse must be oer

And dark were the bosom and cold and unfeeling
 That tamely could listen unmoved at the call
When woman the warm soul of melody stealing
 Laments for her country and sighs oer its fall

Sing on gentle warbler the teardrop appearing
 Shall fall for the woes of the queen of the sea
And the spirit that breathes in the harp of green Erin
 Descending shall hail thee her Cushlamachree




LINES
WRITTEN ON LEAVING NEW ROCHELLE


Wheneer thy wandering footstep bends
 Its pathway to the Hermit tree
Among its cordial band of friends
 Sweet Mary wilt thou number me

Though all too few the hours have rolld
 That saw the stranger linger here
In memorys volume let them hold
 One little spot to friendship dear

I oft have thought how sweet twould be
 To steal the bird of Edens art
And leave behind a trace of me
 On every kind and friendly heart

And like the breeze in fragrance rolled
 To gather as I wander by
From every soul of kindred mould
 Some touch of cordial sympathy

Tis the best charm in lifes dull dream
 To feel that yet there linger here
Bright eyes that look with fond esteem
 And feeling hearts that hold me dear




HOPE


See through yon cloud that rolls in wrath
 One little star benignant peep
To light along their trackless path
 The wanderers of the stormy deep

And thus oh Hope thy lovely form
 In sorrows gloomy night shall be
The sun that looks through cloud and storm
 Upon a dark and moonless sea

When heaven is all serene and fair
 Full many a brighter gem we meet
Tis when the tempest hovers there
 Thy beam is most divinely sweet

The rainbow when the sun declines
 Like faithless friend will disappear
Thy light dear star more brightly shines
 When all is wail and weeping here

And though Auroras stealing beam
 May wake a morning of delight
Tis only thy consoling beam
 Will smile amid afflictions night




FRAGMENT


I

Tuscara thou art lovely now
 Thy woods that frownd in sullen strength
Like plumage on a giants brow
 Have bowed their massy pride at length
The rustling maize is green around
 The sheep is in the Congars bed
And clear the ploughmans whistlings sound
 Where warwhoops pealed oer mangled dead
Fair cots around thy breast are set
 Like pearls upon a coronet
And in Alugas vale below
The gilded grain is moving slow
Like yellow moonlight on the sea
Where waves are swelling peacefully
As beautys breast when quiet dreams
 Come tranquilly and gently by
When all she loves and hopes for seems
 To float in smiles before her eye

II

And hast thou lost the grandeur rude
 That made me breathless when at first
 Upon my infant sight you burst
The monarch of the solitude
 No there is yet thy turret rock
The watchtower of the skies the lair
 Of Indian Gods who in the shock
Of bursting thunders slumbered there
And trim thy bosom is arrayed
 In labours green and glittering vest
And yet thy forest locks of shade
 Shake stormy on that turret crest
Still hast thou left the rocks the floods
 And nature is the loveliest then
When first amid her caves and woods
 She feels the busy tread of men
When every tree and bush and flower
 Springs wildly in its native grace
Ere art exerts her boasted power
 That brightened only to deface

III

Yes thou art lovelier now than ever
 How sweet twould be when all the air
In moonlight swims along thy river
 To couch upon the grass and hear
Niagaras everlasting voice
 Far in the deep blue west away
That dreaming and poetic noise
 We mark not in the glare of day
Oh how unlike its torrentcry
 When oer the brink the tide is driven
As if the vast and sheeted sky
 In thunder fell from heaven

IV

Were I but there the daylight fled
 With that smooth air the stream the sky
And lying on that minstrel bed
 Of natures own embroidery
With those long tearful willows oer me
 That weeping fount that solemn light
With scenes of sighing tales before me
 And one green maiden grave in sight
How mournfully the strain would rise
 Of that true maid whose fate can yet
Draw rainy tears from stubborn eyes
 From lids that neer before were wet
She lies not here but that green grave
 Is sacred from the ploughand flowers
Snowdrops and valleylilies wave
 Amid the grass and other showers
Than those of heaven have fallen there




TO 


When that eye of light shall in darkness fall
And thy bosom be shrouded in deaths cold pall
When the bloom of that rich red lip shall fade
And thy head on its pillow of dust be laid

Oh then thy spirit shall see how true
Are the holy vows I have breathed to you
My form shall moulder thy grave beside
And in the blue heavens Ill seek my bride

Then well tell as we tread yon azure sphere
Of the woes we have known while lingering here
And our spirits shall joy that their pilgrimage oer
They have met in the heavens to sever no more




LINES


Day gradual fades in evening gray
 Its last faint beam hath fled
And sinks the suns declining ray
 In oceans wavy bed
So oer the loves and joys of youth
 Thy waves Indifference roll
So mantles round our days of truth
 That deathpool of the soul

Spreads oer the heavens the shadowy night
 Her dim and shapeless form
So human pleasures frail and light
 Are lost in passions storm
So fades the sunshine of the breast
 So passions dreamings fall
So friendships fervours sink to rest
 Oblivion shrouds them all




TO EVA


A beam upon the myrtle fell
 From dewy evenings purest sky
Twas like the glance I love so well
 Dear Eva from thy moonlight eye

I looked around the summer grove
 On every tree its lustre shone
For all had felt that look of love
 The silly myrtle deemed its own

Eva behold thine image there
 As fair as false thy glances fall
But who the worthless smile would share
 That sheds its light alike on all




TO A LADY
WITH A WITHERED VIOLET


Though fate upon this faded flower
 His withering hand has laid
Its odourd breath defies his power
 Its sweets are undecayed

And thus although thy warbled strains
 No longer wildly thrill
The memory of the song remains
 Its soul is with me still




BRONX


I sat me down upon a green bankside
 Skirting the smooth edge of a gentle river
Whose waters seemed unwillingly to glide
 Like parting friends who linger while they sever
Enforced to go yet seeming still unready
 Backward they wind their way in many a wistful eddy

Gray oer my head the yellowvested willow
 Ruffled its hoary top in the fresh breezes
Glancing in light like spray on a green billow
 Or the fine frostwork which young winter freezes
When first his power in infant pastime trying
Congeals sad autumns tears on the dead branches lying

From rocks around hung the loose ivy dangling
 And in the clefts sumach of liveliest green
Bright isingstars the little beach was spangling
 The goldcup sorrel from his gauzy screen
Shone like a fairy crown enchased and beaded
Left on some morn when light flashed in their eyes unheeded

The humbird shook his suntouched wings around
 The bluefinch carolld in the still retreat
The antic squirrel capered on the ground
 Where lichens made a carpet for his feet
Through the transparent waves the ruddy minkle
Shot up in glimmering sparks his red fins tiny twinkle

There were dark cedars with loose mossy tresses
 White powdered dogtrees and stiff hollies flaunting
Gaudy as rustics in their Mayday dresses
 Blue pelloret from purple leaves upslanting
A modest gaze like eyes of a young maiden
Shining beneath dropt lids the evening of her wedding

The breeze fresh springing from the lips of morn
 Kissing the leaves and sighing so to lose em
The winding of the merry locusts horn
 The glad spring gushing from the rocks bare bosom
Sweet sights sweet sounds all sights all sounds excelling
Oh twas a ravishing spot formed for a poets dwelling

And did I leave thy loveliness to stand
 Again in the dull world of earthly blindness
Pained with the pressure of unfriendly hands
 Sick of smooth looks agued with icy kindness
Left I for this thy shades were none intrude
To prison wandering thought and mar sweet solitude

Yet I will look upon thy face again
 My own romantic Bronx and it will be
A face more pleasant than the face of men
 Thy waves are old companions I shall see
A wellremembered form in each old tree
And hear a voice long loved in thy wild minstrelsy




SONG


Tis not the beam of her bright blue eye
Nor the smile of her lip of rosy dye
Nor the dark brown wreaths of her glossy hair
Nor her changing cheek so rich and rare
Oh these are the sweets of a fairy dream
The changing hues of an April sky
They fade like dew in the morning beam
Or the passing zephyrs odourd sigh

Tis a dearer spell that bids me kneel
Tis the heart to love and the soul to feel
Tis the mind of light and the spirit free
And the bosom that heaves alone for me
Oh these are the sweets that kindly stay
From youths gay morning to ages night
When beautys rainbow tints decay
Loves torch still burns with a holy light

Soon will the bloom of the fairest fade
And love will droop in the cheerless shade
Or if tears should fall on his wing of joy
It will hasten the flight of the laughing boy
But oh the light of the constant soul
Nor time can darken nor sorrow dim
Though wo may weep in lifes mingled bowl
Love still shall hover around its brim




TO SARAH


I

One happy year has fled Sall
 Since you were all my own
The leaves have felt the autumn blight
 The wintry storm has blown
We heeded not the cold blast
 Nor the winters icy air
For we found our climate in the heart
 And it was summer there

II

The summers sun is bright Sall
 The skies are pure in hue
But clouds will sometimes sadden them
 And dim their lovely blue
And clouds may come to us Sall
 But sure they will not stay
For theres a spell in fond hearts
 To chase their gloom away

III

In sickness and in sorrow
 Thine eyes were on me still
And there was comfort in each glance
 To charm the sense of ill
And were they absent now Sall
 Id seek my bed of pain
And bless each pang that gave me back
 Those looks of love again

IV

Oh pleasant is the welcome kiss
 When days dull round is oer
And sweet the music of the step
 That meets me at the door
Though worldly cares may visit us
 I reck not when they fall
While I have thy kind lips my Sall
 To smile away them all




THE AMERICAN FLAG


I

When Freedom from her mountain height
 Unfurled her standard to the air
She tore the azure robe of night
 And set the stars of glory there
She mingled with its gorgeous dyes
The milky baldric of the skies
And striped its pure celestial white
With streakings of the morning light
Then from his mansion in the sun
She called her eagle bearer down
And gave into his mighty hand
 The symbol of her chosen land

II

Majestic monarch of the cloud
 Who rearst aloft thy regal form
To hear the tempest trumpings loud
 And see the lightning lances driven
When strive the warriors of the storm
 And rolls the thunderdrum of heaven
Child of the sun to thee tis given
 To guard the banner of the free
To hover in the sulphur smoke
To ward away the battle stroke
And bid its blendings shine afar
Like rainbows on the cloud of war
 The harbingers of victory

III

Flag of the brave thy folds shall fly
 The sign of hope and triumph high
When speaks the signal trumpet tone
 And the long line comes gleaming on
Ere yet the lifeblood warm and wet
 Has dimmd the glistening bayonet
Each soldier eye shall brightly turn
 To where thy skyborn glories burn
And as his springing steps advance
 Catch war and vengeance from the glance
And when the cannonmouthings loud
 Heave in wild wreaths the battle shroud
And gory sabres rise and fall
Like shoots of flame on midnights pall
 Then shall thy meteor glances glow
And cowering foes shall shrink beneath
 Each gallant arm that strikes below
That lovely messenger of death

IV

Flag of the seas on ocean wave
 Thy stars shall glitter oer the brave
When death careering on the gale
 Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail
And frighted waves rush wildly back
 Before the broadsides reeling rack
Each dying wanderer of the sea
 Shall look at once to heaven and thee
And smile to see thy splendours fly
In triumph oer his closing eye

V

Flag of the free hearts hope and home
 By angel hands to valour given
The stars have lit the welkin dome
 And all thy hues were born in heaven
For ever float that standard sheet
 Where breathes the foe but falls before us
With Freedoms soil beneath our feet

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httpwwwgutenbergorgfundraisingdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
