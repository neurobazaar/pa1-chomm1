TOM SWIFT AND HIS AIR SCOUT




CHAPTER I

A SKY RIDE


Oh Tom is it really safe

A young ladyan exceedingly pretty young lady she could be
calledstood with one small gloved hand on the outstretched wing of
an aeroplane and looked up at a young man attired in a leather
furlined suit who sat in the cockpit of the machine just above her

Safe Mary repeated the pilot as he reached in under the hood of
the craft to make sure about one of the controls Why you ought to
know by this time that I wouldnt go up if it wasnt safe

Oh yes I know Tom It may be all right for you but Ive never been
up in this kind of airship before and I want to know if its safe for
me

The young man leaned over the edge of the padded cockpit and clasped
in his rather grimy hand the neatly gloved one of the young lady And
though the glove was new and fitted the hand perfectly there was no
attempt to withdraw it Instead the young lady seemed to be very glad
indeed that her hand was in such safe keeping

Mary exclaimed the young man if it wasnt safeas safe as a
churchI wouldnt dream of taking you up and at the mention of
church Mary Nestor blushed just the least bit Or perhaps it was that
the prospective excitement of the moment caused the blood to surge into
her cheeks Have it as you will

Come Mary youre not going to back out the last minute are you
asked Tom Swift Everything is all right Ive made a trial flight
and youve seen me come down as safely as a bird You promised to go
up with me I wont go very high if you dont like it but my
experience has been that once youre off the ground it doesnt make
any difference how high you go Youll find it very fascinating So
skip along to the house and Mrs Baggert will help you get into your
togs

Shall I have to wear all those thingssuch as you have on asked
Mary blushing again

Well youll be more comfortable in a furlined leather suit
asserted Tom And if it does make you look like an Eskimo why Im
sure it will be very becoming Not that you dont look nice now he
hastened to assure Miss Nestor but an aviation suit will be
verywell fetching I should say

If I could be sure it would fetch me back safe Tom

Thatll do Thatll do laughed the young aviator One joke like
that is enough in a morning It was pretty good though Now go on in
and tog up

Youre sure its safe Tom

Positive Trot along now I want to fix a wire and

Oh is anything broken and the girl who had started away from the
aeroplane turned back again

No not broken Its only a little auxiliary dingus I put on to make
it easier to read the barograph but I think Ill go back to the old
system Nothing to do with flying at all except to tell how high up
one is

Thats just what I dont care to know Tom said Mary Nestor with a
smile If I could imagine I was sailing along only about ten feet in
the air I wouldnt mind so much

Flying at that height would be the worst sort of danger You leave it
to me Mary I wont take you up above the clouds on this sky ride
though later Im sure youll want to try that This is only a little
flight Youve been promising long enough to take a trip with me and
now I believe youre trying to back out

No really Im not Tom Only at the last minute the machine looks
so small and frail and the sky is sobig

She glanced up and seemed to shiver just a trifle

Dont be thinking of those things Mary laughed Tom Swift Trot
along and get ready The motor never worked better and we may break a
few speed records this morning No traffic cops to stop us either as
there might be if we were in an auto

There you go Mary exclaimed Tom as if struck with a new thought
Youve ridden in an auto with me many a time and you never were a bit
afraid though we were in more danger than well be this morning

Danger Tom in an auto How

Why danger of a wheel collapsing as we were going full speed or the
steering knuckle breaking and sending us into a tree danger of running
into a stone wall or a ditch danger of some one running into us or of
us running into some one else There isnt one of these dangers on a
sky ride

No said Mary slowly But theres the danger of falling

One against twenty Thats the safety margin And if we do fall it
will be like landing in a feather bed There dont wait any longer Go
and get ready

Mary sighed and then seeming to summon her nerve to her aid she
smiled brightly waved her hand to Tom and hastened toward his home
where Mrs Baggert the matronly housekeeper was waiting to help the
girl attire herself in a flyingsuit of leather

Mary Nestor who had a very warm place in the heart of Tom Swift had
as he stated some time since promised to take a trip in the air with
the young inventor But she had kept putting it off for one reason or
another until Tom began to despair of ever getting her to accompany
him Today however when she had called to inquire about his father
who had been slightly ill Tom had after the social visit insisted on
the promise being kept

He had his mechanic get out one of the safest though a speedy double
machine and with Mary to watch Tom had taken a trial flight just to
show her how easy it was It was not the first time she had seen him
take to the air but now she watched with different emotions for she
was vitally interested

Tom had sailed down from aloft making a landing in the aviation field
he had constructed near his home and then he had insisted that Mary
should keep her promise to take a sky ride with him

Dont be too long now called Tom to the girl as she hurried toward
the house Never mind about your hair or whether your hats on
straight Youre going to wear a cap anyhow and tuck your hair up
under that Its hot down here but it will be cold up above so tell
Mrs Baggert to see that youre warmly dressed

All right and gaily she waved her hand to him Now that she had made
her decision and was really going up she was not half so frightened
as she had been in the contemplation of it

As Tom climbed out of the machine to give it a careful inspection
though he was certain there was nothing wrong an aged colored man
shuffled toward him

Yoyoll be mighty careful ob Miss Nestor now wont yo Massa
Tom asked the man

Of course I will Eradicate was the young inventors answer

Case we aint got many laik her no mo an dats de truf Massa Tom
went on the old man So be mighty careful laik

Thats what I will Rad And while Im up in the air dont you and
Koku have any trouble

Ho Trouble wif dat onery nocount giant I guess not and the
colored man limped off highly indignant

Satisfied from an inspection of his machine that it was as nearly
mechanically perfect as it was possible to be Tom Swift finished his
trip around it and stood near the big propeller waiting for Mary
Nestor to reappear Presently she did so and Tom gaily waved his hand
to her

Youre a picture he cried as he saw how particularly fetching she
looked in the aviators costume which was like his own Because of the
danger of entanglement Miss Nestor had doffed her skirts and wore the
costume of all aviatorsmen and women

I wish I had my camera cried Tom You lookstunning

I hope that isnt any comment on how Im going to feel if we have to
make aforced landing I believe you call it she retorted

Oh Ill take care of that exclaimed Tom Now up you go and well
start and he helped her to climb into the padded seat of the cockpit
behind where he was to sit

Oh Tom Dont be in such a hurry expostulated Mary Let me get my
breath

No laughed the young inventor If I did you might back out Get
in fasten the strap around you and sit still Thats all you have to
do Dont be afraid Ill be very careful And dont try to yell at me
to go slower or lower once were up in the air

Why not Mary wanted to know as she settled herself in her seat

Because I cant very well hear you or talk to you The motor makes so
much noise you know We can do a little talking through this speaking
tube and he indicated one but it isnt very satisfactory So if you
have anything to say

In the language of the poets interrupted Mary if I have words to
spill prepare to spill them now Well I havent Now Im here go
ahead I shall probably be too frightened to talk anyhow

Oh no you wontafter the first little sensation Tom assured her
Youll be crazy about it Come on Jackson he called to the
mechanician Start the ball rolling

Tom was in his place his goggles and cap well down over his face and
he was adjusting the switch as the mechanic prepared to spin the
propellers

Suddenly a man came running from the Swift house waving his arms not
unlike the blades of an aircraft propeller he also shouted but Tom
whose ears were covered with his fur cap could not hear However
Jackson did and stopped whirling the blades turning about to see what
was wanted

Why its Mr Damon exclaimed Tom as he caught sight of the excited
man Hello whats the matter the youth asked pulling aside one
flap of his headcovering so he might hear the answer

Tom Wait a minute Bless my mouse trap exclaimed Mr Damon I want
to speak to you He was panting from his run across the field I just
got to your housesaw your fatherhe said you were going up with Miss
Nestor butbless my dog biscuit

Cant stop now Mr Damon answered Tom with a laugh I have only
just succeeded by hard work in getting Mary to a point where she has
consented to take a sky ride If I stop now shell back out and Ill
never get her in again See you when I come back and Tom pulled the
covering over his ear once more

But Tom bless my shoe laces This is important

Sos this answered Tom with a grin He saw by the motion of Mr
Damons lips what the latter had said

Around swung the propeller blades The gasoline vapor in the cylinders
was being compressed

Contact called Tom sharply as he pressed the switch to give the
igniting spark at the proper moment The mechanic had stepped back out
of the way in case there should be a premature starting of the
powerful engine in which event the blades would have cut him to pieces

Wait Tom Wait This is very important Bless my collar button Tom
Swift but this is

Bang Bang Bang

With a series of explosions like those of a machine gun the motor
started and further talk was out of the question Tom turned on more
gas The propellers became almost invisible blades of light and shadow
and the aeroplane began moving over the grassy field The mechanic had
sprung out of the way pulling Mr Damon with him

Come back Come back Wait a minute Tom Swift Bless my pansy
blossoms I want to tell you something cried the little man

But Tom Swift was away and out of hearing He had started on his sky
ride with Mary Nestor




CHAPTER II

A NEW IDEA


Any one who has taken a flight in an aeroplane or gone up in a balloon
will know exactly how Mary Nestor felt on this her first sky ride of
any distance For a moment as she looked over the side of the machine
she had a distinct impression not that she was going up but that some
one had pulled the earth down from beneath her and at the same time
given her a shove off into space Such is the first sensation of going
aloft Then the rush of air all about her the slightly swaying motion
of the craft and the vibration caused by the motor took her attention
But the sensation of the earth dropping away from beneath her remained
with Mary for some time

This sensation is much greater in a balloon than in an aeroplane for a
balloon unless there is a strong wind blowing goes straight up while
an aeroplane ascends on a long slant and always into the teeth of the
wind to take advantage of its lifting power on the underside of the
planes The reason for this sensationthat of the earths dropping
down instead of ones feeling what really happens that one is
ascendingis because there are no objects by which comparison can be
made If one starts off on the earths surface at slow or at great
speed one passes stationary objectshouses posts trees and the
likeand judges the speed by the rapidity with which these are left
behind

Going up is unlike this There is nothing to pass One simply cleaves
the air and only as it rushes past can one be sure of movement And as
the air is void of color and form there is no sensation of passing
anything

So Mary Nestor as she shot into the air with Tom Swift had a
sensation as though the earth were dropping from beneath her For a
moment she felt as though she were in some vast voidfloating in
spaceand she had a great fear Then she calmed herself She looked at
Tom sitting in front of her Of course all she could see was his back
but it looked to be a very sturdy back indeed and he sat there in the
aircraft as calmly as though in a chair on the ground Then Mary took
courage and ceased to grasp the sides of the cockpit with a grip that
stiffened all her muscles She was beginning to find herself

On and on and up and up went Mary and Tom in this the girls first
big sky ride The earth below seemed farther and farther away The
wide green fields became little emerald squares and the houses like
those in a toy Noahs ark

Down below Mr Wakefield Damon who had hurried over from his home in
Waterfield to see Tom Swift gazed aloft at the fast disappearing
aeroplane and its passengers

Bless my coal bin cried the eccentric man but Tom is in a hurry
this morning Too bad he couldnt have stopped and spoken to me It
might have been greatly to his advantage But I suppose I shall have to
wait

You want to see Master asked a voice behind Mr Damon and turning
he beheld a veritable giant

Yes Koku I did Mr Damon answered and he did not appear at all
surprised at the sight of the towering form beside him I wanted to
see Tom most particularly But I shall have to wait Ill go in and
talk to Mr Swift

Yaas an I go talk to Radicate said the giant Him diggin up
ground where Master told me to make garden Radicate not strong enough
for dat

Huh theres trouble as soon as those two get to disputing mused Mr
Damon as he went toward the house

Meanwhile Mary was beginning to enjoy herself The sensation of moving
rapidly through the air in a machine as skillfully guided as was the
one piloted by Tom Swift was delightful Up and up they went and then
suddenly Mary felt a lurch and the plane which was now about a
thousand feet high seemed to slip to one side

Mary screamed and began reaching for the buckle of the safety belt
that fastened her to her seat She saw that something unusual had
occurred for Tom was working frantically at the mechanism in front of
him

But in spite of this he seemed aware that Mary was in danger not so
much perhaps from what might happen to the machine as what she might
do in her terror

Oh Oh cried the girl and Tom heard her above the terrific noise of
the motor for she was speaking with her lips close to the tube that
served as a sort of intercommunicating telephone for the craft Oh
we are falling Im going to jump

Sit still Sit still for your life cried Tom Swift Ill save you
all right Only sit still Dont jump

Mary her red cheeks white sank back and the young inventor redoubled
his efforts at the controls and other mechanisms

And that Tom was perfectly qualified to make a safe landing even with
engine trouble Mary Nestor well knew Those of you who have read the
previous books of this series know it also but for the benefit of my
new readers I shall state that this was by no means Toms first ride
in an aeroplane

He had operated and built gasoline engines ever since he was about
sixteen years old As related in the initial volume of this series
entitled Tom Swift and His Motorcycle he became possessed of this
machine after it had started to climb a tree with Mr Damon on board
After that experience the eccentric manblessing everything he could
think ofhad no liking for the speedy motorcycle and sold it to Tom at
a low price

That was the beginning of a friendship between the two and also
started Tom on his career as an inventor and a possessor of many
gasoline craft For he was not content with merely riding the repaired
motorcycle He made improvements on it

Tom lived with his father in the town of Shopton their home being
looked after since the death of Mrs Swift by Mrs Baggert Mr
Wakefield Damon lived in the neighboring town of Waterfield and spent
much time at Toms home often going on trips with him in various
vehicles of the land sea or air

As related in the various volumes of this series Tom was not content
to remain on earth He built a speedy motor boat and then secured an
airship following that with a submarine He also made an electric
runabout that was the speediest car on the road Sending wireless
messages having thrilling experiences among the diamond makers
journeying to the caves of ice and making perilous trips in his sky
racer took up part of the young inventors time

With his electric rifle he did some wonderful shooting and in the
City of Gold made some strange discoveries part of the fortune he
secured enabling him to build his sky racer It was in a land of giants
that Tom was made captive but he succeeded in escaping and brought
two giants of whom Koku was one away with him

Following this achievement Tom invented a wizard camera and a great
searchlight which with his giant cannon was purchased by the United
States Government Work on his phototelephone and his aerial warship
the problem of digging a big tunnel and then traveling to the land of
wonders kept Tom Swift very busy and he had just completed a
wonderful piece of work when the present story opens

This last achievement was the perfecting of a machine to aid in the
great World War and you will find the details set down in the volume
which immediately precedes this Tom Swift and His War Tank it is
called and in that is related how he not only invented a marvelous
machine but succeeded in keeping its secret from the plotters who
tried to take it from him In this Tom was helped by the inspiration of
Mary Nestor whom he hoped some day to marry and by Ned Newton a
chum who though no inventor himself could admire one

Ned and Tom had been chums a long while but Ned inclined more to
financial and office matters than to machinery At times he had managed
affairs for Tom and helped him finance projects Ned was now an
important bank official and since the United States had entered the
war had had charge of some Red Cross work as well as Liberty Bond
campaigns

Somehow as she sat there in the craft which seemed disabled Mary
Nestor could not help thinking of Toms many activities in some of
which she had shared

Oh if he falls now and is killed she thought Oh what will
happen to us

Its all right Mary Dont worry Its all right cried Tom through
the speaking tube

Whats that I cant hear you very well she called back

No wonder with the racket this motor is making he answered Why
cant something be done so you can talk in an aeroplane as well as in a
balloon Thats an idea If I could tell you what was the matter now
you wouldnt be a bit frightened for it isnt anything But as it
is

What are you saying Tom I cant hear you cried Mary still much
frightened

I say its all rightdont get scared And dont jump Tom shouted
until his ears buzzed Its all nonsensehaving a motor making so
much noise one cant talk he went on irritatedly

A strange idea had come to the young inventor but there was no time to
think of it now Mentally he registered a vow to take up this idea and
work on it as soon as possible But just now the aeroplane needed all
his attention

As he had told Mary there was really nothing approaching any great
danger But it was rather an anxious moment If Tom had been alone he
would have thought little of it but with Mary along he felt a double
responsibility

What had happened was that the craft had suddenly gone into an air
pocket or partial vacuum and there had been a sudden fall and a slide
slip In trying to stop this too quickly Tom had broken one of his
controls and he was busily engaged in putting an auxiliary one in
place and trying to reassure Mary at the same time

But its mighty hard trying to do that through a speaking tube with a
motor making a noise like a boiler factory mused the young inventor
Tom worked quickly and to good purpose In a few moments though to
Mary they seemed like hours the machine was again gliding along on a
level keel and Tom breathed more easily

And now for my great idea he told himself

But it was some time before he could give his attention to that




CHAPTER III

THE BIG OFFER


Working with all the skill he possessed Tom had got the aeroplane in
proper working order again As has been said the accident was a
trivial one and had he been alone or with an experienced aviator he
would have thought little of it Then very likely he would have
volplaned to earth and made the repairs there But he did not want to
frighten Mary Nestor so he fixed the control while gliding along and
made light of it Thus his passenger was reassured

Are we all right asked Mary through the tube as they sailed along

Right as a fiddle answered Tom shouting through the same means of
communication

Whats that about a riddle asked Mary in surprise at his seeming
flippancy at such a time

I didnt say anything about a riddleI said we are as fit as a
fiddle cried Tom Never mind No use trying to talk with the racket
this motor makes and it isnt the noisiest of its kind either Ill
tell you when we get down Do you like it

Yes I like it better than I did at first answered Mary for she had
managed to understand the last of Toms questions Then he sailed a
little higher circled about and a little later not to get Mary too
tired and anxious he headed for his landing field

Ill take you home in the auto he cried to his passenger We could
go up to your house this wayin styleif there was a field near by
large enough to land in But there isnt So it will have to be a
plain everyday auto

Thats good enough for me said Mary Though this trip is
wonderfulglorious Ill go again any time you ask me

Well Ill ask you said Tom And when I do maybe it wont be so
hard to hold a conversation It will be more like this and he shut
off the motor and began to glide gently down The quiet succeeding the
terrific noise of the motor exhaust was almost startling and Tom and
Mary could converse easily without using the tube

Then followed the landing on the soft springy turf a little glide
over the ground and the machine came to a halt while mechanics ran
out of the hangar to take charge of it

Ill just go in and change these togs said Mary as she alighted and
looked at her leather costume

No dont advised Tom You look swell in em Keep em on Theyre
yours and youll need em when we go up again Here comes the auto
Ill take you right home in it Keep the aviation suit on

I wonder what Mr Damon could have wanted remarked Tom as he drove
Mary along the country road

He seemed very much excited she replied

Oh he almost always is that wayblessing everything he can think of
You know that But this time it was different Ill admit I hope
nothing is the matter I might have stopped and spoken to him but I
was afraid if I did youd back out and wouldnt come for a sky ride

Well I might have But now that Ive had one even with an accident
thrown in Ill go any time you ask me Tom and Mary smiled at the
young inventor

Shucks that wasnt a real accident he laughed But I do wonder
what Mr Damon wanted

Better go back and find out Tom advised Mary as they stopped in
front of her house

Oh I want to come in and talk to you Havent had a chance for a good
talk today that motor made such a racket

No go along now but come back and see me this afternoon if you like

I do like all right And I suppose Mr Damon will be fussing until he
sees me Well glad you liked your first ride in the air Marythat
is the first one of any account for Mary had been in an aeroplane
before though only up a little waya sort of grasscutting stunt
Tom called it

Waving farewell to the pretty girl the young aviator turned the auto
about and speeded for his home and the shops adjoining it His father
had not been well of late and Tom was a bit anxious about him

Mr Damon may bother him though he wouldnt mean to thought Tom
He seemed to have his mind filled with some new idea I wonder if it
is anything like mine No it couldnt be Well Ill soon find out
and putting his foot on the accelerator Tom sent the machine along at
a pace that soon brought him within sight of his home

Is father all right he asked Mrs Baggert who was out on the front
porch as though waiting for him

Oh yes Tom hes all right the housekeeper answered

Is Mr Damon with him

No

He hasnt gone home has he

No hes around somewhere But some one else is with your father Some
visitors

Any relations

No strangers They came to see you and theyre rather impatient I
came out to see if you were in sight Your father sent me

Are they bothering himtalking business that I ought to attend to
when hes ill That mustnt be

Well I suppose it is business that the strangers are talking over
with your father Tom said Mrs Baggert for I heard sums of money
spoken of But your father seems to be all right only a trifle anxious
that you should come

Well Im here now and Ill attend to things Where are the strangers
and who are they

I dont know answered the housekeeper I never saw them before but
theyre in the library with your father Do you think theyll stay to
dinner If you do Ill have Eradicate or Koku catch and kill a
chicken

If you let one do it dont tell the other about it said Tom with a
laugh or youll have a chicken race around the yard that will make
the visitors sit up and take notice

There was great rivalry between Eradicate Sampson the aged colored
man and Koku the giant and they were continually disputing Each one
loved and served Tom in his own way and there was jealousy between
them Koku the giant Tom had brought with him from the land where the
young inventor had been made captive was a big powerful man and
could do things the aged colored servant could not attempt But Rad
as he was often called and his mule Boomerang had long been fixtures
on the Swift homestead But old age crept on apace with Eradicate
though he hated to admit it and Koku did many things the colored man
had formerly attended to and Rad was always on the lookout not to be
supplanted Hence Toms warning to Mrs Baggert about letting the two
be entrusted with the same mission of catching a chicken for the pot

Better get the fowl yourself and say nothing to either of them about
it Tom advised the housekeeper Mr Damon will stay to dinner as he
always does when he comes and as its near twelve now and as I may be
delayed talking business to these strangers youd better get up a
bigger meal than usual

I will Tom promised Mrs Baggert And then the young inventor
having seen that one of the men took the automobile to the garage went
into the house

Oh here you are was his fathers greeting as he came out into the
hall from the library Ive been waiting anxiously for you my boy I
couldnt think what was keeping you

Oh I had a little trouble with the air machinenothing serious

A moment later Tom was standing before two welldressed
prosperouslooking business men who smiled pleasantly at him

Mr Thomas Swift interrogated one the elder as he held out his
hand

Thats my name answered Tom pleasantly

Im Peton Gale and this gentleman is Boland Ware went on the man
who had taken Toms hand Im president and hes treasurer of the
Universal Flying Machine Company of New York

Oh yes said Tom as he shook hands with Mr Ware I have heard of
your concern You are doing a lot of government work are you not

Yes war orders And were up to our neck in them This war is going
to be almost as much fought in the air as on the ground Mr Swift

I can well believe that agreed Tom Wont you have a chair

Well we didnt come to stay long said Mr Gale with a laugh which
somehow or other grated on Tom and seemed to him insincere Our
business is such a rushing one that we dont spend much time anywhere
To get down to brass tacks we have come to see you to put a certain
proposition before you Mr Swift You are open to a business
proposition arent you

Oh yes answered Tom Thats what Im here for

I thought so Well now Ill tell you in brief what we want and
then Mr Ware our treasurer can elaborate on it and give you facts
and figures about which I never bother myself I attend to the
executive end and leave the details to others and again came that
laugh which Tom did not like

You came here to make me an offer asked the young inventor
wondering to which of his many machines the visitors had reference

Yes went on Mr Gale we came here to make you a big offer In
short Mr Swift we want you to work for our company and we are
willing to pay you ten thousand dollars a year for the benefit of your
advice and your inventive abilities Ten thousand dollars a year Do
you accept




CHAPTER IV

MR DAMONS WHIZZER


Characteristic it was of Tom Swift that he did not seem at all
surprised at what most young men would call a liberal offer Certainly
not many youths of Toms age would be sought out by a big manufacturing
concern and offered ten thousand dollars a year right off the reel
as Ned Newton expressed it later But Tom only smiled and shook his
head in negation

What cried Mr Gale you mean you wont accept our offer

I cant answered Tom

You cant exclaimed the treasurer Mr Ware Oh I see Mr Gale a
word with you Excuse us a moment he added to Tom and his father

The two men consulted in a corner of the library for a moment and
then with smiles on their faces once more turned toward the young
inventor

Well perhaps you are right Tom Swift said Mr Gale Of course we
recognize your talents and ability but you cannot blame us for trying
to get talent as well as material for our airships in the cheapest
market But we are not hidebound nor sticklers for any set sum Well
make that offer fifteen thousand dollars a year if you will sign a
fiveyear contract and agree that we shall have first claim on anything
and everything you may patent or invent in that time Now how does
that strike you Fifteen thousand dollars a yearpaid weekly if you
wish and our Mr Ware here has a form of contract which can be fixed
up and signed within ten minutes if you agree

Well I dont like to be disagreeable said Tom with a smile but
really as I said before I cant accept your very kind offer I may
say liberal offer I appreciate that

You cant accept cried Mr Gale

Are you sure you dont mean wont asked Mr Ware in a half growl

You may call it that if you like replied Tom a bit coolly for he
did not like the others tone Only as I say I cannot accept I have
other plans

Oh you began the brusk treasurer but Mr Gale the president of
the Universal Flying Machine Company stopped his associate with a
warning look

Just a moment Mr Swift begged the president Dont be hasty We
are prepared to make you a last and final offer and I do not believe
you can refuse it

Well I certainly will not refuse it without hearing it said Tom
with a smile he meant to make goodnatured Yet truth to tell he did
not at all like the two visitors There was something about them that
aroused his antagonism and he said later that even if they had offered
him a sum which he felt he ought not in justice to himself and his
father refuse he would have felt a distaste in working for a company
represented by the twain

This is our offer said Mr Gale and he spoke in a pompous manner
which seemed to say If you dont take it why it will be the worse
for you He looked at his treasurer for a confirmatory nod and
receiving it went on We are prepared to offer and pay you and will
enter into such a contract with the stipulation about the inventions
that I mentioned beforewe are prepared to pay youtwenty thousand
dollars a year Now what do you say to that Tom Swift

Twentythousanddollarsayear repeated Mr Gale unctuously rolling
the words off his tongue Twentythousanddollarsayear Think of
it

I am thinking of it said Tom Swift gently and I thank you for your
offer It is indeed very generous But I must give you the same
answer I cannot accept

Tom exclaimed his aged father

Mr Swift exclaimed the two visitors

Tom smiled and shook his head

Oh I know very well what I am saying and what I am turning down he
said But I simply cannot accept I have other plans I am sorry you
have had your trip for nothing he added to the visitors but
really I must refuse

Is that your final answer asked Mr Gale

Yes

Dont you want to take a day or two to think it over asked the
treasurer Dont be hasty Remember that very few young men can
command that salary and I may say you will find us liberal in other
ways You would have some time to yourself

That is what I most need returned Tom Time to myself No thank
you gentlemen I cannot accept

Be careful warned Mr Gale and it sounded as though there might be
a threat in his voice This is our last offer and your last chance
We will not renew this If you do not accept our twenty thousand
dollars now you will never get it again

I realize that said Tom and I am prepared to take the consequences

Very well then said Mr Gale There seems nothing for us to do
Mr Ware but to go back to New York I bid you goodday and he bowed
stiffly to Tom I hope you will not regret your refusal of our offer

I hope so myself said Tom lightly

When the visitors had gone Mr Swift turned toward his son and
shaking his head remarked

Of course you know your own business best Tom Yet I cannot but feel
you have made a mistake

How asked Tom By not taking that money I can easily make that in
a year with an idea I have in mind for an improvement on an airship
And your new electric motor will soon be ready for the market Besides
we dont really need the money

No not now Tom but there is no telling when we may said Mr
Swift slowly This big war has made many changes and things that
brought us in a good income before hardly sell at all now

Oh dont worry Dad We still have a few shots left in the lockerin
other words the bank Im expecting Ned Newton over any moment now to
give us the annual statement of our account and then well know where
we stand Im not afraid from the money end Our business has done
well and it is going to do better I have a new idea

Thats all very well Tom said Mr Swift who seemed oppressed by
something As you say money isnt everything and I know we shall
always have enough to live on But there is something about those two
men I do not like They were very angry at your refusal of their offer
I could see that Tom I dont want to be a croaker but I think youll
have to watch out for those men Theyre going to be your enemiesyour
rivals in the airship field and Mr Swift shook his head dolefully

Well rivalry when its clean and above board is the spice of trade
and invention returned Tom lightly Im not afraid of that

No but it may be unfair and underhand said Mr Swift I think it
would have been better Tom to have accepted their offer Twenty
thousand a year clear money is a good sum

Yes but I may make twice that with something that occurred to me only
a little while ago Forget about those men Dad and Ill tell you my
new idea But wait I want Mr Damon to hear it too Where is he

He was here a little while ago He went out when those two men came
and

At that moment from the garden at the side of the library the sound
of voices in dispute could be heard

Now yo all gwan way from yeah exclaimed some one who could be
none other than Eradicate Sampson Whut fo yo all want to clutter up
dish yeah place fo Massa Tom said I was to do de garden wuk an Ise
gwine to do it Gwan way Giant

Ho You want me to get out spose you put me black face cried a
big voice that of Koku the giant

There they go At it again cried Tom with a smile Might have known
if I told Rad to do anything that Koku would be jealous Well Ill
have to go out now and give that giant something to do that will tax
his strength

But as Tom was about to leave the room another voice was heard in the
garden

Now boys be nice said some one soothingly The garden is large
enough for you both to work in Rad you begin at the lower end and
spade toward the middle Koku you begin at the upper end and work
down Whoever gets to the middle first will win

Ha Den Ill show dat giant some spade wuk as is spade wuk cried the
colored man Garden wuk is mah middle name

Be careful Rad laughed Mr Damon for he it was who was trying to
act as peacemaker Remember that Koku is very strong

Yas sah He may be strong but hes clumsy chuckled Eradicate You
watch me beat him

Ho Black man get stuck in mud challenged Koku I show him

Then there was silence and Tom and his father looking out saw the
two disputants beginning to spade the soil while Mr Damon satisfied
that he had for the time being stopped a quarrel turned toward the
house

I was just coming to look for you said Tom Sorry I had to go off
in such a hurry and leave you but I had promised to take Mary for a
ride and as it was her first one for a distance I didnt want her to
back out

Thats all right Tom thats all right said Mr Damon genially
Ladies first every time But I do want to see you and its about
something important

No trouble I hope queried Tom for the manner of the eccentric man
was rather grave

Trouble Oh no Bless my frying pan no trouble Tom In fact it may
be the other way about Tom I have an idea and there may be millions
in it Thats itmillions

Good cried the young inventor Might as well bite off a big lump
while youre at it So you have a new idea Well I have myself but
Ill listen to yours first What is it Mr Damon

Its a new kind of airship Tom I havent got it all worked out yet
but I can give you a rough outline On my way over I got to thinking
about balloons aeroplanes and the like and it occurred to me that the
present principles are all wrong

So I evolved a new type of machine Im going to call it the Damon
Whizzer Maybe Demon Whizzer would be more appropriate but we wont
decide on that now Anyhow its going to be a whizzer and I want to
talk to you about it There is an entirely new principle of elevation
and propulsion involved in my Whizzer and I

At that moment there came a crash and clatter of steel and wood from
the garden out of sight of which Tom and Mr Damon had walked while
talking Then followed a jangle of words

Theyre at it again cried Tom as he ran toward the side of the
house I guess its a fight this time




CHAPTER V

TOMS PROJECT


Curious was the sight that met the gaze of Tom Swift and Mr Wakefield
Damon as they rounded the corner of the house and looked into the newly
spaded garden There stood the giant Koku holding aloft in the air
by one hand the form of the struggling colored man Eradicate Sampson
And Eradicate was vainly trying to get at his enemy and rival but was
prevented by the longdistance hold the giant had on him

Yo let me go now Yo let me go big man cried Eradicate Ef yo
dont Ill bust yo wide open dats whut Ill do An sides Ill
tell Massa Tom on yo dats whut Ill do

Ho You tellI let you fall threatened Koku

His threat was dire enough for such was his size and strength that he
held the colored man nearly nine feet from the ground and a fall from
that distance would seriously jar Eradicate if it did nothing else
The colored mans eyes opened wide as he heard what Koku said and then
he cried

Let me down Let me down an I wont say nuffin

An you let me scatter dirt asked Koku for such was the giants
idea of working in the garden

Yes yo kin scatter de dirt seben ways from Sunday fo all I keers
conceded Eradicate Then as he was lowered to the ground he and the
giant turned and saw Mr Damon and Tom approaching

Whats wrong asked the young inventor

Scuse me Massa Tom began Eradicate but didnt yo tell me to
spade de garden

I guess I did admitted Tom Swift

An you tell me helpyes questioned Koku

Well I thought it would be a little too much for you Rad said Tom
gently I thought perhaps youd like help

Hu Not him anyhow declared the colored man in great disgust When
I git so old dat I caint spade a garden den me an Boomerang weall
gwine to die dats all I got to say I was aspadin my part ob de
garden Massa Tom same laik Mr Damon done tole me to an dish yeah
big mess ob bones steps on my side ob de middle an

Him too slow Koku scatter dirt twice times so fast declared the
giant whose English was not much better than Eradicates

Yes I see said Tom You are so strong Koku that you finished
your part before Eradicate did Well it was good of you to want to
help him

At this the giant grinned at his rival

At the same time went on Tom winking an eye at Mr Damon
Eradicate knows a little more about garden work on account of having
done it so many years

Ha Whut I tell yo Giant boasted the colored man It was his turn
to smile

And so went on Tom judicially I guess Ill let Rad finish spading
the garden and you Koku can come and help me lift some heavy engine
parts Mr Damon wants to explain something to me

Ha Nothing what so heavy Koku not lift boasted the giant

Go on Lift yosef way from heah muttered Eradicate as he picked
up his dropped spade And then with a smile of satisfaction he fell
to work in the mellow soil while Tom led Koku to one of the shops where
he set him to lifting heavy motor parts about in order to get at a
certain machine that was stored away in the back of one of the rooms

That will keep him busy said the young inventor And now Mr
Damon I can listen to you Do you really think you have a new idea in
airships

I really think so Tom My Whizzer is bound to revolutionize travel in
the air Let me tell you what I mean Now cast your mind back How many
ways are now used to propel an airship or a dirigible balloon through
the air How many ways

Two as far as I know said Tom At least there are only two that
have proved to be practical

Exactly said Mr Damon One with the propeller or propellers in
front and that is the tractor type The other has the propeller in the
rear and that is the pusher type Both good as far as they go but I
have something better

What asked Tom with a smile

Its a Whizzer said the eccentric man Bless my gold tooth but
that is the best name I can think of for it And really the propeller
Im thinking of inventing does whiz around

But are you going to use a tractor or pusher type Tom wanted to know

Its a combination of both answered Mr Damon As it is now Tom
you have to get an aeroplane in pretty speedy motion before it will
rise from the ground dont you

Yes of course Thats the principle on which an aeroplane rises and
keeps aloft by its speed in the air As soon as that speed stops it
begins to fall or volplane as we call it

Exactly Now instead of having to depend on the speed of the
aeroplane for this why not depend on the speed of the propellerin
other words the whizzer

Well we do said Tom a bit puzzled as to what his friend was trying
to get at If the propeller didnt move the airship wouldnt
risethat is unless its of the balloon type

What I mean said Mr Damon is to have an aeroplane that will move
in the air the same as a boat moves in the water You dont have to get
the propeller of a boat racing around at the rate of a million
revolutions a minute more or less before your boat will travel do
you If the engine turns the screw or propeller just over say fifty
times a minute you would get some motion of the boat wouldnt you

Why yes some admitted Tom

And what causes it asked Mr Damon anticipating a triumph

The resistance of the water to the blades of the screw or propeller
answered Tom

Exactly And its the resistance of the air to the blades of an
airship propeller that sends the craft along isnt it

Yes And because of the difference in density between air and water it
becomes necessary to revolve an aeroplane propeller many times faster
than a boat propeller Its the density that makes the difference Mr
Damon If air were as dense as water we could have comparatively
slowmoving motors and propellers and

Ha There you have it Tom And there is where my WhizzerWakefield
Damons Whizzeris going to revolutionize air travel cried the
eccentric man The difference in density If air were as dense as
water the problem would be solved And I have solved it Im going to
turn the trick Tom One more question How can air be made as dense as
water Tom Swift

Why by condensation or compression I suppose was the rather slow
answer You know they have condensed or compressed air until it is
liquid Ive done it myself as an experiment

Thats it Tom Thats it cried Mr Damon in delight Compressed
air will do the trick Not compressed to a liquid exactly but almost
so Im going to revolve the propellers of my new airship in compressed
air so dense that they will not have to have a speed of more than
seven hundred revolutions a minute Whats that compared to the three
to ten thousand revolutions of the propellers now used The propellers
of Damons Whizzer will be of the pusher type and will revolve in
dense compressed air almost like water and that will do away with
high speed motors with all their complications and make traveling in
the clouds as simple as taking out a little onecylinder motor boat
Hows that Tom Swift Hows that for an idea

To Mr Damons disappointment Tom was not enthusiastic The young
inventor gazed at his eccentric friend and then said slowly

Well thats all right in theory but how is it going to work out in
practice

Thats what I came to see you about Tom was the reply Bless my
tall hat but thats just why I hurried over here I wanted to tell you
when I saw you going off on a trip with Miss Nestor Thats my big
ideaDamons Whizzerpropellers revolving in compressed air like
water Isnt that great

Im sorry to shatter your air castle said Tom but for the life of
me I cant see how it will work Of course in theory if you could
revolve a bigbladed propeller in very dense or in liquid air there
would be more resistance than in the rarefied atmosphere of the upper
regions And if this could be done I grant you that you could use
slower motors and smaller propeller bladesmore like those of a motor
boat But how are you going to get the condensed air

Make it said Mr Damon promptly Air pumps are cheap Just carry
one or two on board the aeroplane and condense the air as you go
along Thats a small detail that can easily be worked out I leave
that to you

Id rather you wouldnt said Tom Thats the whole
difficultycompressing your air Wait Ill explain it to you

Then the young inventor went into details He told of the ponderous
machinery needed to condense air to a form approximating water and
spoke of the terrible pressure exerted by the liquid atmosphere

Anything that you would gain by having a slowspeed motor and smaller
propeller blades would be lost by the ponderous aircondensing
machinery you would need Tom told Mr Damon Besides if you could
surround your propellers with a strata of condensed air it would
create such terrible cold as to freeze the propeller blades and make
them as brittle as glass

Why I have taken a heavy piece of metal dipped it into liquid air
and I could shatter the steel with a hammer as easily as a sheet of
ice The cold of liquid air is beyond belief

Attempts have been made to make motors run with liquid air but they
have not succeeded To condense air and to carry it about so that
propellers might revolve in it would be out of the question

You think so Tom asked Mr Damon

Im sure of it

Oh dear Thats too bad Bless my overshoes but I thought I had a
new idea Well you ought to know So Damons Whizzer goes on the scrap
heap before ever its built Well well say no more about it You
ought to know best Tom I wasnt thinking of it so much for myself as
for you I thought youd like some new idea to work on

Much obliged Mr Damon but I have a new idea said Tom

You have What is it Tell methat is if it isnt a secret went on
the eccentric man as much delighted over Toms new plan as he had been
over his own Whizzer doomed to failure so soon

It isnt a secret from you said Tom I got the idea while I was
riding with Mary I wanted to talk to herto tell her not to jump out
when we had a little accidentbut I had trouble making myself
understood because of the noise of the motor

They do make a great racket conceded Mr Damon But I dont suppose
anything can be done about it

I dont see why there cant exclaimed Tom And thats my new
ideato make a silent aircraft motorperhaps silent propeller blades
though its the motor that makes the most noise And thats what Im
going to doinvent a silent aeroplane Not because I want so much to
talk when I take passengers up in the air but I believe such a motor
would be valuable especially for scouting planes in war work To go
over the enemys lines and not be heard would be valuable many times

And thats what Im going to dowork on a silent motor for Uncle Sam
Ive got the germ of an idea and now

Excuse me said a voice behind Mr Damon and Tom and turning the
young inventor beheld the form of Mr Peton Gale president of the
Universal Flying Machine Company




CHAPTER VI

MAKING PLANS


Tom Swift had drawn pencil and paper from his pocket and as he and
Mr Damon were sitting on the steps of one of the shops the young
inventor was about to demonstrate by a drawing part of his new project
when the interruption came in the shape of one of the men who had an
hour before made a business offer to Tom

Excuse me went on Mr Peton Gale but Mr Ware and I got to talking
it over on our way to the stationthe matter of having you in our
company Mr Swiftand we concluded that it was worth twentyfive
thousand dollars a year for us to have you So I came back

It isnt of the slightest use Mr Gale I assure you said Tom a
bit heatedly for he did not like the persistency of this man nor did
he like his coming on the factory grounds unannounced and in this
secret manner I told you I could not accept your offer It is not
altogether a matter of money My word was final

Oh very well if you put it that way said Mr Gale stiffly of
course there is nothing more to say But I thought perhaps you did not
consider we had offered you enough and

Your offer is fair enough from a financial standpoint said Tom but
I simply cannot accept it I have other plans Jackson he called to
one of his mechanics who was passing kindly see Mr Gale to the gate
and then let me know how it was any one came in here without a permit

Yes sir said the mechanic as he stood significantly waiting

There was no one at the gate when I came in said Mr Gale and his
manner was antagonizing I wanted to speak to youto ask you to
reconsider your offerso I came back

It is against the rules to admit strangers to the shop grounds said
Tom Goodday

The president of the Universal Flying Machine Company did not respond
but there was a look on his face as he turned away that had Tom seen
it might have caused him some uneasiness But he did not see Instead
he resumed his talk with Mr Damon

Tom your idea is most interesting declared the eccentric man I
hope you will be able to work it out

Im going to try said the young inventor I hope that manMr
Galedidnt hear anything of what I was saying He sneaked up on us
before I was aware any one was near but ourselves

I dont imagine he heard very much Tom said Mr Damon He may have
heard you mention a silent motor

Thats just what I wish he hadnt heard broke in Tom Thats the
germ of the idea and once it becomes known that I am working on that
Well theres no use crying over spilled milk and he smiled at the
homely proverb Ill have to work in secret once Ive started

Do you think the government would use it Tom asked his friend

I should think it would be glad to Consider what a wonderful part
airships are playing in the present war It really is a struggle to see
which will be the master of the skythe Allies or the Germansand up
to recently the Huns had the advantage Then the Allies recognizing
how vital it was began to forge ahead and now Uncle Sam with his
troops under General Pershing is leading everything or will lead
shortly We have been a bit slow with our aircraft production but now
we are booming along Uncle Sam will soon have the mastery of the sky

I hope so sighed Mr Damon We must beat the Germans

Briefly Tom spoke of what Pershings men were doing with their
aeroplanes in France and mention was made of what the French and
British had done prior to the entrance of the United States into the
World War

While we were yet neutral Americans had made gallant names for
themselves flying for France and with my silent motor they ought to do
better declared Tom

Is silence its chief recommendation asked Mr Damon

Yes replied Tom Or rather it will be when I have it perfected
Aeroplane motors now are about as compact and speedy as they can be
made It is only the terrific noise that is a handicap It is a
handicap to the pilots and observers in the craft as they cannot
communicate except through a special speaking tube and this is not
always satisfactory or sure Then too the noise of an airship
proclaims its approach to the enemy sometimes long before it can be
seen

With a silent motor all this would be done away with With my new
craft in case I can perfect it the enemys lines can be approached as
silently as the Indians used to approach the log cabins of the white
settlers That will be its great advantagenot that conversation can
be more easily carried on for that is after all an unimportant
detail But to approach the enemys lines in the silence of the night
would be a distinct gain

I believe it would Tom exclaimed Mr Damon And I should think
too that Uncle Sam would be glad to get such a motor he added

Well hell have one to take if he wants it if I can make my plans a
success declared Tom That is unless those other fellows get ahead
of me

What other fellows asked Mr Damon

Gale Ware and their crowd was the answer I fancy they are
provoked because I wouldnt agree to work for them and now that Gale
overheardas he must havewhat I propose working on they may try
that game themselves

You mean try to turn out a silent motor

Yes It would be a big feather in their cap for their company so far
hasnt been very successful on government orders Thats why they came
to me I guess

I shouldnt be surprised Tom conceded Mr Damon Since the
government accepted your giant cannon and your great searchlight you
have come into greater prominence than ever before And those two
things are a wonderful success

Yes admitted Tom modestly enough the big electric light seems to
have been of some benefit on the European battle front and though they
havent been able to make and transport as many of my giant cannons as
Id like to see over there it is progressing I understand

And this is true For the details of these two inventions of Tom
Swifts I refer my readers to the books bearing those titles
Sufficient to state here that the government was using these two
inventions and there had been no necessity for commandeering them
either since Tom had freely offered them at the declaration of war
with Germany

Well since I cant help you with my Whizzer said Mr Damon with
a smile let me do what I can toward your silent motor Tom What are
you going to call it

Oh I dont knowhadnt thought of a name I guess Air Scout would
be as good as any Thats what it will bea machine for silently
scouting in the air And now to get down to brass tacks as the poet
says I believe I will

Gentleman to see you Mr Swift interrupted Jackson

Bless my penwiper cried Mr Damon More visitors I hope it isnt
Gale or Ware come back to see what they can spy on




CHAPTER VII

A PROBLEM IN SOUND


Tom Swift looked up with a distinct appearance of being annoyed that
was unusual with him for he was nearly always goodnatured But the
frown that had replaced the pleasant look on his face while he was
talking to Mr Damon about the projected new air scout was at once
wiped away as he looked at the card Jackson held out to him

Bring him in right away he ordered He neednt have stood on that
ceremony

Well he said it was a business call returned the mechanician with a
cheerful grin and he said he wanted it done according to form So he
gave me his card to bring you

Who is it asked Mr Damon with the privilege of an old friend

Its Ned Newton Tom answered though why hes putting on all this
formality I cant fathom

Jackson went back to the main gate and told the man on guard there to
admit Ned who had so formally sent in his card

Ah Mr Swift I believe began the bank employee with that suave
formal air which usually precedes a business meeting

That is my name said Tom with a suppressed grin and he spoke as
stiffly as though to a perfect stranger

Mr Tom Swift the great inventor went on Ned

Yes

Ah then I am at the right place Just sign here please on the
dotted line and he held out a blank form and a fountain pen to Tom
who took them half mechanically

Huh Whats the big idea Ned asked the young inventor unable
longer to carry on the joke Is this a warrant for my arrest or
merely a testimonial to you If its the latter and concerns your
nerve Ill gladly sign it

Well its something like that laughed Ned Thats your application
for another block of Liberty Bonds Tom and I want you as a personal
favor to me as a business favor to the bank and as your plain duty to
Uncle Sam to double your last subscription

Tom looked at the sum Ned had filled in on the blank form and uttered
a slight whistle of surprise

Thats all right now said Ned with the air of a professional
salesman You can stand that and more too Im letting you off easy
Why I got Marys fatherMr Nestorfor twice what he took last time
and Mary herselfhard as shes working for the Red Crossgave me a
nice application So its up to you to

Nuff said exclaimed Tom sententiously as he signed his name I
may have to reconsider my recent refusal of the offer of the Universal
Flying Machine Company though if I havent money enough to meet this
subscription Ned

Oh youll meet it all right Much obliged and Ned folded the
Liberty Bond subscription paper and put it in his pocket But did you
turn down the offer from those people

I did answered Tom But how did you know about it Ned

First let me say that Im glad you decided to have nothing to do with
them Theyre a rich firm and have lots of money but I wouldnt trust
em even if they have some government contracts The way I happened
to know they were likely to make you an offer is this continued Ned
Newton

They do business with one of the New York banks with which my
banknotice the accent on the my Tomis connected The other day I
happened to see some correspondence about you These flying machine
people asked our bank to find out certain things about you and as a
matter of business we had to give the information Sort of a
commercial agency report you know nothing unusual and it isnt the
first time its been done since your business got so large But thats
how I happened to know these fellows contemplated dickering with you

Do you know Gale or Ware Tom asked

Not personally But in a business way Tom Id warn you to look out
for them as theyre sharp dealers They put one over on the government
all right and there may be some unpleasant publicity to it later But
theyre putting up a big bluff and pretending they can turn out a lot
of flying machines for use in Europe Why dont you get busy on that
end of the game Tom

I know youve more than done your bit with Liberty Bonds
subscriptions to the Y M C A and other war work besides your war
tank and other inventions But youre such a shark on flying machines I
should think youd offer your factory to the government for the
production of aeroplanes

I would in a minute Ned and you know it but the fact of the matter
is my shops arent equipped for the production of anything in large
numbers We do mostly an experimenting business here making only one
or two of a certain machine I have told the government officials they
can have anything Ive got and you know they wouldnt let me enlist
when I was working on the war tank

Yes I remember that said Ned Youre no slacker I wanted to
shoulder a rifle too but they keep me at this Liberty Loan work
Well Uncle Sam ought to know

Thats what I say agreed Tom and thats why I havent gone to the
front myself And now as it happens Ive got something else in mind
that may help Uncle Sam

What is it

A silent flying machine for scout work on the battle front Tom told
his friend and then he gave a few details such as those he had been
telling Mr Damon

Then I dont wonder you turned down the offer of the Universal
people remarked Ned at the conclusion of the recital This will be
a heap more help to the government Tom than working for those people
even at twentyfive thousand dollars a year And if you get short and
cant meet your newest Liberty Bond payments why I guess the bank
will stretch your credit a little

Thanks laughed Tom but Ill try not to ask them

The friends talked together a little longer and then Ned had to take
his departure to solicit more subscriptions while Mr Damon went with
him the eccentric man saying he would go home to Waterfield

But bless my overshoes Tom he exclaimed as he departed dont
forget to let me know when you have your silent motor working I want
to see it

Ill let you know was the promise given by the young inventor

And watch out for those Universal people warned Ned Im not
telling you this as a bank official for Im not supposed to but its
personal

Ill be on the watch said Tom And as he went into his private
workshop he wondered why it was his father and Ned had both warned him
not to trust Gale and Ware

The next few days were busy ones for Tom Swift Once he had made up his
mind to go to work seriously on a silent motor all else was put aside
He sent a note to Mary Nestor telling her what he was going to do
and asking her to say nothing about it which of course Mary agreed
to

Come and see me when you can she sent back word but I know you
wont have much chance when youre experimenting with your invention
And I shall be working so hard for the Red Cross that I shant get
much chance to entertain you But the war cant last forever

No agreed Tom with a sigh as he put away her letter and thank
goodness that it cant

The young inventor threw himself into the perplexing work of inventing
a silent motor with all the fervor he had given to the production of
his war tank his giant cannon his wonderful searchlight and other
machines

And mused Tom as he sat at his work table with pencil and paper
before him since this is a problem in acoustics I had best begin I
suppose by going back to first principles and after determining what
makes an aeroplane engine noisy try to figure out how to make it
quiet Now as to the first the principle causes of noise are

And at that instant there broke on Toms ears a succession of
discordant sounds which seemed to be a combination of an Indians war
whoop and a college students yells at a football game

Now I wonder what that is mused the young inventor as he hastily
arose Better solve that problem before I tackle the aeroplane motor




CHAPTER VIII

THROUGH THE ROOF



Tom rushed from his private office and when he reached the outer door
he heard with more distinctness the sounds that had alarmed him They
seemed to come from a small building given over to electrical
apparatus and which at the time was not supposed to be in use It
had been Toms workroom so to speak when he was developing his
electric runabout and rifle but of late he had not spent much time in
it

Somebodys in there reflected the young inventor as he heard yells
coming from the open door of the place And if it isnt Koku and
Eradicate I miss my guess Wonder what they can be doing there

He crossed the yard between his private office and the electrical shop
in a few rapid strides and as he entered the latter place he was
greeted with a series of wild yells

Good volume of sound here at all events mused Tom Almost as much
as my motor made when I was trying to talk to Mary Hello there Whats
going on Is any one hurt Whats the matter he cried for at first
he could see no one in the dim light of the place The interior was a
maze of electrical apparatus

Whos here demanded Tom as he advanced

Oh Master Come quick Koku most dead an no can let go was the
cry

Yo jest bet yo caint let go chimed in the voice of Eradicate I
done knowed yo would git into trouble ef yo come heah an Ise glad
ob it So I is

What is it Rad What has happened to Koku cried Tom running
forward for though no very powerful current could be turned on in the
electrical shop at this period of unuse there was enough to be very
painful What is it Rad

Oh dat big foolish giant Koku done got his sef into trouble
chuckled the colored man He done got holt ob one ob dem air
contraptions Massa Tom an he caint let go Ha Ha Golly Look at
him squirm and Rad laughed shrilly which accounted for some of the
sounds Tom had heard

Then came yells of rage and pain from the giant and they were so loud
and vigorous mingling with Eradicates as they did that it was no
wonder Tom was startled The sounds were heard in the other shops and
men came running out But before then Tom had put an end to the trouble

One look showed him what had happened Just how or why Koku and
Eradicate had entered the electrical shop Tom did not then stop to
inquire But he saw that the giant had grasped the handles of one of
the electric machines designed for charging Leyden jars used in Toms
experiments and the powerful though not dangerous current had so
paralyzed temporarily the muscles of the giants hands and arms that
he could not let go and there he was squirming and not knowing how
to turn off the current and unable to ease himself while Eradicate
stood and laughed at him fairly howling with delight

Ha Guess yo wont do no mo spadin in Massa Toms garden right
away big man taunted Eradicate

Be quiet Rad ordered Tom as he reached up and pulled out the
switch thus shutting off the current This isnt anything to laugh
at

But he done look so funny Massa Tom pleaded the colored man He
done squirm laik

But Eradicate did not finish what he intended to say Once free from
the powerful current the giant looked at his numb hands and then
seeming to think that Eradicate was the cause of it all he sprang at
the colored man with a yell But Eradicate did not stay to see what
would happen With a howl of terror he raced out of the door and old
and rheumatic as he was he managed to gain the stable of his mule
Boomerang over which he had his humble but comfortable quarters

Well I guess hes safe for a while laughed Tom as he saw the giant
turn away shaking his fist at the closed door for Koku big as he
was stood in mortal terror of the mules heels

Tom locked the door of the electrical shop and went back to his
interrupted problem From Jackson he learned that Koku and Eradicate
had merely happened to stroll into the forbidden place which had been
left open by accident There it appeared Koku had handled some of the
machinery ending by switching on the current of the machine the
handles of which he later unsuspectingly picked up Then he received a
shock he long remembered and for many days he believed Eradicate had
been responsible for it and there was more than the usual hostile
feeling between the two But Eradicate was innocent of that trick at
all events

Though said Tom telling his father about it later Rad would have
turned on the current if he had known he could make trouble for Koku by
it I never saw their like for having disagreements

Yes but they are both devoted to you Tom said the aged inventor
But what is this you hinted ata silent motor you called it I
believe Are you really serious in trying to invent one

Yes Dad I am I think theres a big field for an aeroplane that
could travel along over the enemys linesparticularly at nightand
not be heard from below Think of the scout work that could be done

Well yes it could be done if you could get a silent motor or
propellers that made no noise Tom But I dont believe it can be done

Well maybe not Dad But Im going to try and Tom after a further
talk with his father began work in earnest on the big problem That it
was a big one Tom was not disposed to deny and that it would be a
valuable invention even his somewhat skeptical father admitted

How are you going to start Tom asked Mr Swift several days after
the big idea had come to the young man

Im going to experiment a bit at first Ive got a lot of old motors
that werent speedy enough for any of my flying machines and Im going
to make them over If I spoil them the loss wont amount to anything
and if I succeedwell maybe I can help out Uncle Sam a bit more

As Tom had said he would do he began at the very foundation and
studied the fundamental principles of sound

Sound the young inventor told Ned Newton in speaking about the
problem is a sensation which is peculiar to the ear though the
vibrations caused by sound waves may be felt in many parts of the body
But the ear is the great receiver of sound

You arent going to invent a sort of muffler for the ears are you
Tom asked Ned That would be an easy way of solving the problem but
I doubt if you could get the Germans to wear your eartabs so they
wouldnt hear the sound of the Allied aeroplanes

No Im not figuring on doing the trick that way said Tom with a
laugh Ive really got to cut down the sound of the motor and the
propeller blades so a person listening with all his ears wont hear
any noise unless hes within a few feet of the plane

Well I can tell you right off the reel how to do it said the bank
employee

How asked Tom eagerly

Run your engine and propellers in a vacuum was the prompt reply

Hum said Tom musingly Yes that would be a simple way out and
Ill do it if youll tell me how to breathe in a vacuum

Oh I didnt agree to do that laughed Ned

But he had spoken the truth as those who have studied physics well
know There must be an atmosphere for the transmission of sound which
is the reason all is cold and silent and still at the moon There is no
atmosphere there Sound implies vibration Something such as liquid
gas or solid must be set in motion to produce sound and for the
purpose of science the air we breathe may be considered a gas being
composed of two

Not only must the object either solid liquid or gaseous be in
motion to produce sound but the air surrounding the vibrating body
must also be moving in unison with it And lastly there must be some
medium of receiving the sound wavesthe ear or some part of the body
Totally deaf persons may be made aware of sound through the vibrations
received through their hands or feet They receive of course only the
more intense or largest sound waves and can not hear notes of music
nor spoken words though they may feel the vibration when a piano is
played And as Ned has said no sound is produced in a vacuum

But said Tom since I cant run my aeroplane in a vacuum or even
have the propellers revolve in one its up to me to solve the problem
some other way The propellers dont really make noise enough to worry
about when theyre high in the air Its the exhaust from the motor
and to get rid of that will be my first attempt

Can it be done asked Ned

I dont know was Toms frank answer

They do it on an automobile to a great extent went on Ned Some of
em you cant hardly hear

Yes but an aeroplane engine runs many many times faster than the
motor of an auto said Tom and there are more explosions to muffle
I doubt if the muffler of an auto would cut down the sound of an aero
engine to any appreciable extent But of course Ill try along those
lines

They have mufflers or silencers for guns and rifles went on Ned
Couldnt you make a big one of those contraptions and put it on an
aeroplane

I doubt it said Tom shaking his head Of course its the same
principle as that in an auto muffler or on a motor boata series of
baffle plates arranged within a hollow cylinder But all such devices
cut down power and I dont want to do that However Im going to
solve the problem orbust

And Tom came near busting Ned remarked later when he and his friend
talked over the progress of the invention

Two weeks had passed since the start of his evolution of his new idea
and following the visiting of the representatives of the Universal
Flying Machine Company Since then neither Gale nor Ware had
communicated with Tom

But I must be on the watch against them thought the young inventor
Im pretty sure Gale heard me mention what I was going to try to
invent and he may get ahead of me and put a silent motor on the
market first Not that Im afraid of being done out of any profits but
I simply dont want to be beaten

The details of Toms invention cannot be gone into but roughly it
was based on the principle of not only a muffler but also of producing
less noise when the charges of gasoline exploded in the cylinders It
is of course the explosion of gasoline mixed with air that causes an
internal combustion engine to operate And it is the expulsion of the
burned gases that causes the exhaust and makes the noise that is heard

Tom was working along the wellknown line of the rate of travel of
sound which progresses at the rate of about 1090 feet a second when
air is at the freezing point And roughly with every degree increase
in the atmospheres temperature the velocity of sound increases by one
foot Thus at a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 68 degrees
above freezing there would be added to the 1090 feet the 68 feet
making sound travel at 100 degrees Fahrenheit about 1158 feet a second

Tom had set up in his shop a powerful but not very speedy old
aeroplane engine and had attached to it the device he hoped would help
him toward solving his problem of cutting down the noise He had had
some success with it and after days and nights of labor he invited
his father and Ned as well as Mr Damon over to see what he hoped
would be a final experiment

His visitors had assembled in the shop and Eradicate was setting out
some refreshments which Tom had provided the colored man being in his
element now

Whats all this figuring Tom asked Mr Damon as he saw a series of
calculations on some sheets of paper lying on Toms desk

Thats where I worked out how much faster sound traveled in hydrogen
gas than in the ordinary atmosphere was the answer It goes about
four times as fast or nearly four thousand two hundred feet a second
You remember the rule I suppose The speed of sonorous vibrations
through gases varies inversely as the squares of the weights of equal
volumes of the gases or in other words

Give it to us chiefly in other words if you please Tom pleaded
Ned with a laugh Let that go and do some tricks Start the engine
and lets see if we can hear it

Oh you can hear it all right said Tom as he approached the motor
which was mounted on a testing block The thing isnt perfected yet
but I hope to have it soon Rad Where is that black rascal Oh there
you are Come here Rad

Yaas sah Massa Tom Is I gwine to help yo all in dish yeah job

Yes Just take hold of this lever and when I say so pull it as hard
as you can

Dats whut I will Massa Tom Golly ef dat no count giant was heah
now hed see he aint de only one whuts got muscle Ill pull good
an hard Massa Tom

Yes thats what I want you to Now I guess were all ready Can you
see Dadand Ned and Mr Damon

Yes they answered They stood near the side wall of the shop while
Tom and Eradicate were at the testing block on which the motor with
the noiseeliminating devices attached had been temporarily mounted

All ready called the young inventor as he turned on the gas and
threw over the electrical switch All ready Pull the starting lever
Rad and when its been running a little Ill throw on the silencer and
you can see the difference

The motor began to hum and there was a deafening roar just as there
always is when the engine of an aeroplane starts It was as though half
a dozen automobile engines were being run with the mufflers cut out

Now Ill show you the difference yelled Tom though such was the
noise that not a word could be heard This shows you what my silencer
will do

Tom pulled another lever There was at once a cessation of the
deafening racket though it was not altogether ended Then after a
moment or two there suddenly came a roar as though a blast had been
let off in the shop

Tom and Eradicate were tossed backward head over heels as though by
the giant hands of Koku himself and Mr Damon Ned and Toms father
saw the motor fly from the testing block and shoot through the roof of
the building with a rending crashing and splintering sound that could
be heard for a mile




CHAPTER IX

AFTER A SPY


Curious as it may seem Eradicate the oldest and certainly not the
most energetic of the party assembled in the experiment room was the
first to recover himself and arise Tottering to his feet he gave one
look at the testing block whence the motor had torn itself Then he
looked at the prostrate figures around him none of them hurt but all
stunned and very much startled Then the gaze of Eradicate traveled to
the hole in the roof It was a gaping ragged hole for the motor was
heavy and the roof of flimsy material And then the colored man
exclaimed

Good land ob massy Did I do dat

His tone was one of such startled contrition and so tragic that Tom
Swift rueful as he felt over the failure of his experiment and the
danger they had all been in could not help laughing

I take it hearing that from you Tom that were all right said Ned
Newton as he recovered himself and brushed some dirt off his coat Ned
was a natty dresser

Yes we seem to be all right replied Tom slowly I cant say what
damage the flying motor has done outside but

Bless my insurance policy but what happened asked Mr Damon I saw
Eradicate pull on that lever as you told him to Tom and then things
all went topsyturvy Did he pull the wrong handle

No it wasnt Rads fault at all said Tom The trouble was as I
guess Ill find when I investigate that I put too much power into the
motor and the muffler didnt give any chance for the accumulated
exhaust gases to expand and escape I didnt allow for that and they
simply backed up compressed and exploded I guess thats the whole
explanation

Im inclined to agree with you Son said Mr Swift dryly Dont
try to get rid of all the noise at once Eliminate it by degrees and it
will be safer

I guess so agreed Tom

By this time a score of workmen from the other shops had congregated
around the one though the roof of which the motor had been blown Tom
opened the door to assure Jackson and the others that no one was hurt
and then the young inventor saw the exploded motor had buried in the
dirt a short distance away from the experiment building

Lucky none of us were standing over it when it went up said Tom as
he made an inspection of the broken machine Wed have gone through
the roof with it

She certainly went sailing commented Ned Must have been a lot of
power there Tom

And this was evidenced by the bent and twisted rods that had held the
motor to the testing block and by the cylinders some of which were
torn apart as though made of paper instead of heavy steel But for the
fact that all the force of the explosion was directly upward instead
of at the sides none might have been left alive in the shop All had
escaped most fortunately and they realized this

Well queried Ned as Tom gave orders to have the damaged machine
removed and the roof repaired does this end the wonderful silent
motor Tom

End it What do you mean

I mean are you going to experiment any further

Why of course Just because Ive had one failure doesnt mean that
Im going to give up Especially when I know what the matter wasnot
leaving any vent for the escaping gases Why this isnt anything When
I was perfecting my giant cannon I was nearly blown up more than once
and you remember how we got stuck in the submarine

I should say I did exclaimed Ned with a shudder I dont want any
more of that But as between being blown through a roof and held at the
bottom of the sea I dont know that theres much choice

Well perhaps not agreed Tom But as for ending my experiments I
wouldnt dream of such a thing Why Ive only just begun Ill have a
silent motor yet

And a nonexplosive one I hope added Mr Damon dryly Bless my
shoe buttons Tom but if my wife knew what danger Id been in shed
never let me come over to see you any more

Well the next time I invite you to a test Ill be more careful
promised the young inventor

There isnt going to be any next time as far as Im concerned
laughed Ned I think its safer to sell Liberty Bonds

And though they joked about it they all realized the narrow escape
they had had As for Eradicate once he knew he had not been the one
who caused the damage he felt rather proud of the part he had taken in
the mishap and for many days he boasted about it to Koku

True to his determination Tom Swift did not give up his experimental
work on the silent motor The machine that had been blown through the
roof was useless now and it was sent to the scrap heap after as much
of it as possible had been salvaged Then Tom got another piece of
apparatus out of his store room and began all over again

He worked along the same lines as at firstproviding a chamber for the
escaping gases of the exhaust to expend their noise and energy in at
the same time laboring to cut down the concussion of the explosions in
the cylinder without reducing their force any And that it was no easy
problem to do either of these Tom had to admit as he progressed All
previous types of mufflers or silencers had to be discarded and a new
one evolved

Jackson I need some one to help me said Tom to his chief
mechanician one day Havent you a good man who is used to
experimental work that you can let me take from the works

Why yes was the answer Let me see Roberts is busy on the new
bomb you got up but I could take him off that

No dont interposed Tom I want that work to go on Isnt there
some one else you can let me have

Well theres a new man who came to me well recommended I took him on
last week and hes a wonderful mechanic Knows a lot about gas
engines I could let you have himBower his name is The only thing
about it though is that I dont like to give you a man of whom I am
not dead certain when youre working on a new device

Oh that will be all right said Tom There wont be any secrets he
can get if you mean you think he might be up to spy work

Thats what I did mean Tom You never can tell you know and you
have some bitter enemies

Yes but Ill take care this man doesnt see the plans or any of my
drawings I only want some one to do the heavy assembling work on the
experimental muffler Im getting up We can let him think its for a
new kind of automobile

Oh then I guess it will be all right Ill send Bower to you

Tom rather liked the new workman who seemed quiet and efficient He
did not ask questions either about the machine on which he was
engaged but did as he was told As Tom had said he kept his plans and
drawing under lock and keyin a safe to be exactand he did not think
they were in any danger from his new helper

But Tom Swift held into altogether too slight regard the powers of
those who were opposed to him He did not appreciate the depths to
which they would stoop to gain their ends

He had been working hard on his new device and had reached a point
further along than when the other motor had exploded He began to see
success ahead of him and he was jubilant Whether this made him
careless does not matter but the fact was that he left Bower more to
himself and alone in the experimental shop several times

And it was on one of these occasions when Tom had been for some time
in one of the other shops where he and Jackson were in consultation
over a new machine that as he came back to the test room unexpectedly
he saw Bower move hastily away from in front of the safe Moreover Tom
was almost certain he had heard the steel door clang shut as he
approached the building

And then before he could ask his helper a question Tom looked from a
window and saw a stranger running hastily along the side of the
building where his trial motor was being set up

Whos that Who is that man Did he come in here Was he tampering
with my safe cried Tom He saw Bower hesitate and change color and
Tom knew it was time to act

The window was open and with one bound the young inventor was out and
running after the stranger he had seen departing in such a hurry The
man was but a short distance ahead of him and Tom saw he was stuffing
some papers into his pocket

Here Come back Stop ordered Tom but the man ran on the faster

Thats a spy as sure as guns reflected Tom Swift And Bower is in
with him he added Ive got to catch that fellow and he speeded
his pace as he ran after the fellow




CHAPTER X

A BIG SPLASH


There was no question in the mind of Tom Swift but that the man he was
running after was guilty of some wrongdoing In the first place he was
a stranger and had no right inside the big fence that surrounded the
Swift machine plant Then too the very fact that he ran away was
suspicious

And this coupled with the confusion on the part of Bower and his
proximity to the safe made Tom fear that some of his plans had been
stolen These he was very anxious to recover if this strange man had
them and so he raced after him with all speed

Stop Stop called Tom but the onracing stranger did not heed

The cries of the young inventor soon attracted the attention of his
men and Jackson and some of the others came running from their various
shops to give whatever aid was needed But they were all too far away
to give effective chase

Bower might have come with me if he had wanted to help thought Tom
But a backward glance over his shoulder did not show that the new
helper was engaging in the pursuit and he could have started almost on
the same terms as Tom himself

The runaway looking back to see how near the young inventor was to
him suddenly changed his course and noting this Tom Swift thought

Ive got him now Hell be bogged if he runs that way for the way
led to a piece of swampy land that after the recent rains was a
veritable bog which was dangerous for cattle at least and more than
one man had been caught there

He cant run across the swamp thats sure reflected Tom with some
satisfaction Ill get him all right

But he wanted to capture the man if possible before he reached the
bog and to this end Tom increased his speed to such good end that
presently on the firm ground that bordered the swamp Tom was almost
within reaching distance of the stranger

But the latter kept up running and dodged and turned so that Tom could
not lay hands on him Suddenly turning around a clump of trees the
fleeing man headed straight for a veritable mud hole that lay directly
in his path It was part of the swampthe most liquid part of the bog
and a home of frogs and lizards

Too late the man who was evidently unaware of the proximity of the
swamp saw his danger His further flight was cut off by the mud hole
but it was too late to turn back Tom Swift was at his heels now and
seeing that it was impossible to grab the man Tom did the next best
thing He stuck out his foot and tripped him and tripped him right on
the edge of the mud hole so that the man fell in with a big splash
the muddy water flying all around some even over the young inventor

For a moment the man disappeared completely beneath the surface for
the mud hole was rather deep just where Tom had thrown him Then there
was another violent agitation of the surface and a very woebegone and
muddy face was raised from the slough followed by the rest of the
figure of the man Slowly he got to his feet mud and water dripping
from him He cleared his face by rubbing his hands over it not that it
made his countenance clean but it removed masses of mud from his eyes
nose and mouth so that he could see and speak though his first
operation was to gasp for breath

Whatwhat are you doin he demanded of Tom and as the man opened
his mouth to speak Tom was aware of a glitter which disclosed the
fact that the man had a large front tooth of gold

What am I doing repeated Tom I think its up to you to answer that
question not me What are you doing

Youyou tripped me into this mud hole declared the man

I did yes because you were trespassing on my property and ran away
instead of stopping when I told you to went on Tom Who are you and
what are you doing What were you doing with Bower at my shop

Nothin I wasnt doin nothin

Well well inquire into that I want to see what you have in your
pockets before I believe you Come on out

You havent any right to go through my pockets blustered the
stranger

Oh havent I Well Im going to take the right JacksonKokujust
see that he doesnt get away Well take him back and search him and
Tom motioned to his chief machinist and the giant who had reached the
scene to take charge of the man But Koku was sufficient for this
purpose and the mudbespattered stranger seemed to shrink as he saw
the big creature approach him There was no question of running away
after that

Bring him along ordered Tom and Koku taking a tight grip on the
man by the slack of his garments behind walked him along toward the
office the mud and water splashing and oozing from his shoes at every
step

Now you look here the goldtoothed man cried as he was forced
along you aint got any right to detain me I aint done nothin
And each time he spoke the bright tooth in his mouth glittered in the
sun

I dont know whether youve done anything or not said Tom Im
going to take you back and see what you and Bower have to say He may
know something about this

If he does I dont believe hell tell said Jackson

Why not asked Tom quickly

Because hes gone

Gone Bower gone

Yes answered Jackson I saw him running out of the experiment shop
as we raced along to help you I didnt think at the time that he was
doing more than go for aid perhaps But I see the game now

Oh you meanhim and Tom pointed to the dripping figure

Yes said Jackson in a low voice as Koku went on ahead with his
prisoner If as you say this man was in league with Bower the
latter has smelled a rat and skipped He has run away and I only hope
he hasnt done any damage or got hold of any of your plans

Well soon know about that said Tom I wonder who is at the bottom
of this

Maybe those men you wouldnt work for suggested the machinist

You mean Gale and Ware of the Universal Flying Machine Company

Yes

Oh I dont believe theyd stoop to any such measures as thissending
spies around replied Tom But I cant be too careful Well
investigate

The first result of the investigation was to disclose the fact that
Bower was gone He had taken his few possessions and left the Swift
plant while Tom was racing after the stranger A hasty examination of
the safe did not reveal anything missing as Toms plans and papers
were intact But they showed evidences of having been looked over for
they were out of the regular order in which the young inventor kept
them

I begin to see it said Tom musingly Bower must have managed to
open the safe while I was gone and he must have made a hasty copy of
some of the drawings of the silent motor and passed them out of the
window to this goldtooth man who tried to make off with them Did you
find anything on him he asked as one of the men who had been
instructed to search the stranger came into the office just then

Not a thing Mr Swift Not a thing was the answer We took off
every bit of his clothes and wrapped him in a blanket Hes in the
engine room getting dry now But there isnt a thing in any of his
pockets

But I saw him stuffing some papers in as he ran away from me said
Tom We must be sure about this And dont let the fellow get away
until I question him

Oh hes safe enough answered the man Koku is guarding him He
wont get away

Then Ill have a look at his clothes decided Tom He may have a
secret pocket

But nothing like this was disclosed and the most careful search did
not reveal anything incriminating in the mans garments

He might have thrown away any papers Bower gave him said Tom Maybe
theyre at the bottom of the mud hole If theyre there theyre safe
enough But have a search made of the ground where this man ran

This was done but without result Some of the workmen even dragged the
mud hole without finding anything Then Tom and his father had a talk
with the stranger who refused to give his name The man was sullen and
angry He talked loudly about his innocence and of having the law on
Tom for having tripped him into the mud

All right if you want to make a complaint go ahead said the young
inventor Ill make one against you for trespass Why did you come on
my grounds

I was going to ask for work Im a good machinist and I wanted a job

How did you get in Who admitted you at the gate

II jest walked in said the man but Tom knew this could not be
true as no strangers were admitted without a permit and none had been
issued The man denied knowing anything about Bower but the latters
flight was evidence enough that something was wrong

Not wishing to go to the trouble of having the man arrested merely as a
trespasser Tom let him go after his clothes had been dried on a boiler
in one of the shops

Take him to the gate and tell him if he comes back hell get another
dose of the same kind of medicine ordered Tom to one of the guards at
the plant and when the latter had reported that this had been done he
added in an earnest tone

He went off talking to himself and saying hed get even with you Mr
Swift

All right said Tom easily Ill be on the watch

The young inventor made a thorough examination of his experiment shop
and the test motor No damage seemed to have been done and Tom began
to think he had been too quick for the conspirators if such they were
His plans and drawings were intact and though Bower might have given a
copy to the stranger with the gold tooth the latter did not take any
away with him That he had some papers he wished to conceal and escape
with seemed certain but the splash into the mud hole had ended this

No trace was found of Bower and an effort Tom made to ascertain if the
man was a spy in the employ of Gale and Ware came to naught The
machinist had come well recommended and the firm where he was last
employed had nothing but good to say of him

Well its a mystery decided Tom However I got out of it pretty
well Only if that goldtooth individual shows up again he wont get
off so easily




CHAPTER XI

A NIGHT TRIP


Taking a lesson from what had happened Tom was very much more careful
in the following experiments on his new silent motor He made some
changes in his shop and took Jackson in to help on the new machine
thus insuring perfect secrecy as the apparatus developed

Tom also changed the safe in which he kept his plans for the one he
had used previous to the episode in which Bower and the stranger who
took the mud bath figured was one the combination of which could
easily be ascertained by an expert The new safe was more complicated
and Tom felt that his plans specifications and formulae which he had
worked out were in less danger

I can just about figure out what happened said Ned Newton to Tom
when told of the circumstances These Universal people were provoked
because you wouldnt give them the benefit of your experience on their
flying machines and so they sent a spy to get work with you They
perhaps hoped to secure some of your ideas for their own or they may
have had a deeper motive

What deeper motive could they have Ned

They might have hoped to disable you or some of your machines so that
you couldnt compete with them Theyre unscrupulous I hear and will
do anything to succeed and make money So be on your guard against
them

I will Tom promised But I dont believe theres any more danger
now Anyhow I have to take some chances

Yes but be as careful as you can How is the silent motor coming on

Pretty good Ive had a lot of failures and the thing isnt so easy
as I at first imagined it would be Noise is a funny thing and Im
just beginning to understand some of the laws of acoustics we learned
at high school But I think Im on the right track with the muffler and
the cutting down of the noise of the explosions in the cylinders Im
working both ends you seemaking a motor that doesnt cause as much
racket as those now in use and also providing means to take care of
the noise that is made It isnt possible to make a completely silent
motor of an explosive gas type The only thing that can be done is to
kill the noise after it is made

What about the propeller blades

Oh they arent giving me any trouble The noise they make cant be
heard a hundred feet in the air but I am also working on improvements
to the blades Take it altogether Ill have an almost silent aeroplane
if my plans come out all right

Have you said anything to the government yet

No I want to have it pretty well perfected before I do Besides I
dont want any publicity about it until Im ready If these Universal
people are after me Ill fool em

Thats right Tom Well I must go Another week of this Liberty Bond
campaign

I suppose youll be glad when its over

Well I dont know said Ned slowly Its part of my small
contribution to Uncle Sam Im not like youI cant invent things

But you have an awful smooth line of talk Ned laughed his chum I
believe you could sell chloride of sodium to some of the fishes in the
Great Salt Lakethat is if it has fishes

I dont know that it has Tom And anyhow Im not posing as a salt
salesman and Ned grinned But I must really go Our bank hasnt
reached its quota in the sale of Liberty Bonds yet and its up to me
to see that it doesnt fall down

Go to it Ned And Ill get busy on my silent motor

Getting busy was Tom Swifts favorite occupation and when he was
working on a new idea as was the case now he was seldom idle night
or day

I have hardly seen you for two weeks Mary Nestor wrote him one day
Arent you ever coming to see me any more or take me for a ride

Yes Tom wrote back Ill be over soon And perhaps on the next ride
we take I wont have to shout at you through a speaking tube because
the motor makes so much noise

From this it may be gathered that Tom was on the verge of success
While not altogether satisfied with his progress the young inventor
felt that he was on the right track There were certain changes that
needed to be made in the apparatus he was buildingcertain refinements
that must be added and when this should be done Tom was pretty certain
that he would have what would prove to be a very quiet aeroplane if
not an absolutely silent one

The young inventor was engaged one day with some of the last details of
the experiment The new motor with the silencer and the changed
cylinders had been attached to one of Toms speedy aeroplanes and he
was making some intricate calculations in relation to a new cylinder
block to be used when he started to make a completely new machine of
the improved type

Tom had set down on paper some computations regarding the crosssection
of one of the cylinders and was working out the amount of stress to
which he could subject a shoulder strut when a shadow was cast across
the drawing board he had propped up in his lap

In an instant Tom pulled a blank sheet over his mass of figures and
looked up a sudden fear coming over him that another spy was at hand
But a hearty voice reassured him

Bless my rice pudding cried Mr Damon you shut yourself up here
Tom like a hermit in the mountains Why dont you come out and enjoy
life

Hello Glad to see you cried Tom joyfully Youre just in time

Time for whatdinner asked the eccentric man with a chuckle If
so my reference to rice pudding was very proper

Why yes I imagine there must be a dinner in prospect somewhere Mr
Damon said Tom with a smile Well have to see Mrs Baggert about
that But what I meant was that youre just in time to have a ride with
me if you want to go

Go where

Oh up in cloudland I have just finished my first sample of a silent
motor and Im going to try it this evening Would you like to come
along

I would exclaimed Mr Damon Bless my onion soup Tom but I would
But why fly at night Isnt it safer by daylight

Oh that doesnt make much difference Its safe enough at any time
The reason Im going to make my first flight after dark is that I dont
want any spies about

Oh I see Are they camping on your trail

Not exactly But I cant tell where they may be If I should start out
in daylight and be forced to make a landing Well you know what a
crowd always collects to see a stranded airship

Thats right Tom

That decided me to start off after dark Then if we have to come down
because of some sort of engine trouble or because my new attachment
doesnt work right we shant have any prying eyes

I see Well Tom Ill go with you Fortunately I didnt tell my wife
where I was going when I started out this afternoon so she wont worry
until after its over and then it wont hurt her Im ready any time
you are

Good Stay to dinner and Ill show you what Ive made Then well take
a flight after dark

This suited the eccentric man and a little later after he had eaten
one of Mrs Baggerts best meals including rice pudding of which he
was very fond Mr Damon accompanied Tom to one of the big hangars
where the new aeroplane had been set up

So thats the Air Scout is it Tom asked Mr Damon as he viewed
the machine

Yes thats the girl Air Scout is as good a name as any until I
see what shell do

It doesnt look different from one of your regular craft of the skies
Tom

No she isnt The main difference is here and Tom showed his friend
where a peculiar apparatus had been attached to the motor This was the
silencerthe whole secret of the invention so to speak

To Mr Damon it seemed to consist of an amazing collection of pipes
valves baffleplates chambers cylinders and reducers which took the
hot exhaust gases as they came from the motor and ate them up as he
expressed it

The cylinders too and the spark plugs are differently arranged in
the motor itself if you could see them said Tom to his friend But
the main work of cutting down the noise is done right here and he put
his hand on the steel case attached to the motor the case containing
the apparatus already briefly described

Well Im ready when you are Tom said Mr Damon

Well go as soon as its dark was the reply But first Ill give
you a demonstration Start the motor Jackson Tom called to his chief
helper

Mr Damon had ridden in aeroplanes before and had stood near when Tom
started them so he was prepared for a great rush of air as the
propellers whirled about and for deafening explosions from the engine

The big blades of new construction were turned until the gas in the
cylinders was sufficiently compressed Then Jackson stepped back out of
danger while Tom threw over the switch

Contact cried the young inventor

Jackson gave the blades a quarter pull and a moment later as he
leaped back out of the way they began to revolve with the swiftness of
light There was the familiar rush of air as the wooden wings cut
through the atmosphere but there was scarcely any noise Mr Damon
could hardly believe his ears

Im not running her at full speed said Tom If I did shed tear
loose from the holding blocks But you can see what little racket she
makes

Bless my fountain pen cried Mr Damon You are right Tom Swift
Why I can hear you talk almost as easily as if no engine were going
And I dont have to shout my head off either

This was perfectly true Tom could converse with Mr Damon in almost
ordinary tones The exhaust from the motor was nearly completely
muffled

Out in the air it will seem even more quiet said Tom Ill soon
give you a chance to verify that statement

He ran the engine a little longer the aeroplane quivering with the
vibrations but remaining almost silent

Im anxious to see what shell do when in motion said Tom as he
shut off the gas and spark

Soon after supper when the shades of evening were falling he and Mr
Damon took their places in the first of the Air Scouts to give it the
preliminary test in actual flying

Would Toms hopes be justified or would he be disappointed




CHAPTER XII

THE CRY FOR HELP


All ready Mr Damon asked Tom as he looked to see that all the
levers wheels valves and other controls were in working order on his
Air Scout

As ready as I ever shall be Tom was the answer I dont know why
it is but somehow I feel that something is going to happen on this
trip

Nonsense laughed Tom Youre nervous thats all

I suppose so Dont think Im going to back out or anything like
that but I wish it were successfully over with Tom Swift I most
certainly do

It will be in a little while returned Tom as he settled himself
comfortably in his seat and pulled the safety strap tight Youve gone
up in this same plane before when it didnt have the silent motor
aboard

Yes I know I have Oh I dare say it will be all right Tom And
yet somehow I cant help feeling

But Tom Swift felt that the best way to set Mr Damons premonitions to
rest was to start the motor and this he gave orders to have done
Jackson and some others of the men from the shops congregating about
the craft to see the beginning of the night flight Mr Swift was there
also and Eradicate Mary Nestor had been invited but her Red Cross
work engaged her that evening she said Ned Newton was away from town
on Liberty Bond business and he could not be present at the test

However as Tom expected to have other trials when his motor was in
even better shape he was not exactly sorry for the absence of his
friends

Contact called the young inventor when Jackson had stepped back
indicating it was time to throw over the switch

Let her go cried Tom and the next moment the motor was in
operation but so silently that his voice and that of Mr Damons could
easily be heard above the machinery

Good Tom Thats good cried Mr Swift and Tom easily heard his
fathers voice though under other and ordinary circumstances this
would have been impossible

True the hearing of Tom and Mr Damon was muffled to a certain extent
by the heavy leather and furlined caps they wore But Tom had several
small eyelet holes set into the flaps just over the opening of the
ears and these holes were sufficient to admit sounds while keeping
out most of the cold that obtains in the upper regions

The aeroplane moved swiftly along the level starting ground and away
from the lighted hangars Faster and faster it swung along as Tom
headed it into the wind and then as the speed of the motor increased
the Air Scout suddenly left the earth and went soaring aloft as she had
done before

But there was this difference She moved almost as silently as a great
owl which swoops down out of the darknessa bit of the velvety
blackness itself Up and up and onward and onward went the Air Scout
Tom Swifts improved silent motor urged it onward and as the young
inventor listened to catch the noise of the machinery his heart gave a
bound of hope For he could detect only very slight sounds

Shes a success exulted Tom to himself Shes a success but she
isnt perfect yet he added Ive got to make the muffler bigger and
put in more baffleplates Then I think I can turn the trick

He swung the machine out over the open country and then when they
were up at a height and sailing along easily he called back to Mr
Damon in the seat behind him

How do you like it

Great exclaimed the eccentric man Bless my postage stamp but its
great Why theres hardly a sound Tom and I can hear you quite
easily

And I can hear you added Tom I dont believe down below there
and he nodded toward the earth though Mr Damon could not see this as
the airship save for a tiny light over the instrument board was in
darkness they know that were flying over their heads

I agree with you was the answer Tom my boy I believe youve
solved the trick You have produced a silent aeroplane and now its up
to the government to make use of it

Im not quite ready for that yet replied the young inventor I
have several improvements to make But when they are finished Ill
let Uncle Sam know what I have Then its up to him

And you must be careful Tom that some of your rivals dont hear of
your success and get it away from you warned Mr Damon as Tom guided
the Air Scout along the aerial wayan unlighted and limitless path in
the silent darkness

Oh theyll have to get up pretty early in the morning to do that
boasted Tom and afterward he was to recall those words with a bit of
chagrin

On and on they sailed and as Tom increased the speed of the motor and
noted how silently it ran he began to have high hopes that he had
builded better than he knew For even with the motor running at almost
full speed there was not noise enough to hinder talk between himself
and Mr Damon

Of course there was some little sound Even the most perfect electric
motor has a sort of hum which can be detected when one is close to it
But at a little distance a great dynamo in operation appears to be
silence itself

I can go this one better though said Tom as he sailed along in the
night I see where Ive made a few mistakes in the baffle plate of the
silencer Ill correct that and

As he spoke the machine gave a lurch and the motor instead of
remaining silent began to cough and splutter as in the former days

Bless my rubber boots Tom whats the matter cried Mr Damon

Somethings gone wrong Tom answered barely able to hear and make
himself heard above the sudden noise Ill have to shut off the power
and glide down We can make a landing in this big field for just then
the moon came out from behind a cloud and Tom saw below them a great
meadow not far from the home of Mary Nestor He had often landed in
this same place

Something has broken in the muffler I think letting out some of the
exhaust he said to Mr Damon for now that the motor was shut off
Tom could speak in his ordinary tones Ill soon have it fixed or if
I cant we can go back in the old stylewith the machine making as
much racket as it pleases

So Tom guided the machine down It went silently now of course
making with the motor shut off no more sound than a falling leaf
Down to the soft springy turf in the green meadow Tom guided the
machine As it came to a stop and he and Mr Damon got out there was
borne to their ears a wild cry

Help Help




CHAPTER XIII

SOMETHING QUEER


Did you hear that asked Tom Swift of his companion

Hear it Bless my ear drums I should say I did hear it Some one is
in trouble Tom Caught in a bog most likely the same as that spy
chap who was at your place Thats itcaught in a bog

There isnt any bog or swamp around here Mr Damon If there was I
shouldnt have tried a landing No its something else besides that
Hark

Again the cry sounded seeming to come from a point behind the landing
place of the silent airship It was clear and distinct

Help Help They are

The voice seemed to die away in a gurgle as though the persons mouth
had been covered quickly

Hes sinking Tom Hes sinking cried Mr Damon I once heard a man
who almost drowned cry out and it sounded exactly like that

But there isnt any water around here for any one to drown in
declared Tom Its a big dry meadow I know where we are

Then what is it

I dont know but were going to find out Some one attacked by some
one elseor something I should say ventured the young inventor

Something do you mean a wild beast Tom

No for there arent any of those here any more than there is water
Though it may be that some farmers bull or a savage dog has got loose
and has attacked some traveler But in that case I think we would hear
bellows or barks and all I heard was a cry for help

The same with me Tom Lets investigate

Thats what I intend doing Come on The airship will be all right
until we come back

Better take a lighthadnt you Its dark even if the moon does show
now and then suggested Mr Damon

Guess you are right agreed Tom Aboard his airship there were
several small but powerful portable electric lights and after securing
one of these Tom and Mr Damon started for the spot whence the call for
help had come As they walked along their feet making no noise on the
soft turf they listened intently for a repetition of the call for aid

I dont hear anything said Tom after a bit

Nor I added Mr Damon We dont know exactly which way to go Tom

Thats right Guess wed better give him a hail whoever it is

Tom came to a halt and raising his voice to a shout called

Hello there Whats the matter Well help you if you can tell us
which way to come

They both listened intently but no voice answered them At the same
time however they were aware of a sound as of hurrying feet and
there seemed to be muttered imprecations not far away Tom and Mr
Damon looked in the direction of the sound and the young inventor
flashed his light But there was a clump of bushes and trees at that
point and the electrical rays did not penetrate very far

Some ones over there exclaimed Tom in a whisper Wed better go
and see what it is

All right agreed Mr Damon and he too spoke in a low voice

Why they did this when their previous talk had been in ordinary tones
and when Tom had shouted so loudly they did not stop to reason about
or explain just then But later they both admitted that they whispered
because they thought there was something wrong on footbecause they
feared a crime was being committed and they wanted to surprise the
perpetrators if they could

And it was this fact of their whispering that enabled the two to hear
something that otherwise they might not have heard And this was the
sound of some vehicle hurrying awayan automobile if Tom was any
judge The cries for help had been succeeded by stifled vocal sounds
and these in turn by the noise of wheels on the ground

What does it all mean asked Mr Damon in a whisper

I dont know answered Tom resolutely but weve got to find out
Come on

They advanced toward the dark clump of trees and low bushes There was
no need to be especially cautious in regard to being silent as their
feet made little if any sound on the deep grass And as Tom walked
in advance now and then flashing his light Mr Damon suddenly caught
him by the coat

What is it asked the young inventor

Look Just over the top of that hill where the moon shines Dont
you see an automobile outlined

Tom looked quickly

I do he answered Theres a road from here just the other side of
those trees to that hill The auto must have gone that way Well
theres no use in trying to follow it now Whoever it was has gotten
away

But they may have left some one behind Tom Wed better look in and
around those trees

I suppose we had but I dont believe well find anything I can
pretty nearly guess now what it was

What asked Mr Damon

Well some chauffeur was out for a ride in his employers car without
permission He got here had an accidentmaybe some friends he took
for a ride were hurt and they called for help The chauffeur knew if
there was any publicity hed be blamed and so he got away as quickly
as he could Guess the accidentif thats what it wasdidnt amount
to much or they couldnt have run the car off Weve had our trouble
for our pains

Well maybe youre right Tom Swift but all the same Id like to
have a look among those trees said Mr Damon

Oh well look all right assented Tom but I doubt if we find
anything

And he was right They walked in and about the little grove flashing
the light at intervals but beyond marks of auto wheels in the dust of
the road which was near the clump of maples there was nothing to
indicate what had happened

Though there was some sort of fracas declared Tom Look where the
dust is trampled down There were several men here perhaps skylarking
or perhaps it was a fight

Some one must have been hurt or they wouldnt have cried for help
said Mr Damon

Well thats so But perhaps it was some one not used to riding in
autos and he may have imagined the accident was worse than it was and
called for help involuntarily There is no evidence of any serious
accident having happenedno spots of blood at any rate and Tom
laughed at his own grimness It was a new car too or at least one
with new tires on

How do you know asked Mr Damon

Tell by the plain marks of the rubber tread in the dust was the
answer Look and Tom pointed to the wheel marks in the focus of his
electric lamp Its a new tire too with square protuberances on the
tread instead of the usual diamond or round ones A new kind of tire
all right

He and Mr Damon remained for a few minutes looking about the place
whence had come the calls for help and then the eccentric man remarked

Well as long as we cant do anything here Tom we might as well
travel on what do you say

I agree with you There isnt any use in staying Well get the Air
Scout fixed up and travel back home But this was something queer
mused Tom I hope it doesnt turn out later that a crime has been
committed and we didnt show enough gumption to prevent it

We couldnt prevent it We heard the cries as soon as we landed

Yes but if we had rushed over at once we might have caught the
fellows But I guess it was only a slight accident and some one was
more frightened than hurt Well have to let it go at that

But the more he thought about it the more Tom Swift thought there was
something queer in that weird cry for help on the lonely meadow in the
darkness of the night




CHAPTER XIV

THE TELEPHONE CALL


The defect in the motor which had caused Tom Swift to shut off the
power and drift down to earth was soon remedied once the young
inventor began an examination of the craft One of the oil feeds had
become choked and this automatically cut down the gasoline supply
causing one or more cylinders to miss It was a safety device Tom had
installed to prevent the motor running dry and so being damaged

Once the clogged oil feed was cleared the motor ran as before and just
as silently though as Tom had said he was not entirely satisfied
with the quietness but intended to do further work toward perfecting
it

Ill start the propellers now Mr Damon said Tom when the trouble
had been remedied You know how to throw the switch dont you

I guess so was the answer Mr Damon and Tom had traveled so often
together in gasoline craft that the young inventor had taught his
friend certain fundamentals about them and in an emergency the
eccentric man could help start an aeroplane This he now did taking
charge of the controls which could be operated from his seat as well as
from Toms Tom whirled the propellers and soon the motor was in
motion

Mr Damon once the big wooden blades were revolving slowed down the
apparatus until Tom could jump aboard after which the latter took
charge and soon speeded up the machine sending it aloft

As the green meadow dimly seen in the light of the moon seemed to
drop away below them and the clump of trees vanished from sight both
Tom and Mr Damon wondered who it was that had called for help and if
the matter were at all serious They were inclined to think it was not
but Tom could not rid himself of a faint suspicion that there might
have been trouble

However thoughts of his new silent Air Scout soon drove everything
else from his mind and as he guided the comparatively silent machine
on its quiet way toward his own home he was thinking how he could best
improve the muffler

Well here we are again safe and sound remarked Tom as he brought
the craft to a stop in front of the hangar and Jackson and his
helpers who were awaiting the return hurried out to take charge

Yes everything seems to point to success Tom agreed Mr Damon
That is unless the slight accident we had means trouble

Oh no that had nothing to do with the operation of the silencer But
Im going to do better yet Some day Ill take you for a ride in a
silent machine which will make so little noise that you can hear a pin
drop

Well remarked Mr Damon with a laugh I dont know that listening
to falling pins will give me any great amount of pleasure Tom but I
appreciate your meaning

Everything all right asked Mr Swift as he came out to hear the
details from his son Do you think you have solved the problem

Not completely but Ill soon be able to write Q E D after it Some
refinements are all that are needed Dad

Glad to hear it I was a bit anxious

Mr Swift questioned his son about the technical details of the trip
asking how the motor had acted under the pressure caused by so
completely muffling the exhaust and for some minutes the two
inventors young and old indulged in talk which was not at all
interesting to Mr Damon They went into the house and Tom asked to
have a little lunch which Mrs Baggert set out for him

Its rather late to eat said the young inventor but I always feel
hungry after I test a new machine and find that it works pretty well
Will you join me in a sandwich or two Mr Damon

Why bless my ketchup bottle I believe I will

And so they ate and talked Tom was on the point of telling his father
something of the queer cry for help they had heard on the lonely meadow
when Mrs Baggert produced a letter which she said had come for Tom
that afternoon but had been mislaid by a new maid who had been engaged
to help with the housework

She took it to the shop after you had left and only now told me about
it explained Mrs Baggert So I sent Eradicate for it

How long ago was that asked Tom as he took the missive

Oh an hour ago answered Mrs Baggert with a smile But dont
blame poor Rad for that He wanted to deliver the letter to you
personally and so did Koku The result was your giant kept after Rad
trying to get the letter from him and Rad kept hiding and slinking
about for a chance to see you himself until I saw what was going on a
little while ago and took the letter myself Else you might never have
gotten it so jealous are those two and Mrs Baggert laughed

Guess it isnt of much importance Tom said as he tore open the
envelope Its from the Universal Flying Machine Company of New York
and I imagine theyre trying to get me to reconsider my refusal to link
up with them

Yes he went on as he read the missive thats it Theyve raised
the amount to thirty thousand a year now Dad and they say they feel
sure I shall regret it if I do not accept

This is a bit queer though went on the young inventor This
letter was written three days ago but it reached Shopton only today
And it says that unless they hear from me at once they will have to
take steps that will cause me great inconvenience They have nerve at
any rate and impudence too I wont even bother to answer But I
wonder what they mean and why this letter was delayed

The mails are all late on account of the transportation congestion
caused by moving troops to the camps said Mr Damon Some of my
letters are delayed a week But as you say Tom these fellows are
very impudent to threaten that way

Its all bluff declared Tom Im not worrying And now Dad since
Ive almost reached the top of the hill with my Air Scout I may be
able to help you on that new electric motor youre puzzling over

I wish you would Tom I am trying to invent a new system of
interchangeable brush contacts but so far Ive been unable to make
them work However there is no great hurry about that If you are
going to offer your silent machine to the government finish that first
We need all the aircraft we can get The battles on the other side seem
to be all in favor of the Germans so far

We havent got into our stride yet declared Mr Damon Once Uncle
Sam gets the boys over there in force therell be a different story to
tell I only wish

At that moment the telephone set up an insistent ringing breaking in
on Mr Damons remarks

Ill answer said Tom as Mrs Baggert moved toward the instrument
which was an extension from the main one

Hello called the young inventor into the transmitter and as he
received an answer a look of pleasure came over his face

Yes Mary this is Tom he said He remained silent a moment while
it was evident he was listening to the voice at the other end of the
wire Then he suddenly exclaimed

Whats that Tell him to come home Why he isnt here I just came in
andwhatwait a minute

With a rather strange look on his face Tom covered the mouthpiece of
the instrument with his hand and turning to his father asked

Is Mr Nestor here

No replied Mr Swift slowly He was here though He came a little
while after you and Mr Damon started off in the Air Scout But he
didnt stay Said he wanted to see you about something and would call
again

Oh remarked the young man I didnt know he had been there

I meant to tell you said Mrs Baggert but getting the lunch made
me forget it I guess

Tom uncovered the transmitter of the telephone again and spoke to Mary
Nestor

Hello he said I was wrong Mary Your father was here but he left
when he found I wasnt at home How long ago Wait a minute and Ill
inquire

How long ago did Mr Nestor leave asked the young inventor of the
housekeeper Nearly an hour he said into the instrument after he
had received the answer Then after listening a moment he added
Yes I guess hell be home soon now Probably stopped down town to see
some of his friends Yes Mr Damon and I tried out the Air Scout Yes
she worked pretty well for a starter but there is something yet to be
done Oh yes now Ill have time to come over to see you and take you
for a ride too We wont have to talk through a speaking tube either
Tell your father I am sorry I was out when he called Ill come to see
him tomorrow if he wants me to Yesyes I guess so and Tom
laughed it being evident that his remarks at the end of the
conversation had to do with personal matters

A telegram has come for Mr Nestor and they were anxious that he
should get it Tom explained to his little audience as he hung up the
receiver and put aside the telephone I wonder what he wanted to see
me about

He didnt say replied Mrs Baggert

Mr Damon Tom and his father remained in conversation a little while
longer and the eccentric man was thinking that it was about time for
him to return home when the telephone rang again

Hello answered Tom as he was nearest the instrument Oh yes
Mary this is he Whats that Your father hasnt reached home yet And
your mother is worried Oh tell her there is no cause for alarm As I
said he probably stopped on his way to see some friends

Tom listened for perhaps half a minute to a talk that was inaudible to
the others in the room and they noticed a grave look come over his
face Then he said

Ill be right over Mary Yes Ill come at once And tell your mother
not to worry Im sure nothing could have happened Ill be with you
in a jiffy

As Tom Swift hung up the receiver he said

Mr Nestor hasnt reached home yet and as he promised to return at
once in case he didnt find me his wife is much worried Ill go over
and see what I can do

Ill come along volunteered Mr Damon It isnt late yet

Yes do come urged Tom But I suppose when we get there well find
our friend has arrived safely Well go over in the electric runabout




CHAPTER XV

A VAIN SEARCH


Tom Swifts speedy little electric car was soon at the door in
readiness to take him and Mr Damon to the Nestor home The electric
runabout was a machine Tom had evolved in his early inventive days and
though he had other automobiles none was quite so fast or so simple to
run as this which well merited the name of the most rapid machine on
the road In it Tom had once won a great race as has been related in
the book bearing the title Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout

Mary didnt telephone again did she Tom asked his father as he
stopped at the house to get Mr Damon having gone out to see about
getting the electric runabout in readiness

No was the answer The telephone hasnt rung since

Then I guess Mr Nestor cant have arrived home said Tom Its a
bit queer his delay but Im sure it will be explained naturally Only
Mary and her mother are alone and very likely theyre nervous Ill
telephone to let you know everything is all right as soon as I get
there Tom promised his father and Mrs Baggert as he drove off down
the road partly illuminated by the new moon

Rapidly and almost as silently as his Air Scout Tom Swift drove the
speedy car down the highway It was about three miles from his home to
that of Mary Nestor and though the distance was quickly covered to
Tom at least the space seemed interminable But at length he drove
up to the door There were lights in most of the rooms which was
unusual at this time of night

The sound of the wheels had not ceased echoing on the gravel of the
drive before Mary was out on the porch which she illuminated by an
overhead light

Oh Tom she cried he hasnt come yet and we are so worried Did
you see anything of father as you came along

No was Toms answer But we didnt look for him along the road as
we came by the turnpike and he wouldnt travel that way But he will
be along at any moment now You must remember its quite a walk from my
house and

But he was on his bicycle said Mary We wanted him to go in the
auto but he said he wanted some exercise after supper and he went
over on his wheel He said hed be right back but he hasnt come yet

Oh he will said Tom reassuringly He may have had a puncture or
something like that Bicyclists are just as liable to them as
autoists he added with a laugh

Well Im sure I hope it will be all right sighed Mary I wish you
could convince mother to that effect Shes as nervous as a cat Come
in and tell us what to do

Oh hell be all right declared Mr Damon adding his assurances to
Toms

They found Mrs Nestor verging on an attack of hysteria Though Mr
Nestor often went out during the evening he seldom stayed late

And he said hed be right back if he found you werent at home Tom
said Mrs Nestor Im sure I dont know what can be keeping him

Its too soon to get worried yet replied the young inventor
cheerfully Ill wait a little while and then if he doesnt come
Mr Damon and I will go back over the road and look carefully He may
have had a slight fallsprained his ankle or something like thatand
not be able to ride We came by the turnpike a road he probably
wouldnt take on his wheel Hes all right you may be sure of that

Tom tried to speak reassuringly but somehow he did not believe
himself He was beginning to think more and more how strange it was
that Mr Nestor did not return home

Well wait just a bit longer before setting out on a search he told
Mary and her mother But Im sure he will be along any minute now

They went into the library Mary and her mother Tom and Mr Damon And
there they sat waiting Tom tried to entertain Mary and Mrs Nestor
with an account of his trial trip in the Air Scout but the two women
scarcely heard what he said

All sat watching the clock and looking from that to the telephone
which they tried to hope would ring momentarily and transmit to them
good news Then they would listen for the sound of footsteps or bicycle
wheels on the gravel walk But they heard nothing and as the seconds
were ticked off on the clock the nervousness of Mrs Nestor increased
until she exclaimed

I can stand it no longer We must notify the policeor do something

I wouldnt notify the police just yet counseled Tom Mr Damon and
I will start out and look along the road If it should happen as will
probably turn out to be the case that Mr Nestor has met with only a
simple accident he would not like the notoriety or publicity of
having the police notified

No I am sure he would not agreed Mary Toms way is best Mother

All right just as you say only find my husband and Mrs Nestor
sighed and turned her head away

Even if Mr Nestor had had a fall reasoned Tom he could call for
help and get some one to telephone unless

And as he reasoned thus Tom Swift gave a mental start at his own use of
the word help

That weird cry on the lonely meadow came back to him with startling
distinctness

Come on Mr Damon cried Tom in a voice he tried to make cheerful
Well find that Mr Nestor is probably walking along carrying his
disabled bicycle instead of having it carry him Well soon have him
safe back to you he called to the two women

I wish I could go with you and help search observed Mary

Oh I couldnt bear to be left alone exclaimed her mother

Well telephone as soon as we find him called Tom to Mrs Nestor as
he and Mr Damon again got into the runabout and started away from the
place

What do you think of it Tom asked the eccentric man when they were
once more on the road

Why nothing muchas yet Tom said That is I think nothing more
than a simple accident has happened if indeed it is anything more
than that he has delayed to talk to some friends

Would he delay this long

I dont know

And then Tombless my spectacles what of that cry we heard Could
that have been Mr Nestor

There It was out The suspicion that Tom had been trying to keep his
mind away from came to the fore Well he might as well race the issue
now as later

Ive been thinking of that he told Mr Damon It might have been
Marys father calling for help

But we looked Tom near the trees and couldnt discover anything If
he had been calling for help

Mr Damon did not finish

He may have fallen from his wheel and been hurt said Tom as he
turned the electric runabout into the highway that Mr Nestor would
most likely have taken on his way from Shopton Then he may have
called for help and some autoists passing may have heard and taken
him away

Yes but where Tom Whoever called for help was taken away thats
sure But where

To some hospital I suppose

Then hadnt we better inquire there There are only two hospitals of
any account around here The one in Shopton and the one in Waterfield
My wife is on the board of Lady Managers there We could call that
hospital up and

Well look along the road first said Tom If we begin to make
inquiries at the hospitals there will be a lot of questions asked and
a general alarm may be sent out Mr Nestor wouldnt like that if he
isnt in any danger And it may turn out that he has met an old friend
and has been talking with him all this while forgetting all about the
passage of time

They were now driving along the highway that led from the little suburb
where Mr Nestor lived to the main part of Shopton just beyond which
was Toms home This section was countrylike with very few houses and
those placed at rather infrequent intervals The road was a good one
though not the maintraveled one and Mr Nestor as was known
frequently used it when he rode his bicycle an exercise of which he
was very fond

As Tom and Mr Damon drove along they scanned as best they could in
the light from the young moon and the powerful lamps on the runabout
every part of the highway They were looking for some dark blot which
might indicate where a man had fallen from his wheel and was lying in
some huddled heap on the road But they saw nothing like this much to
their relief

Do you know Tom said Mr Damon when they were nearing the town
and their search thus far had been in vain I think were going at
this the wrong way

Why so

Because Mr Nestor may have fallen and been hurt and have been
carried into any one of a dozen houses along the road In that case we
wouldnt see him Weve passed over the most lonely part of the journey
and havent seen him If the accident occurred near the houses his
cries would have brought some one out to help him He is well known
around here and even if he were unconscious and couldnt tell who he
was he could be identified by papers in his pockets Then his family
would be notified by telephone

Perhaps you are right Mr Damon We may be wasting time this way
What do you suggest asked Tom

That we dont delay any longer but call up the hospitals at once If
he isnt in either of those he must be in some house and in such
condition that his identity cannot be established In that event it is
a case for the police We havent found him and I think we had better
give the alarm

Tom Swift thought it over for a moment Then he came to a sudden
decision

Youre right he told Mr Damon We mustnt waste any more time He
isnt along the road he ought to have traveled in coming from my house
to his homethats sure But before I call up the hospitals I want to
try out one more idea

Whats that Tom

I want to go to the place where we heard that cry for help

Do you think that could have been Mr Nestor

It may have been Well go and take another look around there Some
man was evidently hurt there and was taken away We may get a clew
The lights on the runabout will give us a better chance to look around
than we had by the little pocket lamp Well try there and if we
dont find anything then Ill call up the hospitals




CHAPTER XVI

THE LONG NIGHT


With the speedy runabout it did not take Tom Swift and Mr Damon long
to reach the place where the Air Scout had been grounded a few hours
before and where they had heard the cry for help All was as dark and
as silent as when they had been there before

But as Tom had said the lights from his electric runabout would give
a brilliant illumination and these he now directed toward the clump of
trees whence the cry for help had seemed to come

Doesnt appear to have been visited by any one since we were here
remarked Tom as he observed the marks of the new automobile tire in
the dust Now well look about more carefully

This they did but they were about to give up in despair and start for
the nearest telephone to call up the hospitals when Mr Damon gave an
exclamation

What is it asked Tom

Something bright and shining said his companion I saw it gleam in
the light of the lamps You nearly put your foot on it Tom Just step
back a moment

Tom did so and the eccentric man with another exclamation this time
of satisfaction reached down and picked something up from the dusty
road

Its a watch he exclaimed A gold watch And its been stepped on
evidently or run over by an auto Not much damaged but the case is a
bit bent and scratched Its stopped too he added as he held it to
his ear

What time does it show asked Tom

Eight fortyseven answered Mr Damon as he consulted the dial
Why Tom that was just about when we heard the cries for help

Yes it must have been Let me see that watch

No sooner had the young inventor taken the timepiece into his hands
than he too uttered a cry of amazement

Do you recognize it asked Mr Damon in great excitement

Its Mr Nestors watch cried Tom He must have fallen here and
been hurt It was Mr Nestor who cried for help and who was taken away
by the autoists Theyve probably taken him to some hospital Theres
been an accident all right

Tom and Mr Damon were of one mind now in thinking that Mr Nestor had
met with some mishap on the roadan automobile accident most
likelyand that he was the person who had called for help

If they had only answered when we hallooed at them said Tom we
wouldnt be in all this stew now We could have told the strangers who
came to his aid who he was and we might even have taken him to the
hospital in the airship

Well its too late to think of that now returned Mr Damon We
had better get into communication with him as soon as we can and then
send word to his wife and daughter I hope he isnt badly hurt

Tom hoped so too with all his heart

There was nothing to do but to get back in the runabout and make all
speed for the nearest telephone and Tom Swift lost little time in
doing this They found a drug store which was open a little later than
usual and at once Tom went into the booth and called up the Shopton
hospital He was well known there as he and his father were liberal
supporters of the institution which was a private affair Many of
Toms men were treated at the dispensary and as accidents were of
more or less frequent occurrence at the works the young inventor had
frequent occasions to call up the place

Mr Nestor would ask to be taken there as its nearest his homethat
is if he was able to speak Tom said to Mr Damon who agreed with
him There was a little delay in getting the hospital on the wire but
when Tom had it and was talking to the superintendent he was rather
surprised to tell the truth to be told that Mr Nestor had not been
brought in

We havent had any accident cases all day nor tonight Mr Swift
the superintendent reported Was this some one special you were
inquiring about

For Tom determining not to give Mr Nestors name except as a last
resort had merely inquired whether any recent accident cases had been
brought in

Ill let you know later Mr Millard he told the superintendent not
exactly answering the question He hung up the receiver and opening
the door of the booth said to Mr Damon He isnt there

Then try Waterfield was the suggestion and Tom did so though he
could not imagine why an injured man such as Mr Nestor might prove to
be should be taken as far as Waterfield when the hospital at Shopton
was nearer

Unless he told Mr Damon the people which ran down Marys father
didnt know about our hospital

The reply from the institution in Mr Damons home town was just as
discouraging as had been the answer from Shopton At first when Tom
inquired the head nurse had said there was an accident case at that
moment being brought in Tom was all excitement until she went to
inquire the name and circumstances and then he learned that it was the
case of a little boy who had fallen downstairs at his home and broken a
leg There was no record of any one answering the description of Mr
Nestor having been brought in that evening

Hum This is getting to be mysterious mused Tom as he came out of
the booth What shall we dogo back and tell Mrs Nestor and Mary or
communicate with the police

Why not try the Alexian Hospital asked Mr Damon Thats away over
in Centerford to be sure but its more likely to be known to
passing tourists than either of our institutions around here
especially if the autoists were strangers

Thats so agreed Tom The Alexian Hospital was operated under the
direction of the Brothers of that faith and was well known in that
part of the state Often cases of persons who had been injured by
passing automobiles had been taken there for treatment for as Mr
Damon had said it was well known and Centerford was the nearest large
city

I can just about see how it happened said Tom They ran Mr Nestor
down and stopped to pick him up after they heard his cries for help
And the Alexian Hospital was the first one they thought of We should
have called that up first

But once more disappointment awaited the young inventor and his friend
Word came back over the wire that no accident case which bore any
resemblance to Marys father had been brought in

Well Im stumped exclaimed Tom What shall we do now Mr Damon

Much as I dislike it said the eccentric man who was too much
worried now to do any blessing which was his favorite expression
I think we ought to communicate with Mrs Nestor She will be very
anxious

I guess well have to said Tom But wait Ill call up my house
first and see if he has gone back there

But Mr Nestor had not done this and Mrs Baggert who answered the
telephone said Mary had been calling frantically for Tom as her
mother was now on the verge of complete collapse

No help for it said Tom ruefully Weve got to tell em we have no
news and cant find him

And hearing this Mrs Nestor did collapse and a doctor was called in

Thereupon Tom who with Mr Damon had gone back to the Nestor home
took charge of matters sending for Mrs Nestors sister to come and
stay with her and take charge of the house

Youll need some one to stay with you he told Mary

Yes I shall she admitted trying bravely not to give way to her
emotion Oh Tom I wish you could stay too Im sure something
dreadful must have happened to poor father Please stay and help us
find him

I will Tom promised As soon as your aunt comes Ill take Mr Damon
home and then Ill give the rest of my time to you

And this Tom did sending word home that he would remain at the
Nestors all night and part of the next day

Tom got but little sleep that night He communicated with the police
and saw to it that a general alarm was sent out He called up all
hospitals within a radius of fifty miles but could get no trace of any
injured man whose description resembled that of Mr Nestor

What can have happened asked Mary tearfully

Well the way I figure it out is this said Tom Your father left my
house soon after Mr Damon and I did in the Air Scout Mr Nestor was
riding his bicycle and he must have been run into by an automobile
That is how his watch was damaged and that was when Mr Damon and I
heard the cries for help

Oh do you think he was badly hurt asked Mary

No I dont and Tom answered truthfully The voice sounded as
though he was in pain certainly but it was strong and vigorous and
not at all as though he was dangerously hurt

And what do you think happened to him after he was hurt asked Mary

The autoists took him away decided Tom In fact we heard the
machine go but of course we never connected the call for help and what
followed with your father The autoists took him away

Where

I should say to some hospital Perhaps a private one of which we know
nothing and which may be near here Ill get a full list from the
Board of Health tomorrow Or it may be that the autoists seeing the
damage they had done took your father to the home of one of
themselves and summoned a doctor there

Why would they do that

Well they may have been so frightened they didnt realize what they
were doing or they may have thought he would get better treatment in a
private house if he were not badly injured than if he should be taken
to a hospital It may have been that one of the persons in the auto was
a physician and wished to try his own skill on the man he had hurt

You make me feel more comfortable Tom said Mary But even
supposing all this why couldnt they telephone to us that my father
was all right He always carries an identification card with him and
if he were unconscious it could be ascertained who he was

Thats what I cant understand said Tom frankly It puzzles me But
well find himnever fear

And so he kept on with his telephone inquiries while a physician and
her sister ministered to Mrs Nestor The night was very very long
and no good news came in




CHAPTER XVII

SILENT SAM


Slowly the dawn broke through the mists of darkness and made the earth
light The sun came straggling in through cracks in the shutters in the
home of Mr Nestor the gradually increasing gleam paling the electric
lights in the glare of which Tom Swift Mary and her aunt sat
waiting for some word of the missing man But none came

What shall we do now asked Mary as she looked at Tom

Oh theres lots to do he said trying to make his voice sound
cheerful Well be busy all day I sent word to have one of my touring
cars ready to hurry to any part of the country the moment we should get
word from your father

And do you think we shall get word Tom the girl went on wistfully

Of course we shall he cried Word may come in at any time Now get
ready eat a good breakfast and then you can go with me as soon as we
hear anything definite Come well have breakfast

I cant eat a thing protested Mary

Oh yes you can said her aunt who was a cheerful sort of person
Ill see about getting something for you and Mr Swift and see that
your mother is all right

She left the room to give orders to the servant about the meal and
returned to say that Mrs Nestor was sleeping quietly She had been
given a sedative Mary managed to eat a little and she gave Tom the
address of several friends who were called up in the vain hope that
somehow Mr Nestor might have gone to see them

Tom what do you really think has happened asked Mary again as they
sat facing one another in the library during a respite from the
telephone

Tom Swift repeated to the girl his theory of what had happened with an
assumption of confidence he did not altogether feel

His prediction of a speedy end to the suspense did not come true that
day nor for many days No news was heard of Mr Nestor After the
first day when there was no information and when no reports came of
any one of his description having been hurt in an automobile accident
or having been taken to any hospital the police started an energetic
search

The authorities in all nearby cities were notified and all thought of
keeping from the public what had happened was given over Toms story
of how he and Mr Damon had heard the cry for help on the lonely
meadow was printed in the papers though the young inventor did not
say that he had been out trying his new aeroplane That was a detail
not needed in the finding of Mr Nestor

But Marys father was not found The mystery regarding his
disappearance deepened and there was no trace of him after he had left
Toms house that eventful evening Persons living along the roads he
might have taken in riding his bicycle were questioned but they had
seen nothing of him nor were they aware of any accident Toms
testimony and that of Mr Damon was all the clew there was

I dont believe hes dead stoutly declared the young inventor when
this dire possibility had been hinted at I believe the persons who
were responsible for the accident are afraid to reveal his whereabouts
until he recovers from possible injuries Youll see Mr Nestor will
come back safe

And somehow though her mother was skeptical Mary believed what Tom
said

The search was kept up but without result and Tom aided all he could
But there was not much he could do The police and other authorities
were at a total loss

In the intervals of visiting Mary and her mother and doing what he
could for them Tom worked on his new motor He knew that he was on the
right track and that all that was needed now was to make certain
refinements and adjustments in the apparatus he had already
constructed so that it would operate more quietly

Absorbing the vibrations from the exhaust caused by the exploded
gases in the cylinders does the trick Tom told his father

But there is enormous pressure to overcome Tom You must be sure your
muffler will stand the strain Otherwise she is going to blow out a
gasket some day when you least expect it Then the sudden resumption
of pressure outside the cylinders is going to cause a change in the
equilibrium and you may turn turtle in the air

Ive thought of that said Tom At worst it cant be any more than
looping the loop But Ill make the muffler doubly strong

Better provide an auxiliary chamber to take care of part of the
exhaust in case your main apparatus breaks advised the older
inventor and Tom said he would He did too for he valued his
fathers expert advice

Meanwhile he was busy fitting one of his latest aeroplanes with the new
motor The motor he and Mr Damon had used in their flight was one
patched up from an old one But now Tom was working on a complete new
one made after his revised model and in which the silencer was an
integral part instead of being built on

While giving Mary and her mother all the assistance in his power Tom
still found time to work on his new pet scheme He had matters now
where he did not fear any tampering with his plans for he had filed
away his papers in a safe place and was making his new machine from
memory

But if some one got in and had a look at the inside of your silencer
he could see how it is constructed couldnt he asked Ned Newton

Yes assented Tom But theyre not going to get in very easily Koku
sleeps in the experiment shop now and my machine is there

Oh well that explains your confidence I feel sorry for the burglar
who makes the attempt once Koku wakes up Heard anything more from
those Universal people

No not directly I understand they are working hard on some new type
of plane for army use but I havent bothered my head about them Im
too much occupied with my own affairs and trying to help Mary

Very strange about Mr Nestor isnt it

Worse than strange said Tom If this keeps on and he isnt heard
from it will be tragic pretty soon

He must be held a prisoner somewhere declared Ned

It begins to look that way assented Tom Though who would have an
object in that I cant understand He had no enemies as far as is
known and his business affairs were in excellent shape Unless as I
said the persons who ran him down are through fear keeping him
hidden until he recovers I cant imagine what has become of him

Well it certainly is a puzzle said Ned And Tom agreed with his
chum

It was about a week after the disappearance of Mr Nestor that Mr
Damon came over to see Tom

Bless my shoe laces Tom exclaimed the eccentric man but you are
as busy as ever For he found the young inventor in the experiment
shop surrounded by a mass of papers and all sorts of mechanical
devices

Yes Im working a little said Tom But you are just in time Come
on out I want to introduce you to Silent Sam

Silent Sam exclaimed Mr Damon Have you been taking a new trip
to the Land of Wonders Have you brought back some new kind of servant

Not exactly a servant said Tom with a laugh though I hope Silent
Sam will serve me well

Silent Sam What does it mean Is that a joke asked the puzzled
Mr Damon

I hope it doesnt turn out a joke replied Tom But come on Ill
introduce you to him Mr Damon

He led the way to one of the big hangars where his various machines of
the air were housed On the way Mr Damon asked about news of Mr
Nestor but was told there was none

Tom Swift opened the big swinging doors and pulled aside an enveloping
canvas curtain There stood revealed a big aeroplane of somewhat new
pattern the wings gleaming like silver from the varnish that had been
applied In shape it was not unlike the machines already in use except
that the propellers were of somewhat different design

The engine was mounted in front and even with his slight knowledge of
mechanics Mr Damon could tell that it was exceedingly powerful But it
was certain devices attached to the engine that attracted his
attention for they were totally different from any on any other
aeroplane though they bore some resemblance to apparatus on the plane
in which Tom and the eccentric man had made the night flight

Is this your new machine Tom asked Mr Damon

Yes

Well I dont see anything of that fellow you spoke ofSilent Sam

This is Silent Sam returned Tom with a laugh Ive named my new
noiseless aeroplanemy Air ScoutIve named that Silent Sam Wait
until you hear it or rather dont hear it and I think youll agree
with me Silent Sam for Uncle Sam

Good cried Mr Damon Bless my dictionary but thats a good name
Does it sail silently Tom

Ill let you judge presently Silent Sam is all ready for his first
trial and Ill be glad to have you with me Now Ill just

Tom suddenly ceased speaking and held up a hand to enjoin silence
Then while Mr Damon watched the young inventor began moving
noiselessly toward the rear of the big shed inside which was his new
machine




CHAPTER XVIII

SUSPICIONS


Whos there suddenly called Tom and in such a sharp voice that Mr
Damon started ready as he was for something unusual

There was no answer and Tom suddenly switched on all the lights in the
shed Up to then there had been only a few glowingjust enough for him
to show the new Air Scout to his friend

Whos there asked Tom again sharply

Bless my opera glasses Tom cried Mr Damon but are you seeing
things

No but Im hearing them answered Tom with a short laugh Did you
think you heard some one moving around near the rudders of Silent Sam
Mr Damon

No I cant say that I did Everything seems to me to be all right

Well it doesnt to me went on Tom grimly I think there is an
intruder in this shed though how any one could get in when the doors
have been locked all day is more than I can figure out But Im going
to have a look

Ill help you offered Mr Damon and in the bright glare from many
electric lights the two began a search of the big hangar where the new
craft was kept

But though the young inventor and his friend went around to the rear of
the aeroplane walking in opposite directions they saw no one nor did
any one try to escape past them

And yet I was sure I heard some one in here declared Tom when a
search had revealed nothing It sounded as if some one were scuffling
softly about in rubbersoled shoes trying to hide

Bless my suspenders cried Mr Damon who do you think it could have
been Tom

Who else but some spy trying to get possession of my secrets was the
answer But I guess I was too quick for them They couldnt learn much
from looking at the outside of my muffler and it hasnt been
disturbed as far as I can see

Who would want to gain a knowledge of it in that unlawful way asked
Mr Damon

Perhaps some of the Universal crowd They may have been disappointed
in perfecting a silent motor themselves and think stealing my idea
would be the easiest way out of it

Do they know you are working on such a model as this Silent Sam of
yours Tom

Yes I imagine they do One of the firm members as you recall
overheard something I think that gave them a hint as to what my plans
were though thanks to the time I fooled the spy they havent any
real data to go by I believe

Let us hope not said Mr Damon

Tom and he made a thorough search of the big shed but found no one
nor was there any trace of an intruder Tom notified Jackson who in
turn told the guards and watchmen to be on the lookout for any
suspicious strangers but none was seen in the vicinity of the Swift
works

Well everything seems to be all right so well have the test
remarked Tom after a further search of the premises Now Mr
Damon if all goes as I hope you will see what my new machine can do
Strain your ears for a sound and let me know how much you hear

His men helping him Tom started the new motor which was tried for the
first time attached to the new craft No flight was to be made yet the
motor being tested as though on the block though in reality the
craft was ready for instant flight if need be

Slowly the great propellers began to revolve and then Tom taking his
place in the cockpit turned on more power The new craftSilent
Samwas made fast so it could not progress even though the propellers
revolved at high speed

Im not sending her to the limit said Tom to his friend as the
young inventor throttled down the motor If I did Id tear her loose
from the holding blocks

Her cried Mr Damon Bless my typewriter Tom but I thought Silent
Sam was a gentleman aeroplane

So he is laughed the young man frankly I forgot about Silent
Sam Guess Ill have to say him instead of her though the latter
sounds more natural Anyhow what do you think

I think its wonderful exclaimed Mr Damon There the motor is
going at almost full speed and I can hardly hear a thing You can the
easier believe that when I say that I can hear you talk perfectly well
And I guess you hear me dont you

Yes replied Tom And we dont have to shout either This is the
best test ever I think everything is a success

Are you going to take her aloft Tom the eccentric man went on

Yes now that Im sure the engine is all right Will you go for a
flight with me

I certainly will I only wish we could find him though Id go with a
better heart

Oh Mr Nestor

Yes I cant imagine what has become of him It is almost as if the
earth had opened and swallowed him His disappearance is a great
mystery

It surely is agreed Tom Cant seem to get any trace of him But if
we hear another cry for help when we have to land you can make up
your mind Ill investigate more quickly than I did at first

I agree with you said Mr Damon

It was nearly evening then and until it was dark enough for his flight
Tom spent the time tuning up the engine and seeing that all was in
readiness for the latest test He had decided not to go aloft while it
was light enough for curiosity seekers to note the flight

Tom rather wished Mary Nestor might have a sail with him in his latest
improved silent Air Scout but the girl was too much occupied at home
and in trying to find some trace of her father

Tom his father and Mr Damon had helped all they could but there
were no results A private detective had been engaged but he had no
more of a clew than the regular police

At last it was dark enough for the flight and Tom and Mr Damon took
their places in the machine Once more the propellers were turned
around and when the compression had been made and the spark switched
on around spun the big wooden blades and the great craft moved over
the grass

On and on and up and up sailed Tom and Mr Damon and as they left
behind them the shops and the Swift homestead the two passengers were
aware of their almost silent flight The big aeroplane the exhaust of
which ordinarily would have nearly deafened them was now as silent
as a bird

Silent Sam for Uncle Sam cried Tom in delight as he went on faster
Im sure the government ought to be glad to get this plane for air
scout work Its a success A great success

Yes so it is agreed Mr Damon You do well to speak of it so Tom

For modest as the young inventor was he felt in justice to himself
that he must acknowledge the fact that his craft was a success For it
rose and sailed almost as silently as a bat and a few hundred feet
away no one not seeing it would have believed a big aeroplane was in
motion

Tom and Mr Damon flew about twenty miles at a swift pace and all the
fault Tom had to find was that the machine was not as steady in flight
as she should have been

But I can remedy that with the use of some of dads gyroscope
stabilizers he told Mr Damon

They returned to the hangar safely and the first trip of the new
Silent Sam was an assured success

It was the following day when Tom was busy in the machine shop
installing the gyroscopes spoken of that Jackson came to tell him
there was a visitor to see him

Who is it asked the young inventor

Mr Gale of the Universal Company was the answer

I dont want to see him declared Tom quickly I have nothing to say
to him after his clumsy threats

He seems very much in earnest said Jackson Better see him if only
for a minute or so

All right I will assented Tom Show him in

Mr Gale as blusteringly bluff as ever entered the shop Tom had
carefully put away all papers and models as well as the finished
machines so he had no fear that his visitor might discover some secret

Oh Mr Swift began the president of the Universal Company when he
met the young inventor I wish to assure you that what has been done
was entirely without our knowledge And though this man may have acted
as our agent at one time we repudiate any acts of his that might

What are you talking about asked Tom in surprise Have I been so
impolite as to sleep during part of your talk I dont understand what
you are driving at

Oh I thought you did said Gale and he showed surprise I
understood that the man who

Do you mean there was some one here in the shed last night cried the
young inventor suddenly all his suspicions aroused

Some one here last night repeated Mr Gale No I dont refer to
last night But perhaps I am making a mistake IerI

Some one is making a mistake said Tom significantly




CHAPTER XIX

ANOTHER FLIGHT


For perhaps a quarter of a minute Tom Swift and the president of the
Universal Flying Machine Company of New York sat staring at one
another Mr Gales face wore a puzzled expression and so did Toms
And after the last remark of the young inventor the man who had
called to see him said

Well perhaps we are talking at cross purposes I dont blame you for
not feeling very friendly toward us and if I had had my way that last
correspondence with you would never have left our office

It wasnt very businesslike said Tom dryly referring to the veiled
threats when he had refused to sell his services to the rival company

I realize that said Mr Gale But we have some peculiar men working
for us and sometimes there is so much to do so many possibilities of
which to take advantage that we may get a little off our balance But
what I called for was not to renew our offer to you I understand that
is definitely settled

As far as I am concerned it is said Tom as his caller seemed to
want an answer

Yes Well then what I called to say was that if you are thinking of
taking any legal action against us because of the action of that man
Lydane I wish to state that he had absolutely no authority to

Excuse me broke in Tom but by Lydane do you mean the man who also
posed as Bower the spy

No I do not Though I regret to say that Bower once worked for us
He too had no authority to come here and get a position He was still
in our service when he did that

So I have suspected said Tom I realize now that he was a spy who
came here to try to find out for you some of my secrets

Not with my permission exclaimed Mr Gale I was against that from
the first and I came to tell you so But Bower really did you no harm

No he didnt get the chance chuckled Tom Nor did that other
spythe one with the gold tooth I wonder how he liked our mud hole

He was Lydane said Mr Gale It is about him I came

You might have saved yourself the trouble returned Tom I dont
wish to discuss him

But I wish to make sure said Mr Gale that what he has done will
not come back on us We repudiate him entirely His methods we can not
countenance He is too daring

Oh dont worry interrupted Tom He hasnt done anything to mehe
didnt get the chance as I guess hes told you You neednt apologize
on his account He did me no harm and

But I understood from him that

Now I dont want to seem impolite broke in Tom nor do I want to
take pattern after some of your companys acts if not your own But I
am very busy I have an important test to make for the government and
my time is fully occupied I am afraid I shall have to bid you
goodmorning and

But wont you give me a chance to began the president

Now the less we discuss this matter the better interrupted Tom
Lydane as you call the man with the gold tooth didnt really do
anything to me nor any great harm to any of my possessions as far as I
can learn His career is a closed booka book with muddy covers and
the young inventor laughed

Oh well if you look at it that way there is nothing further for me
to say said Mr Gale stiffly I understood But hasnt my partner
Mr Ware seen you he asked Tom quickly

No And I dont care to see him

Oh then that accounts for it was the quick answer Well if you
regard the matter as closed I suppose we should also We are not to
blame for what Lydane does when he is no longer in our employ and we
repudiate anything he may do or may have done

This struck Tom afterward as being rather a queer remark but he did
not think so at the time

The truth was that the young inventor wished very much to try out a new
device on his noiseless aeroplane and wanted to get rid of Mr Gale
before doing so So he did not pay as much attention to the remarks of
the president as otherwise he might have done

It was not until after Mr Gale had taken his leave and Tom had
finished the particular work on which he was engaged when the president
of the rival company came in that the young man did some hard
thinking And this thinking was done after he had received a telephone
call from Mary Nestor asking if by any chance he had heard anything
like a clew as to the whereabouts of her father

Tom had been obliged to tell her that he had not Everything possible
was being done to find the missing man but he had disappeared as
completely as though he had ridden on his bicycle into the crater of
some extinct volcano on the meadow and had fallen to the bottom

An effort was made to trace him through an automobile association which
had a large membership That is the members were asked to make
inquiries to ascertain if possible whether any one had heard of an
unreported accidentone in which Mr Nestor might have been carried
away by persons who accidently ran him down

But this came to naught and the police and other authorities were at a
loss how farther to proceed It was a theory in some quarters that Mr
Nestor was perfectly safe but that he was out of his mind and was
either wandering around not knowing who he was or was in this
condition detained somewhere the persons having him in charge not
realizing that he was the missing man so widely sought

This belief was a relief to Mrs Nestor and Mary in many ways for it
prevented them from giving way to the fear that Mr Nestor was dead
That he was alive was Tom Swifts firm opinion and he was doing all he
could to prove it

It was not until the day after the visit of Mr Gale that Tom having
concluded some intricate calculations about the strength of cylinder
valves uttered an exclamation

I wonder if he could have meant that cried the young inventor I
wonder if he could have meant that I must find out at once Queer I
didnt think of that before

He put in a long distance call to New York asking to speak to Mr
Gale But when eventually he was connected with the office of the
Universal Flying Machine Company he was told that Mr Gale and Mr Ware
had sailed for France that day going over as government
representatives to investigate aeroplane motors Gales visit to Tom
had been just previous to taking the boat it was said

This is tough luck mused Tom his suspicions doubly aroused now I
cant let this rest here Ive got to get after it As soon as I make
this final test and invite Uncle Sams experts out to see how my
noiseless motor works Ill get after Gale and Ware if I have to follow
them to the battlefields of France I wonder if it was that he was
hinting at all the while I begin to believe it was

Tom Swift had decided on another flight for his new craft before he
would let the government experts see it

Silent Sam must do his very best work for Uncle Sam before I turn him
over said the young inventor

And after this flight Ill offer the machine to the government and
then devote all my time to finding Mr Nestor said Tom Id do it
now but private matters however deeply they affect us must be put
aside to help win the war But this will end my inventive work until
after Mr Nestor is foundif hes alive

Preparations for the test flight went on apace and one afternoon Tom
and Jackson took their places in the big new aeroplane He no longer
feared daylight crowds in case of an accident They made a good start
and the motor was so quiet that as Tom passed over his own plant the
men working in the yard who did not know of the flight did not look
up to see what was going on They could not hear the engine

I think weve got everything just as we want it Jackson said Tom
much pleased

I believe you answered the mechanician It couldnt be better Now
if

And at that moment there came a loud explosion and Silent Sam began
drifting rapidly toward the earth as falls a bird with a broken wing




CHAPTER XX

QUEER MARKS


What happened cried Jackson to Tom as he leaned forward in his seat
which was in the rear of the young inventors

Dont know exactly was the answer as Tom quickly shifted the
rudders to correct the slanting fall of his craft Sounded as though
there was a tremendous backfire or else the muffler blew up The
engine is dead

Can you take her down safely

Oh yes I guess so Shes a bit out of control but the stabilizer
will keep her on a level keel Good thing we installed it

Youre right said Jackson

Now they were falling earthward with great rapidity but thanks to the
gyroscope stabilizer the sideslipping than which there is no
motion more dreaded by an aviator had nearly ceased The craft was
volplaning down as it ought and Tom had it under as perfect control as
was possible under the circumstances

Well get down all right if something else doesnt happen he said to
Jackson with grim humor

Well lets hope that it wont said the mechanic Were a good
distance up yet

They were as a matter of fact for the explosion or whatever had
happened to the craft had occurred at a height of over two miles and
they at once began falling As yet Tom Swift was unaware of the exact
nature of the accident or its cause All he knew was that there had
been a big noise and that the engine had stopped working He could not
see the silencer from where he sat as it was constructed on the
underside of the motor but he had an idea that the same sort of mishap
had occurred as on the occasion when the test machine had sailed
through the roof of his workshop

But luckily this wasnt as bad mused Tom Anyhow the motor is out
of business

And this was very evident The young inventor had tried to start the
apparatus after its stoppage by the explosion but it had not responded
to his efforts and then he had desisted fearing to cause some further
damage or perhaps endanger his own life and that of Jackson

Down down swept Silent Samdoubly silent now and Tom began looking
about for a good place to make a landing This was nothing new for
either him or his mechanician and they accepted the outcome as a
matter of course

Not a very lively place down there remarked Jackson as he looked
over the side of the cockpit

If we have to depend for help on any one down there I guess well be
a long time waiting agreed Tom They were about to land in a very
lonely spot It was one he had never before visited though he knew it
could not be much more than twenty miles from his own home as they had
not flown much farther than that distance

But somehow or other Tom had not visited this particular section and
knew nothing of it He saw below him as Jackson had seen a lonely
stretch of countrya big field once a woodlot evidently as
scattered about were some stumps and some second growth trees There
were also a number of evergreensChristmas trees Jackson called them
And this was the only open place for miles the surrounding country
being a densely wooded one There did not appear to be a house or other
building in sight where they might seek help

But maybe we can make the repairs ourselves and keep on the lad
thought

With practiced eye he picked out a smooth grassy level spot in the
midst of scattered evergreen trees and there Tom Swift skillfully
brought his Air Scout to rest With a gentle thud the rubbertired
wheels struck the Earth rolled along a little distance and then
called to a stop

Hardly had the aeroplane ceased moving when Tom and his companion
jumped out and began eagerly to examine the machinery to see the extent
of damage

I thought so Tom exclaimed The silencer cracked under the strain
Those exhaust gases have more pressure that I believed possible I
increased the margin of safety on this muffler too But shes
cracked and I cant use the machine until I put on a new one Good
thing I didnt ask for a government inspection until after this trial
flight

Thats so agreed Jackson But cant you patch it up or go on
without a muffler so we can get back home

Im afraid not Tom answered You see I removed all the old exhaust
pipe fittings when I put on my new silencer Now if I took off my
attachment there wouldnt be anything to carry off the discharged
gases and theyd form a regular cloud about us We couldnt stand it
without gas masks such as they use in the trenches and we havent any
of those with us

Thats right agreed Jackson Well what do you want to do Have me
stay here and guard the machine while you go for help Or shall I go

I dont know why we both cant go said Tom There is no use trying
to patch up this machine here Ill have to send a truck after it and
dismantle it before I can get it home

As for either of us staying here on guard I dont quite see the need
of that This looks like the jumpingoff place to me I dont believe
theres a native within miles I didnt see any houses as we came down
and I think Silent Sam will be perfectly safe here No one can run off
with him anyhow Hed be as hard to start as an automobile with all
four wheels gone Lets leave it here and both walk back

All right agreed Jackson That suits me Might as well leave our
togs here too It will be easier walking without them and he began
taking off the furlined suit his cap and his goggles such as he and
Tom wore against the piercing cold of the upper regions

We can stuff them in the cockpit and leave them went on the
mechanician as he divested himself of his garments As he stowed them
away in his seat he gave one more look at the broken muffler As Tom
Swift said his new silencer had literally blown up a large piece
having been torn from the gas chamber

Something that Jackson saw caused him to utter an exclamation that
brought Tom Swift to his side

What is it asked the young inventor

Look was the answer See Just at the edge of that break Its
been filed to make the metal thinner there than anywhere else You
didnt do that did you

I should say not cried Tom Why to file there would mean to weaken
the whole structure

And thats exactly whats happened declared Jackson as he gave
another look Some one has filed this nearly throughleaving only a
thin metal skin and when the gas pressure became too much it blew out
Thats what happened

Tom Swift made a quick but thorough examination

Youre right Jackson he exclaimed That was filed deliberately to
cause the accident And it must have been done lately for I carefully
inspected the silencer when I put it on and it was in perfect order
Theres been spy work here Some one got into the hangar and filed that
casing Then the accumulated pressure of the gases did the rest

As sure as youre alive agreed Jackson Maybe thats what Gale did
when he called

No returned Tom shaking his head he didnt get a chance to do
anything like that I watched him all the while But perhaps this is
what he referred to when he said he and his company would repudiate any
act of that spy with the gold toothLydane so Gale said his name was
Maybe thats what Lydane did

He was capable of it agreed the mechanic but he couldnt have done
it that time you tripped him into the mud puddle This silencer wasnt
built then

No youre right assented Tom Then he must have been around since
doing some of his tricky work

I dont see how that could have been said Jackson slowly Weve
kept a very careful watch and your shop has been specially guarded

I know it has said Tom There couldnt much get past Koku but some
one seems to have done it or else how could that filing have been
done

Jackson shook his head The problem was too much for him He looked
carefully at the exploded and broken silencer and Tom too gave it a
critical eye There was no doubt but that it had been filed in several
places to weaken the structure of the metal

When did you last see that it was in perfect condition asked Jackson

Tom named a certain date

That was just before Gale called observed the mechanician He
might have known of it

I wish Id known of it at the time said Tom savagely He wouldnt
have gotten away as easily as he did Well theres no use standing
here talking about it Lets get back to civilization and well send
back one of the trucks Luckily I have another silencer I can put on
for the government test This one will never be of any more use though
I may be able to save some of the valves and baffle plates

Slowly they turned from the disabled aeroplane and started to look for
a path that would lead them out of the lonely place Tom as the first
to strike what seemed to be a cow path or perhaps what had been a road
into the wood lot in the early days

As he tramped along it followed by Jackson the young inventor
suddenly stopped as he came to a sandy place and stooping over
looked intently at some queer marks in the soil

What is it asked the mechanician

Looks like the marks of an automobile said Tom slowly And I was
just trying to remember where Id seen marks like these before




CHAPTER XXI

THE DESERTED CABIN


For several seconds the young inventor remained bending over the queer
marks in that little sandy path of the lonely field in the midst of the
silent woods Jackson watched him curiously and then Tom straightened
up exclaiming as he did so

I have it Now I know where it was I saw marks like these the night
Mr Nestor disappeared Mr Damon and I noticed the marks in the dust
on the road the time we made the forced landing the first night we
tried out the silent motor Thats it They are the same marks Im
sure of it

I wouldnt go so far as to say that said Jackson slowly He was more
deliberate than Tom Swift a fact for which the young inventor was
often glad as it saved him from impulsive mistakes

This may not be the same auto went on the mechanician Ill admit I
never saw square tire marks like those before Most of the usual ones
are circular diamondshape or oblong Some tire manufacturer must have
tried a new stunt But as for saying these marks were made by the same
machine you saw evidences of the night Mr Nestor disappeared why
thats going a little too far Tom

Yes I suppose it is admitted the young inventor But its a clew
worth following Maybe Mr Nestor has been brought to some lonely place
like this and is being held

Why would any one want to do that asked Jackson He had no enemies

Well perhaps those who ran him down and injured him are afraid to let
him go for fear he will prosecute them and ask for heavy damages
suggested Tom They may be holding him a captive until he gets well
and aim on treating him so nicely that he wont bring suit

Thats a pretty farfetched theory said the mechanician as he
carefully looked at the tracks But of course it may be true Anyhow
these tire marks are rather recent I should say and they are made by
a new tire Do you think we can follow them

Im going to try declared Tom The only trouble is we cant tell
whether it was going or comingthat is we dont know which way to go

Thats so agreed his companion And so the only thing to do is to
travel a bit both ways The path or road or whatever you call it is
plainly enough marked here though you cant always pick out the tire
marks They show only on bare ground The grass doesnt leave any
tracks that we can see though doubtless they are there

But as for thinking this car is the same one the marks of which you
saw on the lonely moor the night you heard the call for helpthats
going too far Tom Swift

Yes I realize that Of course there must be more than one car with
tires which have square protuberances But its worth taking a chance
onfollowing this clew

Oh sure agreed Jackson

The only question is then which way to go returned Tom

They settled that arbitrarily enough by going on in the direction
they had started after leaving the stranded airship They followed a
halfdefined path and were rewarded by getting occasional glimpses on
bare ground of the odd tire marks

Through a devious winding way now hidden amid a lane of trees and
again cutting across an open space the path led They saw the marks
often enough to make sure they were on the right trail and in one
place they saw several different patches of the odd marks

They went on perhaps half a mile more when they came to a lonely road
and saw where the car had turned from that into the woodlot as Tom
called the place where his craft had settled down

Look cried the young inventor to Jackson Theyve been here more
than once and have gone along the road in both directions They seem
to have used this turning into the lot as a sort of stopping place

This was plain enough from an examination of the marks in the sandy
soil of the road which was one not often used The automobile with the
queer square marks on the tires had turned into the lot coming and
going in both directions

This settles it cried Tom when he finished making an examination
Theres something farther back in this lot that weve got to see This
auto has been coming and going and we should have followed the tracks
the other way from the point where we first saw them instead of coming
this way

Except that weve learned the place of departure suggested Jackson
Evidently the woodlot is a blind alley The car goes in but it can
come out only just at this point or at least it does

Thats right agreed Tom Now the thing to do is to follow our track
back to where we started There must be some place where the car went
tosome headquarters or meeting place with some one farther back in
the lot If we can only follow the trail back as well as we did coming
we may find out something

Well lets try anyhow suggested Jackson

They had no difficulty in making their way back to the spot where they
had first seen the queer marks But from then on their task was not so
easy For sandy or bare patches of earth were not frequent and they
had to depend on these to give them direction for the road was
overgrown and not well defined

Often they would search about for some time after leaving one patch of
the marks before they found another that would justify them in keeping
on

They have headquarters or a rendezvous somewhere back in this lot
declared Tom as they hurried on I think were on the track of a
mystery

Unless it turns out that some farmer has treated himself to an auto
with new tires of square tread and is hauling wood said Jackson It
may turn out that way

Yes it may agreed Tom But taking everything into consideration
I think were on the verge of finding out something Even if we do
discover that the owner of this auto is only hauling wood he may be
able to help us to a clew as to the whereabouts of Mr Nestor

How

Well maybe he was in his machine on the moor the night the call for
help came He may even have aided to carry Mr Nestor away And if he
doesnt know a thing about itwhich of course is possiblethe man
who bought these queer tires can tell us who makes them or who deals
in them and we can find out what autoists around here have their cars
equipped with this odd tread

Yes agreed Jackson that can be done

And so they kept on scouting here and there to either side of the
halfdefined path until they were far back from the spot where they
had left the Air Scout

We dont appear to be getting any warmer as the children say
remarked Jackson as he straightened up and looked about for his back
ached from so much stooping over to look for the odd marks

We havent seen anything yet Ill admit said Tom But it wont be
dark for another hour or so and I vote that we keep on

Oh I wasnt thinking of giving up exclaimed Jackson If theres
anything hereat the end of the route as you might saywell find
it Only I hope it doesnt turn out to be just a wood pile from which
some farmer has been hauling logs

That would be a disappointment assented Tom

The day was waning and they realized that they ought not to spend too
much time on what might turn out to be a wild goose chase They were in
a lonely neighborhood and while they were not at all apprehensive of
danger they felt it would be best to get to shelter before dark

Well want to send word to Mr Swift that were all right

Yes said Tom Id like to get to a place where I can telephone to
him or Mrs Baggert Well if we dont find something pretty soon well
have to turn back I must complete work on the new motor for if Im to
offer it to Uncle Sam for air scout purposes the sooner I can do so
the better Things are getting pretty hot over in Europe and if ever
the United States needed aircraft on the western front they need them
now I want to help all I can and I also want to help Maryyou
understandMiss Nestor

I understand said Jackson simply I only hope you can help her But
Im afraidthis may turn out to be nothingfollowing these marks you
know

And yet said Tom slowly it would be strange if it was only a
coincidencethe two tire marks being the samethe night Mr Nestor
disappeared and now

And so they kept on hoping

The halfdefined path through the woodlot led them in a series of
turns and twists and it extended through a dense patch of woods
growing thickly where it was so dark that it seemed as if night had
fallen

We cant spend much more time here said Tom If we dont find
something in the next half mile well go back and take up the search
tomorrow Im going to find out whats at the end of this roadeven
if its only a wood pile

For ten minutes more the two went on making sure by occasional
glimpses at the marks that they were on the right track Then
suddenly they saw something which made them feel sure they had reached
their goal

In a clearing among the trees was a little cabina shack of logsand
from the appearance it was deserted There was not a sign of life
around




CHAPTER XXII

CLEWS AT LAST


For a moment at sight of the deserted cabin staring at Tom and his
friend as it were from its hiding place amid the trees the young
inventor and his companion did not move They just stood looking at the
place

Well said Tom at length we found it didnt we

We found something anyhow agreed Jackson Whether it amounts to
anything or not weve got to see

Come on cried Tom impulsively Im going to see whats there

There doesnt appear to be much of anything said Jackson as he
looked toward the lonely cabin with critical eyes I should say that
place hadnt been used even as a chicken coop in a long while

We can soon tell exclaimed Tom striding forward

Wait just a minute cried his companion catching him by the coat
Dont be in such a hurry

Why not asked Tom There isnt any danger is there

I dont know about that Theres no telling who may be hidden in that
cabin in spite of its deserted appearance And though there arent any
No Trespass signs up it may be that we wouldnt be welcome If there
are some tramps there which is possible they might take a notion to
shoot at us first and ask questions as to our peaceable intentions
afterwardwhen it would be too late

Nonsense exclaimed Tom There arent any tramps there and if there
were they wouldnt dare shoot Im going to see what the mystery
isif there is one

But there was no sign of life and taking this as an indication that
their advance would not be disputed Jackson followed Tom The latter
advanced until he could take in all the details of the shack It was
made of logs and once had been chinked with mud or clay Some of this
had fallen out leaving spaces between the tree trunks

It wasnt a bad little shack at one time decided Tom Maybe it was
a place where some one camped out during the summer But it hasnt been
used of late I never knew there was such a place around here and I
thought I knew this locality pretty well

I never heard of it either said Jackson Lets give a shout and
see if theres any one around They may be asleep Hello there he
called in sufficiently vigorous tones to have awakened an ordinary
sleeper

Put there was no answer and as the shadows of the night began to fall
the place took on a most lonely aspect

Lets go up and knockor go in if the doors open suggested Tom
We cant lose any more time if were to get out of here before night

Go ahead said Jackson and together they went to the cabin door

Locked exclaimed Tom as he saw a padlock attached to a chain It
appeared to be fastened through two staples driven one into the door
and the other into the jamb at right angles to one another and
overlapping

Knock suggested Jackson But when Tom had done so and there was no
answer the machinist took hold of the lock To his own surprise and
that of Tom one of the staples pulled out and the door swung open The
place had evidently been forced before and the lock had not been
opened by a key The staple had been pulled out and replaced loosely in
the holes

For a moment nothing could be made out in the dark interior of the
shack But as their eyes became used to the gloom Tom and his
companion were able to see that the shack consisted of two rooms

In the first one there was a rusty stove a table and some chairs and
it was evident from pans and skillets hanging on the wall as well as
from a small cupboard built on one side that this was the kitchen and
living room combined

Anybody here cried Tom as he stepped inside

Only a dull echo answered

The two could now see where a door gave entrance to an inner room and
this a quick glance showed was the sleeping apartment two bunks
being built on the side walls

Well somebody had it pretty comfortable here decided Tom as he
looked around Theyve been cooking and sleeping here and not so very
long ago either It wouldnt be such a bad place if it was cleaned
out

Thats right agreed Jackson Wouldnt mind camping here myself if
there was any fishing near

The river cant be far away suggested Tom And now lets see what
we can find and see if we can get a line on who has been here But
first well let in a little light

He opened a window in the sleeping room and pushed back the heavy
plank shutter that had been closed When the light entered it was seen
that both bunks bore evidence of having been lately slept in The
blankets were tossed back as if the occupants had risen and in the
outer room on the stove were signs that indicated a meal had been
served not many days gone by

Now observed Tom musingly as he wandered about the place if we
could only find out who owns this and who has been here lately

Jackson stooped over and thrusting aside an end of the blankets that
trailed on the floor from one of the bunks picked up something

What is it asked Tom

Looks like a leather pocketbook was the answer Thats what it is
the mechanic went on as he held the object to the light Its a
wallet

Let me see it exclaimed Tom quickly He took the wallet from the
hands of Jackson Then the young inventor uttered a cry A clew at
last he exclaimed A clew at last Mr Nestor has been in this
cabin

How do you know asked Jackson quickly

This is his wallet said Tom excitedly Ive often seen him have it
In fact he had it with him on Earthquake Island the time I sent the
wireless message for help I saw it several times then He kept in it
what few papers he had saved from the wreck And Ive seen it often
enough since Thats Mr Nestors wallet all right Besides if you
want any other evidencelook He opened the leather flaps and showed
Jackson on one stamped in gold letters the name of Marys father

Well what do you make of it Tom asked the mechanician as he
finished his examination of the wallet What does it mean The
pocketbook is empty and that

Might mean almost anything completed Tom But its a clew all
right Hes been here and Im pretty certain he was brought here in
the auto with the odd tiresthe one Mr Damon and I saw traces of the
night we heard the cries for help

But that doesnt help us now said Jackson The point is to find out
how lately Mr Nestor was here and what has happened to him since
There isnt anything in the wallet is there

Nothing answered Tom making a careful examination so as to be sure
Its as empty as a last years bird nest Hes been robbedthats
what has happened to Mr Nestor He was waylaid that night instead of
being run down as I thoughtwaylaid and robbed and then his body was
brought here

There you go again Tom Jumping to conclusions said Jackson with a
friendly smile and with the familiarity of an old and valued helper
Maybe hes in perfectly good health Just because you found his empty
wallet doesnt argue that your friend is in serious trouble He may
have dropped this on the road and some one picked it up Ill admit
they may have taken whatever was in it but that doesnt prove
anything The thing for us to do is to find out who knows about this
shack who owns it on whose land it is and whether any one has been
seen here lately

Theyve been here lately whether theyve been seen or not said Tom
positively There are the auto tracks It rained two days ago and the
tracks were made since Mr Nestor must have been here within two days

He may or may not said Jackson Say rather that some one was here
and left his wallet after him Now see if we can find other clews

They looked about in the fast fading light but at first could discover
nothing more than evidences that three or four persons had been living
in the shack and at some recent dateprobably within a day or two

They had had their meals there and had slept there But this seemed to
be all that could be established other than that Mr Nestors wallet
was there stripped of its contents

Tom was looking through the closet from which a frightened chipmunk
sprang as he opened the door There were the remains of some food
which accounted for the presence of the little striped animal And as
Tom poked about his hand came in contact with something wrapped in
paper on an upper shelf It was something that clinked metallicly

Whats that asked Jackson Knives or some other weapons

Neither answered Tom Its a couple of files and theyve been used
lately I can see something in the grooves yet and

Suddenly Tom ceased speaking and drew from his pocket a small but
powerful magnifying glass Through this he looked at one of the files
taking it out in front of the shack where the light was better

I thought so he cried Look here Jackson

What is it

Another clew answered Tom




CHAPTER XXIII

THE GOVERNMENT TEST


For a moment Jackson thought Tom had discovered a clew to or evidences
of some crime He had an unpleasant suspicion for an instant that
there was blood on the files and that it might prove to be the blood
of Mr Nestor

But the satisfaction that showed on Toms face did not seem to indicate
such dire possibilities as these

What is it asked Jackson unable to guess at what Tom was looking
through the powerful glass What do you see

Metal filings on the grooves of these files said the young inventor
And unless Im greatly mistaken the particles of filings are from
the case of my aircraft silencer

What cried the machinist Do you mean those are the files used in
weakening the outer case of your new machine so that it burst a little
while ago

Thats what I think answered Tom I know it sounds pretty
farfetched he went on But take a look for yourself If those
particles on the files arent exactly of the same color and texture as
the material of which the silencer case is made Ill never build
another machine

Jackson peered through the powerful glass moving out a little farther
from the shack so as to get the best light possible on the subject of
his examination It was fast getting dark but there was enough glow in
the western sky for his purpose

Am I right asked Tom

Youre right declared his helper This is exactly the same metal as
that of which your silencer case is made Its a peculiar mixture of
aluminum and vanadium steel I never knew it used in any shop but
yours and these filings are certainly of that metal It would seem
Tom that these were the files used to cut a crease in the case of your
silencer to weaken it so it would burst

My idea exactly cried Tom The spy who got into my shop in some
undiscovered manner did his work and then fled here to hide He left
his files behind Mr Nestor must have been here either before or
after No Ill not say that either Finding his wallet here doesnt
prove that he was here It might have been brought here by one of the
spies and dropped But Im sure were on the track of the men who
damaged my airship as well as those who know something of the mystery
of Mr Nestor

I agree with you said Jackson Of course theres a possibility that
the same peculiar metal you used in your silencer case may have been
used in some other machine shop and these files may have come from
there and have been employed in perfectly regular work But the
chances are

Theres only one way to make sure said Tom Lets take the files
with us and see if they fit in the grooves where the break came Well
take these back to where we left the Air Scout and he clinked the
files he held

We can just about make it before it gets black dark returned
Jackson But that wont give us any more time to look around here
and he indicated the hut

I fancy weve seen all there is to see here said Tom Mr Nestor
isnt here and whether he was or not is a question Anyhow some one
was here who had something to do with him after his disappearance Im
positive of that And Im sure some one was here who damaged my
airship Now well run down both those clews find out who owns this
place who has been using it and all we can along that line So if
youre ready lets travel

The two set out to make their way back to where they had left the
stranded airship It was fast becoming dark but they could hurry along
with more speed now as they did not have to stop to look for the marks
of the peculiar automobile tires They had noticed the path along which
they had traveled and in half the time they had spent coming they were
back where the Air Scout rested undisturbed in the meadow amid the
trees

Making sure that as far as they could tell no one had visited the
craft since they had left it Tom and Jackson compared the file marks
on what was left of the broken silencer case with the files they had
found in the hut They used a small but powerful electric lamp to aid
them in this examination as it was too dark to see otherwise and what
they saw caused the young inventor to exclaim

That settles it These were the files used

Thats right agreed his assistant Youve called the turn Tom The
next thing to do is to find who connects with the files

Yes To do that and find Mr Nestor said Tom We have plenty of
work ahead of us But lets get nearer civilization and send some word
to the folks at home Theyll be getting worried

It doesnt seem as if there was a way out of here without using an
airship remarked Jackson

But he and Tom finally reached the seldomused road which ran along the
field that contained the lonely shack and following this they
reached a farmhouse about a mile farther on Greatly to their relief
there was a telephone in the place True it was only a party line set
up by some neighboring farmers for their own private use but one of
the subscribers to whose home the private line ran had a long
distance instrument and after a talk with him this man promised Tom
to call up Mr Swift and acquaint him with the fact that his son and
Jackson were all right and would be home later

And now said Tom after thanking their temporary host a farmer
named Bloise can you tell us anything about an old cabin that stands
back there and he indicated the location of the mysterious shack

Well yes I can tell you a little about it but not very much said
Mr Bloise It was built some years ago by a rich New Yorker who
bought up a lot of land around here for a game preserve But it didnt
pan out This cabin was only the start of what he was going to call a
hunting lodge I believe it was There was to be a big building on
the same order but it never was built

Some say the fellow lost all his money in Wall Street and others say
the state wouldnt let him make a game preserve here However it was
the thing petered out and the old shack hasnt been used since

Oh yes it has exclaimed Tom We just came from there and there
are signs which show some one has been sleeping there and eating there

There has exclaimed the farmer Well I didnt know that

I did said his son a young man about Toms age I meant to speak
of it the other day I saw an automobile turn into the old road that
the men used when they built the shack I thought it was kind of queer
to see a touring car turn in there and I meant to speak of it but I
forgot Yes some one has been at the old cabin lately

Do you know who they are asked Tom eagerly We are looking for a
Mr Nestor who disappeared mysteriously about two weeks ago and I
just found his wallet there in the shack

You did exclaimed Mr Bloise Thats queer You relatives of this
Mr Nestor he asked

Not exactly Tom answered Just very close friends

Well its too bad about his being missing in that way went on the
farmer I read about it in the paper but I never suspected he was
around here

Oh were not sure that he was said Tom quickly Finding his wallet
doesnt prove that and he told the story of his own and Jacksons
appearance on the scene to the no small wonder of the farmer and his
family Tom said nothing about the finding of the files nor the
evidence he deduced from them That was another matter to be taken up
later

Who were in the auto you saw asked Tom of the farmers son Was
Mr Nestor in the car

I couldnt be sure of that There were two men in the machine and
they were both strangers to me They were talking together pretty
earnestly it seemed to me

One did not appear as if he was being taken away against his will did
he asked Tom

No I cant say that he did was the answers They looked to me and
acted like business men looking over land or something like that
They just turned in on the road that leads to the old hunting cabin as
we call it around here and didnt pay any attention to me Then I
forgot all about them

Neither of them could have been Mr Nestor decided Tom At least it
doesnt seem as if hed talk at all companionably to a man who had
treated him as we think Mr Nestor has been treated I guess that clew
isnt going to amount to much

It may insisted Jackson They may have had Mr Nestor in the car
all the whileconcealed in the back you know Weve got to find out
more about these men and their auto Tom

Well yes perhaps we have But how

Station some one at the shack or at the beginning of the private
road The men may come back

Thats sothey may Well do that cried the young inventor We
must tell the police and Mr Nestors folks what we have learned How
can we get back to Shopton in a hurry he asked the farmer

Well I can drive you to the railroad station was the answer

Thank you remarked Tom Well accept your offer And as soon as we
get back we must send some one from the shop to stand guard over the
airship he added in an aside to Jackson Those file fellows may come
back

Thats so we cant take any chances

The farmer soon had his team at the door and after they had had a
hasty but satisfying supper at the farmhouse the son drove Tom and
Jackson several miles to a railroad station where they could catch a
train for Shopton

In due season Toms home was reached He intended to stop but a minute
to assure his father that everything was all right and then get out
his speedy runabout to go to see Mary to tell her the news

But when Tom sought his father in the library he was told that there
was a visitor in the house

Tom said his father this gentleman is from Washington He wants to
arrange for a government test of your silent airship I told him I
thought you were about ready for it

A government test cried Tom Why I didnt think the government
even knew I was working on such an idea Tom was greatly surprised




CHAPTER XXIV

IN THE MOONLIGHT


With a reassuring smile the visitor from Washington looked at Tom Swift

The government officials he said know more than some people give
them credit forespecially in these war times Our intelligence bureau
and secret service has been much enlarged of late But dont be
alarmed Mr Swift went on the caller whose name was Mr Blair
Terrill Your secret is safe with the government but I think the time
is ripe to use it nowthat is if you have perfected it to a point
where we can use it

Yes answered Tom slowly the invention is practically finished and
it is a success except for a few minor matters that will not take long
to complete

Our accident this afternoon had nothing to do with the efficiency of
the silencer Tom went on It was deliberately damaged by some spy
Ill take that up later That I am interested to know how you heard of
my Air Scout as I call it

Well we have agents you know watching all the inventors who have
helped us in times past and we havent forgotten your giant cannon or
big searchlight I might say to end your curiosity and lull your
suspicions that your friend Ned Newton who has been doing such good
Liberty Bond work informed us of your progress on the silent motor

Oh so it was Ned exclaimed Tom

Yes He told us the time was about ripe for us to make you an offer
for your machine I think we can use it to great advantage in scout
work on the western front went on the agent and he soon convinced
Tom that when it came to a knowledge of airships he had some very
pertinent facts at his disposal

When can you give me a test Mr Terrill asked Tom

As soon as I can get my craft back to the shop and fit on a new outer
case That wont take long as I have some spare ones But I must help
the Nestors he went on speaking to his father I didnt mention it
over the wire he added but weve found in the cabin a clew to the
missing man I must tell Mary and her mother and help them all I can

And allow me to help too begged Mr Terrill Since this affects
you Mr Swift and since you are in a way working for Uncle Sam you
must let him help you This is the first I have heard of the missing
gentleman of whom your father just told me something but you must
allow me to help search for him I will get the United States Secret
Service at work

That will be fine cried Tom I wanted to get their aid but I
didnt see how I could as I knew they were too busy with army matters
and tracing seditious alien enemies to bother with private cases Im
sure the Secret Service men can get trace of the persons responsible
for the detention of Mr Nestor wherever he is

Theyll do their best said Mr Terrill Im a member of that body
he went on and Ill give my personal attention to the matter

Then followed a busy time Tom did not get to bed until nearly morning
For he had to arrange to send some of his men to guard the stranded
airship and then he went to see Mary and her mother taking them the
good news that the search for Mr Nestor would be prosecuted with
unprecedented vigor

If it isnt too late sadly said the missing mans wife

Oh Im sure it isnt declared Tom

In addition to sending a guard to the airship other men some of them
hastily summoned from the nearest federal agency were sent to keep
watch in the vicinity of the lonely cabin They had orders to arrest
whoever approached and a relay of the men was provided so that watch
could be kept up night and day Besides this other men from the Secret
Service began scouring the country around the locality of the cabin
seeking a trace of the two persons the farmers son had seen in the
automobile

If Mr Nestor is to be found theyll find him declared Tom Swift

Mr Damon as might be expected was very much excited and wrought up
over all these happenings

Bless my watch chain Tom Swift cried the eccentric man but
something is always happening to you And to think I wasnt along when
this latest happened

Well you can be in at the finish promised Tom and it was strange
how his promise was fulfilled

Meanwhile there was much to do During the time the Secret Service men
were busy looking up clews which might lead to the finding of Mr
Nestor and keeping watch in the vicinity of the hut Tom had his
airship brought back to the hangar and a new silencer was attached
While this work was going on the place was guarded night and day by
responsible men so there was no chance for an enemy spy to get in and
do further damage

An investigation was made of the Universal Flying Machine Company but
nothing could be proved to link them with the outrage Gale and Ware
were in Europeostensibly on government business but it was said that
if anything could be proved connecting them with the attempt made on
Tom Swifts craft they would be deprived of all official contracts and
punished

All this took time and the waits were wearisome particularly in the
case of Mr Nestor No further trace of him was found though every
effort was made Tom began to feel that his boast of his enemies having
to get up early in the morning to get ahead of him had been premature
to say the least

Tom Swift worked hard on his new Air Scout He determined there would
be nothing lacking when it came to the government test and not only
did he make sure that no enemy could tamper with his machine but he
took pains to see that no inherent defect would mar the test

Jackson and the other men helped to the best of their ability and Mr
Swift suggested some improvements which were incorporated in the new
machine

One of the puzzles the Secret Service men had to solve was that of the
connection if any between the men who had to do with the missing Mr
Nestor and those who had damaged Toms airship by filing the muffler
case so it was weakened and burst That there was some connection Tom
was certain but he could not work it out nor so far had the
government men

At last the day came when the big government test was to be made Tom
had completed his Air Scout and had refined it to a point where even
his critical judgment was satisfied All that remained now was to give
Mr Terrill a chance to see how silently the big craft could fly and
to this end a flight was arranged

Tom had put the silencer on a larger machine than the one he and
Jackson had used It held three easily and on a pinch four could be
carried Toms plan was to take Mr Damon and Mr Terrill fly with
them for some time in the air and demonstrate how quiet his new craft
was Then by contrast a machine without the muffler and the new motor
with its improved propellers would be flown making as much noise as
the usual craft did

I only wish said Tom as the time arrived for the official
government test that Mary could be here to see it She was the one
who really started me on this idea so to speak as it was because I
couldnt talk to her that I decided to get up a silent motor

But Mary Nestor was too griefstricken over her missing father to come
to the test which was to take place late one afternoon starting from
the aerodrome of the Swift plant

First said Tom to Mr Terrill Ill show you how the machine works
on the ground Ill run the motor while the plane is held down by means
of ropes and blocks Then well go up in it

That suits me said the agent If it does all you say it will do
and as much as I believe it will do Uncle Sam will be your debtor Mr
Swift

Well well see said Tom with a smile

Preparations were made with the greatest care and Tom went over every
detail of the machine twice to make certain that in spite of the
precautions no spy had done any hidden damage that might be
manifested at an inopportune moment But everything seemed all right
and finally the motor was started while Mr Terrill and some of his
colleagues from the Army Aviation department looked on

Contact cried Tom as Jackson indicated that the compression had
been made

The mechanic nodded gave the big propeller blades a quarter turn and
jumped back In an instant the motor was operating and the craft would
have leaped forward and cleaved the air but for the holding ropes and
blocks Tom speeded the machinery up to almost the last notch but
those in the aerodrome hardly heard a sound It was as though some
great silent dynamo were working

Fine

Wonderful

Wouldnt have believed it possible

These were some of the comments of the government inspectors

And now for the final testthat in the air said Mr Terrill

Previous to this he and his colleagues had made a minute examination of
the machinery and had been shown the interior construction of the
silencer by means of one built so that a sectional view could be had
Toms principles were pronounced fundamental and simple

So simple in fact that it is a wonder no one thought of it before
said a navy aviation expert It is the last word in aircraft
constructiona silent motor that will not apprise the enemy of its
approach You have done wonders Mr Swift

Id rather hear you say that after the air test replied Tom with a
laugh Are you ready Mr Terrill

Whenever you are

How about you Mr Damon

Oh Im always ready to go with you Tom Swift Bless my trench
helmet but you cant sail any too soon for me

There was a genial laugh at his impetuosity and the three took their
seats in the big craft Once more the engine was started It operated
as silently as before and the first good impressions were confirmed
Even as the machine moved along the ground just previous to taking
flight into the air there was no noise save the slight crunch made by
the wheels This of course would be obviated when Silent Sam was
aloft

Up and up soared the great craft with Tom at the engine and guide
controls while Mr Terrill and Mr Damon sat behind him both eagerly
watching Mr Terrill was there to find fault if he could but he was
glad he did not have to

The machine works perfectly Mr Swift he said My report cannot be
otherwise than favorable

We mustnt be in too much of a hurry said Tom who had learned
caution some time ago I want to sail around for several hours
Sometimes a machine will work well at first but defects will develop
when it is overheated Im going to do my best to make a noise with
this new motor

But it seemed impossible The machinery worked perfectly and though
Silent Sam took his passengers high and low in big circles and small
ones there was no appreciable noise from the motor The passengers
could converse as easily and with as little effort as in a balloon

Of course that isnt the prime requisite said Mr Terrill but it
is a good one What we want is a machine that can sail over the enemys
lines at night without being heard and I think this one will do itin
fact Im sure it will Of course the ability of the passengers to
converse and not have to use the uncertain tube is a great advantage

As Tom Swift sailed on and on it became evident that the test was
going to be a success The afternoon passed and it began to grow dark
but a glorious full moon came up

Shall I take you down the young inventor asked Mr Terrill

Not quite yet I thoroughly enjoy this and it isnt often I get a
chance for a moonlight airship ride Go a little lower if you please
and well see if we attract any attention from the inhabitants of the
earth Well see if they can possibly hear the machine though I dont
see how they can

And they did not Tom piloted the machine over Shopton sailing
directly over the center of the town where there was a big crowd
walking about Though the airship sailed only a few hundred feet above
their heads not a person was aware of it since the crafts lights
were put out for this test

That settles it said Mr Terrill You have succeeded Tom Swift

But Tom was not yet satisfied He wanted a longer test Hardly knowing
why he did it he sent the craft in the direction of Mary Nestors home
As he sailed across her lawn he saw in the moonlight that she and her
mother were walking in the garden They did not look up as the
aircraft passed over their heads and were totally unaware of its
presence unless they caught a glimpse of it as it flitted silently
along like some great bird of the night

It is perfectly wonderful declared Mr Terrill and he spoke in
ordinary tones that carried perfectly to the ears of Tom and Mr Damon

Wonderful cried the eccentric man Bless my chimney but its the
greatest invention in the world Yes it is Dont tell me it isnt

And no one did

Passing the Nestor home the saddened occupants of which were unaware
of the passage Tom sent the Air Scout about in a circle intending to
proceed to the hangar And then some whim perhaps caused him to
guide Silent Sam out toward the lonely hut Mr Damon and Mr Tenrill
seemed perfectly content to sail on and on indefinitely in the
moonlight Tom thought he would take them over a lonely neighborhood
and then bring them back

In a little while the craft was directly over the stretch of country
where the aeroplane accident had occurred and where Tom and Jackson
had found the deserted hut

Rather idly Tom looked down wondering if the Secret Service men were
on the watch and if they had discovered anything

Suddenly Tom was aware of an automobile moving along the field path
toward the cabin There were two men in the car both on the front
seat and as Tom looked down the brilliant moonlight showed him the
figure of another man behind and huddled in the tonneau of the car
The aeroplane was low enough for all these details to be seen by the
moons gleam but the men in the car not hearing any noise did not
look up so they were unconscious of this aerial espionage

Look Look exclaimed Tom in a low voice to his companions Doesnt
that seem suspicious




CHAPTER XXV

THE GOLD TOOTH


Eagerly Mr Damon and the government agent leaned over and looked down
In the moonlight they saw the same sight that had attracted Tom Swift
The touring car the two men in front and the huddled bound figure in
the back

Can you go down Tom without letting them hear you asked Mr Damon
using a low voice as if fearful the men in the automobile would hear
him

I guess so answered the young inventor I can land nearer to the
cabin than Jackson and I did and then we can see what these fellows
are up to It looks suspicious to me That is unless theyre some of
the Secret Service men and have made a capture he added to Mr
Terrill

Those arent any of Uncle Sams men declared the agent That is
unless the bound one is I cant see him very well Better go down
and well see if we can surprise them

My plan voiced Tom

Quickly he shifted the rudder and then shutting off the motor as he
wanted to volplane down he headed his craft for an open spot that
showed in the bright moonlight By this time the automobile and its
occupants were out of sight behind a clump of trees but Tom and his
companions felt sure of the destination of the menthe deserted cabin
in the wood

As silently as a wisp of grass falling the big craft came down on a
level spot and then leaping out the young inventor and his two
companions crept along the path toward the cabin Mr Terrill was
armed Tom carried a flashlight while Mr Damon picked up a heavy club

As soon as he came near a place where he thought the marks of the
automobile wheels would show Tom flashed his light

I thought so he exclaimed as he saw the square knobby tread marks
left by the tires Its the same gang or some of them in the same
car If we can only capture them

The Secret Service men ought to do that returned Mr Terrill but
as it developed later they were not on hand though through no fault
of theirs

On and on crept Tom and the two men until they came within sight of
the cabin They saw a light gleaming in it and Tom whispered

Now we have them Work our way up quietly and make them surrender if
we find theyre what we think

Is there a rear door asked Mr Terrill in a whisper

Tom answered in the negative and then all three in fan shape crept
up to the front portal It was open and silently reaching a place
where they could make an observation Tom and his companions looked in

What they saw filled them with wild and righteous rage and brought to
an end the mystery of the disappearance of Mr Nestor For there he
sat bound in a chair and at a table in front of him were two
forbiddinglooking men

What do you intend to do now asked Mr Nestor in a faint voice I
cannot stand this captivity much longer You admit that you dont want
methat you never wanted meso why do you keep me a prisoner It
cannot do the least good

Theres no use going over that again exclaimed the harsh voice of
one of the men We told you that if you will promise to keep still
about what happened to you and not to give the police any information
about us well let you go gladly We dont want you It was all a
mistake capturing you You were the wrong man But were not going to
let you go and have you set the police on us as soon as you get a
chance Give us your promise to say nothing and well let you join
your friends If you dont

Make no promises Mr Nestor cried Tom Swift in a ringing voice as
he leaped from his hiding place followed by his companions Your
friends are here and you can tell them everything

Up with em called Mr Terrill to the two conspirators as he
confronted them with his automatic pistol ready for firing He had no
need to mention handsthey knew what he meant and took the
characteristic attitude

Tom Tom Swift cried Mr Nestor struggling ineffectually at his
bonds Is it really you

Well I hope it isnt any imitation was the grim answer Well
tell you all about it later Jove but Im glad we found you If it
hadnt been for Silent Sam we might never have been able to

Well I dont know who Silent Sam is said Mr Nestor faintly But
Im sure Im much obliged to him and your other friends It has been
very hard Tell me are my wife and Mary all right

In good health yes but of course worrying said Tom We saw them
in the garden a little while ago Now dont talk until I set you free

And as Tom cut the ropes from Mr Nestor Mr Damon used them to bind
the two conspirators while Mr Terrill stood guard over them And when
they were safely bound and Mr Nestor had somewhat recovered from the
shock Tom had a chance to examine the prisoners

What does it all mean Who are you fellows anyhow and whats your
game he demanded

Guess itsince youre so smart snapped one

And no sooner had he opened his mouth and Tom had a glance of something
gleaming brightly yellow than the young inventor cried

The gold tooth So its you again is it you spy

The man shrugged his shoulders with an assumption of indifference And
as Tom took a closer look he became aware that the man was surely none
other than Lydane the spy he had chased into the mud puddle some weeks
before His companion was a stranger to Tom

What does it all mean Mr Nestor asked Tom Have these men held
you a prisoner ever since you called for help on the moor that night

Yes Tom they have And I did call for help after they attacked me as
I was riding my wheel but I didnt know any one heard me I began to
be afraid no one would ever help me

Weve been trying to a long time said Mr Damon but we couldnt
find you Where did they keep you

Here part of the time was Mr Nestors answer And in other lonely
houses They bound and gagged me when they took me from place to place

But what was their object asked Tom concluding it was useless to
question the two captives Why did they make you a prisoner Mr
Nestor

Because they took me for you Tom

For me

Yes The night I called at your house and found you were not at home
I put back in my pocket a bundle of papers I had brought over to show
you They were plans of a little kitchen appliance a friend of mine had
invented and I wanted to ask your opinion of it

These scoundrels must have followed me or have seen the bundle of
papers and mistaking me for you they followed attacked me in a
lonely spot and bundling me and my wrecked wheel into an auto carried
me off They first demanded that I gave up the plans and when I
wouldnt they choked off my cries for help and knocked me into
unconsciousness Then they brought me here and kept me here for
several days

They soon learned that the plans I had werent those they wanted
though what they were then after I couldnt imagine Only from what I
later overheard I knew they mistook me for you and that they were
bitterly disappointed in not getting plans of some new airship you were
working on They have kept me a prisoner ever since and though they
offered to let me go if I would keep silent I refused I did not
think to secure my own comfort I should let such men go unpunished if
I could bring about their arrest

I should say not cried Tom

Did they treat you brutally Mr Nestor asked Mr Damon

Not after they found out who I was by looking through my wallet Of
course they didnt behave very decently but they werent actually
cruel except that they bound and gagged me Oh but Im glad you came
Tom How did it happen

Then they told Mr Nestor their story and how the test of the new Air
Scout had led to his rescue

But where are the Secret Service men asked Mr Terrill when it
became evident that none them was on guard at the cabin

Later it developed that by following a false clew the Secret Service
men had been drawn miles away from the cabin And only that Tom and his
companions in the silent airship saw the men Mr Nestor might not
have been rescued for some further time

His version of what had happened was correct He had been mistaken for
Tom and the spy with the gold tooth and his accomplice had waylaid
Marys father under the belief that it was Tom Swift with the plans of
the new silent motor Mr Nestor had been attacked while riding his
wheel in a lonely place and had been carried off and kept in hiding a
prisoner even after his identity became known

Well this is a good nights work exclaimed Tom when the two rogues
had been sent to jail and Mr Nestor taken to the Bloise farmhouse to
be refreshed before he went home Word of his rescue was telephoned to
Mary and her mother and it can be imagined how they regarded Tom Swift
for his part in the affair

Little the worse for his experience save that he was very nervous Mr
Nestor was taken home He gave the details of his being waylaid and
told how the men for many days were at their wits ends to keep him
concealed when they found what a stir his disappearance had created
The conspirators were well supplied with money and in the automobile
they took their prisoner from one place to another They had usurped
the use of the cabin and had lived there nearly a week in hiding
leaving just before the first visit of Tom and Jackson The rifled
wallet had been dropped by accident

And it did not take much delving to disclose the fact that Lydane
Gold Tooth as he was called and his crony were spies in the pay of
the Universal Flying Machine Company As the men went under several
aliases there is no need of giving their names It is to be doubted if
they ever used their real onesor if they had any

Of course there was quite a sensation when Mr Nestor was found and a
greater one when it became known the part the Universal Flying Machine
people had in his disappearance in mistake for Tom The officials of
the company were indicted and several of the minor ones sent to jail
but Gale and Ware escaped by remaining abroad

It came out that they both knew of the acts of Lydane and his companion
in crime and that the two officials realized the mistake that had been
made by their clumsy operatives It was believed that this knowledge
led to the visit of Gale to Tom the time the latters suspicions were
first aroused Gale made a clumsy attempt to clear his own skirts of
the conspiracy but in vain though he did escape his just punishment

What had happened in brief was this Gale and Ware unable to secure
Toms services even by the offer of a large sum of money had stooped
to the sending of spies to his shop to get possession of information
about his silent motor This was after Gale had by accident heard Tom
speaking of it to Mr Damon

But thanks to Toms vigilance Bower was discovered The man tripped
into the mud hole lost in the muck the plans Bower passed to him They
were never recovered Then Lydane tried again He managed through
bribery to gain access to the hangar where the new silent machine was
kept and unable to get the silencer apart tried to file it In doing
so he weakened it so that it burst

The attempt to waylay Tom and so get the plans from him had been
tried before this only a mistake had been made and Mr Nestor was
caught instead Finding out their error Lydane and his companions did
not tell the Universal people of their mistake though Gale and Ware
knew the attempt was to be made against Tom Swift

Later hearing that the young inventor was still at work on his
invention Gale was much surprised and paid his queer visit in an
attempt to repudiate the actions of Lydane At this time it was assumed
that Gale and his partner did not know that it was Mr Nestor who had
been kidnapped by mistake or they might have insisted on his release
As it was Lydane had Marys father and was afraid to let him go
though really their prisoner became a white elephant on the hands of
the conspirators and kidnappers

And it was after all this was cleared up and Mr Nestor restored to
his family and friends that one day Tom Swift received another visit
from Mr Terrill the government agent

Well Mr Swift was the genial greeting I have come to tell you
that the favorable report made by my friends and myself as to the
performance of your noiseless motor has been accepted by the War
Department and I have come to ask what your terms are For how much
will you sell your patent to the United States

Tom Swift arose

The United States hasnt money enough to buy my patent of a noiseless
motor he said

Whawhat faltered Mr Terrill Why I understoodyou dont
meanthey told me you were rather patriotic and

I hope I am patriotic interrupted Tom with a smile And when I say
that the United States hasnt money enough to buy my latest invention I
mean just that

My Air Scout is not for sale

You mean faltered the government agent You say

I mean went on Tom that Silent Sam is for Uncle Sam without one
cent of cost My father and I take great pleasure in presenting such
machines as are already manufactured those in process of making and
the entire patents and all other rights to the government for the
winning of the war

Oh said Mr Terrill in rather a strange voice Oh

And that was all he could say for a little while

But Tom Swift reckoned without a knowledge of a peculiar law which
prohibits the United States from accepting gifts totally without
compensation and so in due season the young inventor received a
check for the sum of one dollar in full payment for his silent motor
and the patent rights thereto And Tom has that check framed and
hanging over his desk

And so the silent motor became an accomplished fact and a great
success Those of you who have read of its work against the Boches and
how it helped Uncle Sam to gain the mastery of the sky need not be
reminded of this By it many surprise attacks were made and much
valuable information was obtained that otherwise could not have been
brought in

One day after the rogues had been sent to prison for long terms and
Tom had turned over to his government his silent aircraftexcept one
which he was induced to keep for his own personal usethe young
inventor went to call on Mary Nestor The object of his call as I
believe he stated it was to see how Mr Nestor was but that of
course was camouflage

Would you like to come for a ride Mary in the silent airship asked
Tom after he had paid his respects to Mr Nestor and his wife We can
talk very easily on board Silent Sam without the use of a speaking
tube Come onwell go for a moonlight sky ride

It sounds enticing said Mary with a shy look at Tom But wouldnt
you just as soon sit on a bench in the garden Its moonlight there
and we can talk andand

Id just as soon said Tom quickly

And out they went into the beautiful moonlight and here we will leave
them and say goodbye
