THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED


By one who unknown to them has no other method of expressing his
admiration and reverence for their characters

That type of English virtue at once manful and godly practical and
enthusiastic prudent and selfsacrificing which he has tried to depict
in these pages they have exhibited in a form even purer and more
heroic than that in which he has drest it and than that in which it was
exhibited by the worthies whom Elizabeth without distinction of rank or
age gathered round her in the ever glorious wars of her great reign

CHAPTER I


HOW MR OXENHAM SAW THE WHITE BIRD

 The hollow oak our palace is
 Our heritage the sea

All who have travelled through the delicious scenery of North Devon must
needs know the little white town of Bideford which slopes upwards from
its broad tideriver paved with yellow sands and manyarched old bridge
where salmon wait for autumn floods toward the pleasant upland on the
west Above the town the hills close in cushioned with deep oak woods
through which juts here and there a crag of fernfringed slate below
they lower and open more and more in softly rounded knolls and fertile
squares of red and green till they sink into the wide expanse of hazy
flats rich saltmarshes and rolling sandhills where Torridge joins
her sister Taw and both together flow quietly toward the broad surges
of the bar and the everlasting thunder of the long Atlantic swell
Pleasantly the old town stands there beneath its soft Italian sky
fanned day and night by the fresh ocean breeze which forbids alike the
keen winter frosts and the fierce thunder heats of the midland and
pleasantly it has stood there for now perhaps eight hundred years
since the first Grenville cousin of the Conqueror returning from the
conquest of South Wales drew round him trusty Saxon serfs and free
Norse rovers with their golden curls and dark Silurian Britons from
the Swansea shore and all the mingled blood which still gives to the
seaward folk of the next county their strength and intellect and even
in these levelling days their peculiar beauty of face and form

But at the time whereof I write Bideford was not merely a pleasant
country town whose quay was haunted by a few coasting craft It was
one of the chief ports of England it furnished seven ships to fight the
Armada even more than a century afterwards say the chroniclers it
sent more vessels to the northern trade than any port in England saving
strange juxtaposition London and Topsham and was the centre of a
local civilization and enterprise small perhaps compared with the
vast efforts of the present day but who dare despise the day of small
things if it has proved to be the dawn of mighty ones And it is to the
sealife and labor of Bideford and Dartmouth and Topsham and Plymouth
then a petty place and many another little western town that England
owes the foundation of her naval and commercial glory It was the men
of Devon the Drakes and Hawkins Gilberts and Raleighs Grenvilles and
Oxenhams and a host more of forgotten worthies whom we shall learn
one day to honor as they deserve to whom she owes her commerce her
colonies her very existence For had they not first crippled by their
West Indian raids the illgotten resources of the Spaniard and then
crushed his last huge effort in Britains Salamis the glorious fight of
1588 what had we been by now but a popish appanage of a worldtyranny
as cruel as heathen Rome itself and far more devilish

It is in memory of these men their voyages and their battles their
faith and their valor their heroic lives and no less heroic deaths
that I write this book and if now and then I shall seem to warm into
a style somewhat too stilted and pompous let me be excused for my
subjects sake fit rather to have been sung than said and to have
proclaimed to all true English hearts not as a novel but as an epic
which some man may yet gird himself to write the same great message
which the songs of Troy and the Persian wars and the trophies of
Marathon and Salamis spoke to the hearts of all true Greeks of old


One bright summers afternoon in the year of grace 1575 a tall and
fair boy came lingering along Bideford quay in his scholars gown
with satchel and slate in hand watching wistfully the shipping and the
sailors till just after he had passed the bottom of the High Street
he came opposite to one of the many taverns which looked out upon the
river In the open bay window sat merchants and gentlemen discoursing
over their afternoons draught of sack and outside the door was
gathered a group of sailors listening earnestly to some one who stood
in the midst The boy all alive for any seanews must needs go up
to them and take his place among the sailorlads who were peeping and
whispering under the elbows of the men and so came in for the following
speech delivered in a loud bold voice with a strong Devonshire accent
and a fair sprinkling of oaths

If you dont believe me go and see or stay here and grow all over
blue mould I tell you as I am a gentleman I saw it with these eyes
and so did Salvation Yeo there through a window in the lower room and
we measured the heap as I am a christened man seventy foot long ten
foot broad and twelve foot high of silver bars and each bar between
a thirty and forty pound weight And says Captain Drake There my lads
of Devon Ive brought you to the mouth of the worlds treasurehouse
and its your own fault now if you dont sweep it out as empty as a
stockfish

Why didnt you bring some of they home then Mr Oxenham

Why werent you there to help to carry them We would have brought
em away safe enough and young Drake and I had broke the door abroad
already but Captain Drake goes off in a dead faint and when we came
to look he had a wound in his leg you might have laid three fingers in
and his boots were full of blood and had been for an hour or more but
the heart of him was that that he never knew it till he dropped
and then his brother and I got him away to the boats he kicking and
struggling and bidding us let him go on with the fight though every
step he took in the sand was in a pool of blood and so we got off And
tell me ye sons of shotten herrings wasnt it worth more to save him
than the dirty silver for silver we can get again brave boys theres
more fish in the sea than ever came out of it and more silver in Nombre
de Dios than would pave all the streets in the west country but of such
captains as Franky Drake Heaven never makes but one at a time and if
we lose him goodbye to Englands luck say I and who dont agree let
him choose his weapons and Im his man

He who delivered this harangue was a tall and sturdy personage with a
florid blackbearded face and bold restless dark eyes who leaned with
crossed legs and arms akimbo against the wall of the house and seemed
in the eyes of the schoolboy a very magnifico some prince or duke at
least He was dressed contrary to all sumptuary laws of the time in
a suit of crimson velvet a little the worse perhaps for wear by his
side were a long Spanish rapier and a brace of daggers gaudy enough
about the hilts his fingers sparkled with rings he had two or three
gold chains about his neck and large earrings in his ears behind one
of which a red rose was stuck jauntily enough among the glossy black
curls on his head was a broad velvet Spanish hat in which instead of a
feather was fastened with a great gold clasp a whole Quezal bird whose
gorgeous plumage of fretted golden green shone like one entire precious
stone As he finished his speech he took off the said hat and looking
at the bird in it

Look ye my lads did you ever see such a fowl as that before Thats
the bird which the old Indian kings of Mexico let no one wear but their
own selves and therefore I wear itI John Oxenham of South Tawton
for a sign to all brave lads of Devon that as the Spaniards are the
masters of the Indians were the masters of the Spaniards and he
replaced his hat

A murmur of applause followed but one hinted that he doubted the
Spaniards were too many for them

Too many How many men did we take Nombre de Dios with Seventythree
were we and no more when we sailed out of Plymouth Sound and before we
saw the Spanish Main half were gastados used up as the Dons say with
the scurvy and in Port Pheasant Captain Rawse of Cowes fell in with us
and that gave us some thirty hands more and with that handful my lads
only fiftythree in all we picked the lock of the new world And whom
did we lose but our trumpeter who stood braying like an ass in
the middle of the square instead of taking care of his neck like a
Christian I tell you those Spaniards are rank cowards as all bullies
are They pray to a woman the idolatrous rascals and no wonder they
fight like women

Youm right captain sang out a tall gaunt fellow who stood close to
him one westcountryman can fight two easterlings and an easterling
can beat three Dons any day Eh my lads of Devon

 For O its the herrings and the good brown beef
 And the cider and the cream so white
 O they are the making of the jolly Devon lads
 For to play and eke to fight

Come said Oxenham come along Who lists who lists wholl make his
fortune

 Oh who will join jolly mariners all
 And who will join says he O
 To fill his pockets with the good red goold
 By sailing on the sea O

Wholl list cried the gaunt man again nows your time Weve got
forty men to Plymouth now ready to sail the minute we get back and we
want a dozen out of you Bideford men and just a boy or two and then
wem off and away and make our fortunes or go to heaven

 Our bodies in the sea so deep
 Our souls in heaven to rest
 Where valiant seamen one and all
 Hereafter shall be blest

Now said Oxenham you wont let the Plymouth men say that the
Bideford men darent follow them North Devon against South it is
Wholl join wholl join It is but a step of a way after all and
sailing as smooth as a duckpond as soon as youre past Cape Finisterre
Ill run a Clovelly herringboat there and back for a wager of twenty
pound and never ship a bucketful all the way Wholl join Dont think
youre buying a pig in a poke I know the road and Salvation Yeo here
too who was the gunners mate as well as I do the narrow seas and
better You ask him to show you the chart of it now and see if he
dont tell you over the ruttier as well as Drake himself

On which the gaunt man pulled from under his arm a great white buffalo
horn covered with rough etchings of land and sea and held it up to the
admiring ring

See here boys all and behold the pictur of the place draed out
so natural as ever was life I got mun from a Portingal down to the
Azores and hed pricked mun out and pricked mun out wheresoever hed
sailed and whatsoever hed seen Take mun in your hands now Simon
Evans take mun in your hands look mun over and Ill warrant youll
know the way in five minutes so well as ever a shark in the seas

And the horn was passed from hand to hand while Oxenham who saw that
his hearers were becoming moved called through the open window for
a great tankard of sack and passed that from hand to hand after the
horn

The schoolboy who had been devouring with eyes and ears all which
passed and had contrived by this time to edge himself into the inner
ring now stood face to face with the hero of the emerald crest and got
as many peeps as he could at the wonder But when he saw the sailors
one after another having turned it over a while come forward and offer
to join Mr Oxenham his soul burned within him for a nearer view of
that wondrous horn as magical in its effects as that of Tristrem or
the enchanters in Ariosto and when the group had somewhat broken up
and Oxenham was going into the tavern with his recruits he asked boldly
for a nearer sight of the marvel which was granted at once

And now to his astonished gaze displayed themselves cities and harbors
dragons and elephants whales which fought with sharks plate ships
of Spain islands with apes and palmtrees each with its name
overwritten and here and there Here is gold and again Much gold
and silver inserted most probably as the words were in English by
the hands of Mr Oxenham himself Lingeringly and longingly the boy
turned it round and round and thought the owner of it more fortunate
than Khan or Kaiser Oh if he could but possess that horn what needed
he on earth beside to make him blest

I say will you sell this

Yea marry or my own soul if I can get the worth of it

I want the hornI dont want your soul its somewhat of a stale
sole for aught I know and there are plenty of fresh ones in the bay

And therewith after much fumbling he pulled out a tester the only one
he had and asked if that would buy it

That no nor twenty of them

The boy thought over what a good knighterrant would do in such case
and then answered Tell you what Ill fight you for it

Thank ee sir

Break the jackanapess head for him Yeo said Oxenham

Call me jackanapes again and I break yours sir And the boy lifted
his fist fiercely

Oxenham looked at him a minute smilingly Tut tut my man hit one of
your own size if you will and spare little folk like me

If I have a boys age sir I have a mans fist I shall be fifteen
years old this month and know how to answer any one who insults me

Fifteen my young cockerel you look liker twenty said Oxenham with
an admiring glance at the lads broad limbs keen blue eyes curling
golden locks and round honest face Fifteen If I had halfadozen
such lads as you I would make knights of them before I died Eh Yeo

Hell do said Yeo he will make a brave gamecock in a year or
two if he dares ruffle up so early at a tough old henmaster like the
captain

At which there was a general laugh in which Oxenham joined as loudly as
any and then bade the lad tell him why he was so keen after the horn

Because said he looking up boldly I want to go to sea I want to
see the Indies I want to fight the Spaniards Though I am a gentlemans
son Id a deal liever be a cabinboy on board your ship And the lad
having hurried out his say fiercely enough dropped his head again

And you shall cried Oxenham with a great oath and take a galloon
and dine off carbonadoed Dons Whose son are you my gallant fellow

Mr Leighs of Burrough Court

Bless his soul I know him as well as I do the Eddystone and his
kitchen too Who sups with him tonight

Sir Richard Grenville

Dick Grenville I did not know he was in town Go home and tell your
father John Oxenham will come and keep him company There off with you
Ill make all straight with the good gentleman and you shall have your
venture with me and as for the horn let him have the horn Yeo and
Ill give you a noble for it

Not a penny noble captain If young master will take a poor mariners
gift there it is for the sake of his love to the calling and
Heaven send him luck therein And the good fellow with the impulsive
generosity of a true sailor thrust the horn into the boys hands and
walked away to escape thanks

And now quoth Oxenham my merry men all make up your minds what
mannered men you be minded to be before you take your bounties I want
none of your rascally lurching longshore vermin who get five pounds
out of this captain and ten out of that and let him sail without them
after all while they are stowed away under womens mufflers and
in tavern cellars If any man is of that humor he had better to cut
himself up and salt himself down in a barrel for pork before he meets
me again for by this light let me catch him be it seven years hence
and if I do not cut his throat upon the streets its a pity But if any
man will be true brother to me true brother to him Ill be come wreck
or prize storm or calm salt water or fresh victuals or none share
and fare alike and heres my hand upon it for every man and all and
so

 Westward ho with a rumbelow
 And hurra for the Spanish Main O

After which oration Mr Oxenham swaggered into the tavern followed by
his new men and the boy took his way homewards nursing his precious
horn trembling between hope and fear and blushing with maidenly
shame and a halfsense of wrongdoing at having revealed suddenly to a
stranger the darling wish which he had hidden from his father and mother
ever since he was ten years old

Now this young gentleman Amyas Leigh though come of as good blood as
any in Devon and having lived all his life in what we should even
now call the very best society and being on account of the valor
courtesy and truly noble qualities which he showed forth in his most
eventful life chosen by me as the hero and centre of this story
was not saving for his good looks by any means what would be called
nowadays an interesting youth still less a highly educated one
for with the exception of a little Latin which had been driven into
him by repeated blows as if it had been a nail he knew no books
whatsoever save his Bible his Prayerbook the old Mort dArthur of
Caxtons edition which lay in the great bay window in the hall and the
translation of Las Casas History of the West Indies which lay beside
it lately done into English under the title of The Cruelties of the
Spaniards He devoutly believed in fairies whom he called pixies and
held that they changed babies and made the mushroom rings on the downs
to dance in When he had warts or burns he went to the white witch
at Northam to charm them away he thought that the sun moved round the
earth and that the moon had some kindred with a Cheshire cheese
He held that the swallows slept all the winter at the bottom of the
horsepond talked like Raleigh Grenville and other low persons
with a broad Devonshire accent and was in many other respects so very
ignorant a youth that any pert monitor in a national school might have
had a hearty laugh at him Nevertheless this ignorant young savage
vacant of the glorious gains of the nineteenth century childrens
literature and science made easy and worst of all of those improved
views of English history now current among our railway essayists which
consist in believing all persons male and female before the year 1688
and nearly all after it to have been either hypocrites or fools had
learnt certain things which he would hardly have been taught just now
in any school in England for his training had been that of the old
Persians to speak the truth and to draw the bow both of which savage
virtues he had acquired to perfection as well as the equally savage
ones of enduring pain cheerfully and of believing it to be the finest
thing in the world to be a gentleman by which word he had been taught
to understand the careful habit of causing needless pain to no human
being poor or rich and of taking pride in giving up his own pleasure
for the sake of those who were weaker than himself Moreover having
been entrusted for the last year with the breaking of a colt and the
care of a cast of young hawks which his father had received from Lundy
Isle he had been profiting much by the means of those coarse and
frivolous amusements in perseverance thoughtfulness and the habit
of keeping his temper and though he had never had a single object
lesson or been taught to use his intellectual powers he knew the
names and ways of every bird and fish and fly and could read as
cunningly as the oldest sailor the meaning of every drift of cloud
which crossed the heavens Lastly he had been for some time past on
account of his extraordinary size and strength undisputed cock of the
school and the most terrible fighter among all Bideford boys in which
brutal habit he took much delight and contrived strange as it may
seem to extract from it good not only for himself but for others
doing justice among his schoolfellows with a heavy hand and succoring
the oppressed and afflicted so that he was the terror of all the
sailorlads and the pride and stay of all the towns boys and girls
and hardly considered that he had done his duty in his calling if he
went home without beating a big lad for bullying a little one For the
rest he never thought about thinking or felt about feeling and had
no ambition whatsoever beyond pleasing his father and mother getting by
honest means the maximum of red quarrenders and mazard cherries
and going to sea when he was big enough Neither was he what would be
nowadays called by many a pious child for though he said his Creed
and Lords Prayer night and morning and went to the service at the
church every forenoon and read the days Psalms with his mother every
evening and had learnt from her and from his father as he proved well
in after life that it was infinitely noble to do right and infinitely
base to do wrong yet the age of childrens religious books not having
yet dawned on the world he knew nothing more of theology or of his
own soul than is contained in the Church Catechism It is a question
however on the whole whether though grossly ignorant according to
our modern notions in science and religion he was altogether untrained
in manhood virtue and godliness and whether the barbaric narrowness
of his information was not somewhat counterbalanced both in him and in
the rest of his generation by the depth and breadth and healthiness of
his education

So let us watch him up the hill as he goes hugging his horn to tell all
that has passed to his mother from whom he had never hidden anything
in his life save only that seafever and that only because he foreknew
that it would give her pain and because moreover being a prudent and
sensible lad he knew that he was not yet old enough to go and that as
he expressed it to her that afternoon there was no use hollaing till
he was out of the wood

So he goes up between the rich lanebanks heavy with drooping ferns and
honeysuckle out upon the windy down toward the old Court nestled
amid its ring of windclipt oaks through the gray gateway into the
homeclose and then he pauses a moment to look around first at the wide
bay to the westward with its southern wall of purple cliffs then at
the dim Isle of Lundy far away at sea then at the cliffs and downs of
Morte and Braunton right in front of him then at the vast yellow sheet
of rolling sandhill and green alluvial plain dotted with red cattle
at his feet through which the silver estuary winds onward toward the
sea Beneath him on his right the Torridge like a landlocked lake
sleeps broad and bright between the old park of Tapeley and the charmed
rock of the Hubbastone where seven hundred years ago the Norse rovers
landed to lay siege to Kenwith Castle a mile away on his left hand and
not three fields away are the old stones of The Bloody Corner
where the retreating Danes cut off from their ships made their last
fruitless stand against the Saxon sheriff and the valiant men of Devon
Within that charmed rock so Torridge boatmen tell sleeps now the old
Norse Viking in his leaden coffin with all his fairy treasure and his
crown of gold and as the boy looks at the spot he fancies and almost
hopes that the day may come when he shall have to do his duty against
the invader as boldly as the men of Devon did then And past him far
below upon the soft southeastern breeze the stately ships go sliding
out to sea When shall he sail in them and see the wonders of the deep
And as he stands there with beating heart and kindling eye the cool
breeze whistling through his long fair curls he is a symbol though he
knows it not of brave young England longing to wing its way out of its
island prison to discover and to traffic to colonize and to civilize
until no wind can sweep the earth which does not bear the echoes of an
English voice Patience young Amyas Thou too shalt forth and westward
ho beyond thy wildest dreams and see brave sights and do brave deeds
which no man has since the foundation of the world Thou too shalt face
invaders stronger and more cruel far than Dane or Norman and bear thy
part in that great Titan strife before the renown of which the name of
Salamis shall fade away

Mr Oxenham came that evening to supper as he had promised but as
people supped in those days in much the same manner as they do now we
may drop the thread of the story for a few hours and take it up again
after supper is over

Come now Dick Grenville do thou talk the good man round and Ill
warrant myself to talk round the good wife

The personage whom Oxenham addressed thus familiarly answered by a
somewhat sarcastic smile and Mr Oxenham gives Dick Grenville with
just enough emphasis on the Mr and the Dick to hint that a liberty
had been taken with him overmuch credit with the men Mr Oxenhams
credit with fair ladies none can doubt Friend Leigh is Heards great
ship home yet from the Straits

The speaker known well in those days as Sir Richard Grenville
Granville Greenvil Greenfield with two or three other variations was
one of those truly heroical personages whom Providence fitting always
the men to their age and their work had sent upon the earth whereof it
takes right good care not in England only but in Spain and Italy in
Germany and the Netherlands and wherever in short great men and great
deeds were needed to lift the mediaeval world into the modern

And among all the heroic faces which the painters of that age have
preserved none perhaps hardly excepting Shakespeares or Spensers
Alvas or Farinas is more heroic than that of Richard Grenville as it
stands in Princes Worthies of Devon of a Spanish type perhaps
or more truly speaking a Cornish rather than an English with just
enough of the British element in it to give delicacy to its massiveness
The forehead and whole brain are of extraordinary loftiness and
perfectly upright the nose long aquiline and delicately pointed
the mouth fringed with a short silky beard small and ripe yet firm
as granite with just pout enough of the lower lip to give hint of that
capacity of noble indignation which lay hid under its usual courtly calm
and sweetness if there be a defect in the face it is that the eyes are
somewhat small and close together and the eyebrows though delicately
arched and without a trace of peevishness too closely pressed
down upon them the complexion is dark the figure tall and graceful
altogether the likeness of a wise and gallant gentleman lovely to all
good men awful to all bad men in whose presence none dare say or do a
mean or a ribald thing whom brave men left feeling themselves nerved
to do their duty better while cowards slipped away as bats and
owls before the sun So he lived and moved whether in the Court of
Elizabeth giving his counsel among the wisest or in the streets of
Bideford capped alike by squire and merchant shopkeeper and sailor or
riding along the moorland roads between his houses of Stow and Bideford
while every woman ran out to her door to look at the great Sir Richard
the pride of North Devon or sitting there in the low mullioned window
at Burrough with his cup of malmsey before him and the lute to which
he had just been singing laid across his knees while the red western
sun streamed in upon his high bland forehead and soft curling locks
ever the same steadfast Godfearing chivalrous man conscious as far
as a soul so healthy could be conscious of the pride of beauty and
strength and valor and wisdom and a race and name which claimed
direct descent from the grandfather of the Conqueror and was tracked
down the centuries by valiant deeds and noble benefits to his native
shire himself the noblest of his race Men said that he was proud but
he could not look round him without having something to be proud of
that he was stern and harsh to his sailors but it was only when he saw
in them any taint of cowardice or falsehood that he was subject at
moments to such fearful fits of rage that he had been seen to snatch
the glasses from the table grind them to pieces in his teeth and
swallow them but that was only when his indignation had been aroused by
some tale of cruelty or oppression and above all by those West Indian
devilries of the Spaniards whom he regarded and in those days rightly
enough as the enemies of God and man Of this last fact Oxenham was
well aware and therefore felt somewhat puzzled and nettled when after
having asked Mr Leighs leave to take young Amyas with him and set
forth in glowing colors the purpose of his voyage he found Sir Richard
utterly unwilling to help him with his suit

Heyday Sir Richard You are not surely gone over to the side of those
canting fellows Spanish Jesuits in disguise every one of them they
are who pretended to turn up their noses at Franky Drake as a pirate
and be hanged to them

My friend Oxenham answered he in the sententious and measured style
of the day I have always held as you should know by this that Mr
Drakes booty as well as my good friend Captain Hawkinss is lawful
prize as being taken from the Spaniard who is not only hostis humani
generis but has no right to the same having robbed it violently by
torture and extreme iniquity from the poor Indian whom God avenge as
He surely will

Amen said Mrs Leigh

I say Amen too quoth Oxenham especially if it please Him to avenge
them by English hands

And I also went on Sir Richard for the rightful owners of the said
goods being either miserably dead or incapable by reason of their
servitude of ever recovering any share thereof the treasure falsely
called Spanish cannot be better bestowed than in building up the state
of England against them our natural enemies and thereby in building
up the weal of the Reformed Churches throughout the world and the
liberties of all nations against a tyranny more foul and rapacious than
that of Nero or Caligula which if it be not the cause of God I for
one know not what Gods cause is And as he warmed in his speech his
eyes flashed very fire

Hark now said Oxenham who can speak more boldly than he and yet he
will not help this lad to so noble an adventure

You have asked his father and mother what is their answer

Mine is this said Mr Leigh if it be Gods will that my boy should
become hereafter such a mariner as Sir Richard Grenville let him go
and God be with him but let him first bide here at home and be
trained if God give me grace to become such a gentleman as Sir Richard
Grenville

Sir Richard bowed low and Mrs Leigh catching up the last word

There Mr Oxenham you cannot gainsay that unless you will be
discourteous to his worship And for methough it be a weak womans
reason yet it is a mothers he is my only child His elder brother is
far away God only knows whether I shall see him again and what are all
reports of his virtues and his learning to me compared to that sweet
presence which I daily miss Ah Mr Oxenham my beautiful Joseph is
gone and though he be lord of Pharaohs household yet he is far away
in Egypt and you will take Benjamm also Ah Mr Oxenham you have no
child or you would not ask for mine

And how do you know that my sweet madam said the adventurer turning
first deadly pale and then glowing red Her last words had touched him
to the quick in some unexpected place and rising he courteously laid
her hand to his lips and saidI say no more Farewell sweet madam
and God send all men such wives as you

And all wives said she smiling such husbands as mine

Nay I will not say that answered he with a half sneerand then
Farewell friend Leighfarewell gallant Dick Grenville God send I
see thee Lord High Admiral when I come home And yet why should I come
home Will you pray for poor Jack gentles

Tut tut man good words said Leigh let us drink to our merry
meeting before you go And rising and putting the tankard of malmsey
to his lips he passed it to Sir Richard who rose and saying To the
fortune of a bold mariner and a gallant gentleman drank and put the
cup into Oxenhams hand

The adventurers face was flushed and his eye wild Whether from the
liquor he had drunk during the day or whether from Mrs Leighs last
speech he had not been himself for a few minutes He lifted the cup
and was in act to pledge them when he suddenly dropped it on the table
and pointed staring and trembling up and down and round the room as
if following some fluttering object

There Do you see it The birdthe bird with the white breast

Each looked at the other but Leigh who was a quickwitted man and an
old courtier forced a laugh instantly and criedNonsense brave Jack
Oxenham Leave white birds for men who will show the white feather Mrs
Leigh waits to pledge you

Oxenham recovered himself in a moment pledged them all round drinking
deep and fiercely and after hearty farewells departed never hinting
again at his strange exclamation

After he was gone and while Leigh was attending him to the door Mrs
Leigh and Grenville kept a few minutes dead silence At lastGod help
him said she

Amen said Grenville for he never needed it more But indeed
madam I put no faith in such omens

But Sir Richard that bird has been seen for generations before the
death of any of his family I know those who were at South Tawton when
his mother died and his brother also and they both saw it God help
him for after all he is a proper man

So many a lady has thought before now Mrs Leigh and well for him if
they had not But indeed I make no account of omens When God is ready
for each man then he must go and when can he go better

But said Mr Leigh who entered I have seen and especially when
I was in Italy omens and prophecies before now beget their own
fulfilment by driving men into recklessness and making them run
headlong upon that very ruin which as they fancied was running upon
them

And which said Sir Richard they might have avoided if instead of
trusting in I know not what dumb and dark destiny they had trusted in
the living God by faith in whom men may remove mountains and quench
the fire and put to flight the armies of the alien I too know and
know not how I know that I shall never die in my bed

God forfend cried Mrs Leigh

And why fair madam if I die doing my duty to my God and my queen The
thought never moves me nay to tell the truth I pray often enough that
I may be spared the miseries of imbecile old age and that end which
the old Northmen rightly called a cows death rather than a mans But
enough of this Mr Leigh you have done wisely tonight Poor Oxenham
does not go on his voyage with a single eye I have talked about him
with Drake and Hawkins and I guess why Mrs Leigh touched him so home
when she told him that he had no child

Has he one then in the West Indies cried the good lady

God knows and God grant we may not hear of shame and sorrow fallen
upon an ancient and honorable house of Devon My brother Stukely is woe
enough to North Devon for this generation

Poor braggadocio said Mr Leigh and yet not altogether that too
for he can fight at least

So can every mastiff and boar much more an Englishman And now come
hither to me my adventurous godson and dont look in such doleful
dumps I hear you have broken all the sailorboys heads already

Nearly all said young Amyas with due modesty But am I not to go
to sea

All things in their time my boy and God forbid that either I or your
worthy parents should keep you from that noble calling which is the
safeguard of this England and her queen But you do not wish to live and
die the master of a trawler

I should like to be a brave adventurer like Mr Oxenham

God grant you become a braver man than he for as I think to be bold
against the enemy is common to the brutes but the prerogative of a man
is to be bold against himself

How sir

To conquer our own fancies Amyas and our own lusts and our ambition
in the sacred name of duty this it is to be truly brave and truly
strong for he who cannot rule himself how can he rule his crew or his
fortunes Come now I will make you a promise If you will bide quietly
at home and learn from your father and mother all which befits a
gentleman and a Christian as well as a seaman the day shall come when
you shall sail with Richard Grenville himself or with better men than
he on a nobler errand than goldhunting on the Spanish Main

O my boy my boy said Mrs Leigh hear what the good Sir Richard
promises you Many an earls son would be glad to be in your place

And many an earls son will be glad to be in his place a score years
hence if he will but learn what I know you two can teach him And now
Amyas my lad I will tell you for a warning the history of that Sir
Thomas Stukely of whom I spoke just now and who was as all men know
a gallant and courtly knight of an ancient and worshipful family in
Ilfracombe well practised in the wars and well beloved at first by our
incomparable queen the friend of all true virtue as I trust she will
be of yours some day who wanted but one step to greatness and that
was this that in his hurry to rule all the world he forgot to rule
himself At first he wasted his estate in show and luxury always
intending to be famous and destroying his own fame all the while by
his vainglory and haste Then to retrieve his losses he hit upon the
peopling of Florida which thou and I will see done some day by Gods
blessing for I and some good friends of mine have an errand there as
well as he But he did not go about it as a loyal man to advance the
honor of his queen but his own honor only dreaming that he too should
be a king and was not ashamed to tell her majesty that he had rather be
sovereign of a molehill than the highest subject of an emperor

They say said Mr Leigh that he told her plainly he should be a
prince before he died and that she gave him one of her pretty quips in
return

I dont know that her majesty had the best of it A fool is many times
too strong for a wise man by virtue of his thick hide For when she
said that she hoped she should hear from him in his new principality
Yes sooth says he graciously enough And in what style asks she
To our dear sister says Stukely to which her clemency had nothing to
reply but turned away as Mr Burleigh told me laughing

Alas for him said gentle Mrs Leigh Such selfconceitand Heaven
knows we have the root of it in ourselves alsois the very daughter of
selfwill and of that loud crying out about I and me and mine which
is the very birdcall for all devils and the broad road which leads to
death

It will lead him to his said Sir Richard God grant it be not upon
Towerhill for since that Florida plot and after that his hopes of
Irish preferment came to naught he who could not help himself by fair
means has taken to foul ones and gone over to Italy to the Pope whose
infallibility has not been proof against Stukelys wit for he was soon
his Holinesss closet counsellor and they say his bosom friend and
made him give credit to his boasts that with three thousand soldiers he
would beat the English out of Ireland and make the Popes son king of
it

Ay but said Mr Leigh I suppose the Italians have the same fetch
now as they had when I was there to explain such ugly cases namely
that the Pope is infallible only in doctrine and quoad Pope while
quoad hominem he is even as others or indeed in general a deal
worse so that the office and not the man may be glorified thereby
But where is Stukely now

At Rome when last I heard of him ruffling it up and down the Vatican
as Baron Ross Viscount Murrough Earl Wexford Marquis Leinster and
a title or two more which have cost the Pope little seeing that
they never were his to give and plotting they say some harebrained
expedition against Ireland by the help of the Spanish king which must
end in nothing but his shame and ruin And now my sweet hosts I must
call for servingboy and lantern and home to my bed in Bideford

And so Amyas Leigh went back to school and Mr Oxenham went his way to
Plymouth again and sailed for the Spanish Main



CHAPTER II

HOW AMYAS CAME HOME THE FIRST TIME

 Si taceant homines facient te sidera notum
 Sol nescit comitis immemor esse sui

 Old Epigram on Drake

Five years are past and gone It is nine of the clock on a still bright
November morning but the bells of Bideford church are still ringing for
the daily service two hours after the usual time and instead of going
soberly according to wont cannot help breaking forth every five minutes
into a jocund peal and tumbling head over heels in ecstasies of joy
Bideford streets are a very flowergarden of all the colors swarming
with seamen and burghers and burghers wives and daughters all
in their holiday attire Garlands are hung across the streets and
tapestries from every window The ships in the pool are dressed in all
their flags and give tumultuous vent to their feelings by peals of
ordnance of every size Every stable is crammed with horses and
Sir Richard Grenvilles house is like a very tavern with eating
and drinking and unsaddling and running to and fro of grooms and
servingmen Along the little churchyard packed full with women
streams all the gentle blood of North Devontall and stately men and
fair ladies worthy of the days when the gentry of England were by due
right the leaders of the people by personal prowess and beauty as well
as by intellect and education And first there is my lady Countess of
Bath whom Sir Richard Grenville is escorting cap in hand for her good
Earl Bourchier is in London with the queen and there are Bassets
from beautiful Umberleigh and Carys from more beautiful Clovelly and
Fortescues of Wear and Fortescues of Buckland and Fortescues from all
quarters and Coles from Slade and Stukelys from Affton and St Legers
from Annery and Coffins from Portledge and even Coplestones from
Eggesford thirty miles away and last but not least for almost all
stop to give them place Sir John Chichester of Ralegh followed
in single file after the good old patriarchal fashion by his eight
daughters and three of his five famous sons one to avenge his
murdered brother is fighting valiantly in Ireland hereafter to rule
there wisely also as Lord Deputy and Baron of Belfast and he meets
at the gate his cousin of Arlington and behind him a train of four
daughters and nineteen sons the last of whom has not yet passed the
townhall while the first is at the Lychgate who laughing make way
for the elder though shorter branch of that most fruitful tree and so
on into the church where all are placed according to their degrees or
at least as near as may be not without a few sour looks and shovings
and whisperings from one highborn matron and another till the
churchwardens and sidesmen who never had before so goodly a company to
arrange have bustled themselves hot and red and frantic and end by
imploring abjectly the help of the great Sir Richard himself to tell
them who everybody is and which is the elder branch and which is the
younger and who carries eight quarterings in their arms and who only
four and so prevent their setting at deadly feud half the fine
ladies of North Devon for the old men are all safe packed away in the
corporation pews and the young ones care only to get a place whence
they may eye the ladies And at last there is a silence and a looking
toward the door and then distant music flutes and hautboys drums and
trumpets which come braying and screaming and thundering merrily
up to the very church doors and then cease and the churchwardens
and sidesmen bustle down to the entrance rods in hand and there is a
general whisper and rustle not without glad tears and blessings from
many a woman and from some men also as the wonder of the day enters
and the rector begins not the morning service but the good old
thanksgiving after a victory at sea

And what is it which has thus sent old Bideford wild with that goodly
joy and pious mirth of which we now only retain traditions in
our translation of the Psalms Why are all eyes fixed with greedy
admiration on those four weatherbeaten mariners decked out with knots
and ribbons by loving hands and yet more on that gigantic figure who
walks before them a beardless boy and yet with the frame and stature
of a Hercules towering like Saul of old a head and shoulders above
all the congregation with his golden locks flowing down over his
shoulders And why as the five go instinctively up to the altar and
there fall on their knees before the rails are all eyes turned to the
pew where Mrs Leigh of Burrough has hid her face between her hands
and her hood rustles and shakes to her joyful sobs Because there was
fellowfeeling of old in merry England in county and in town and
these are Devon men and men of Bideford whose names are Amyas Leigh of
Burrough John Staveley Michael Heard and Jonas Marshall of Bideford
and Thomas Braund of Clovelly and they the first of all English
mariners have sailed round the world with Francis Drake and are come
hither to give God thanks

It is a long story To explain how it happened we must go back for a
page or two almost to the point from whence we started in the last
chapter

For somewhat more than a twelvemonth after Mr Oxenhams departure
young Amyas had gone on quietly enough according to promise with the
exception of certain occasional outbursts of fierceness common to all
young male animals and especially to boys of any strength of character
His scholarship indeed progressed no better than before but his home
education went on healthily enough and he was fast becoming young as
he was a right good archer and rider and swordsman after the old
school of buckler practice when his father having gone down on
business to the Exeter Assizes caught as was too common in those days
the gaolfever from the prisoners sickened in the very court and died
within a week

And now Mrs Leigh was left to God and her own soul with this young
lioncub in leash to tame and train for this life and the life to
come She had loved her husband fervently and holily He had been often
peevish often melancholy for he was a disappointed man with an estate
impoverished by his fathers folly and his own youthful ambition which
had led him up to Court and made him waste his heart and his purse in
following a vain shadow He was one of those men moreover who possess
almost every gift except the gift of the power to use them and though
a scholar a courtier and a soldier he had found himself when he was
past forty without settled employment or aim in life by reason of
a certain shyness pride or delicate honor call it which you will
which had always kept him from playing a winning game in that very world
after whose prizes he hankered to the last and on which he revenged
himself by continual grumbling At last by his good luck he met with
a fair young Miss Foljambe of Derbyshire then about Queen Elizabeths
Court who was as tired as he of the sins of the world though she had
seen less of them and the two contrived to please each other so well
that though the queen grumbled a little as usual at the lady for
marrying and at the gentleman for adoring any one but her royal self
they got leave to vanish from the little Babylon at Whitehall and
settle in peace at Burrough In her he found a treasure and he knew
what he had found

Mrs Leigh was and had been from her youth one of those noble old
English churchwomen without superstition and without severity who
are among the fairest features of that heroic time There was a certain
melancholy about her nevertheless for the recollections of her
childhood carried her back to times when it was an awful thing to be a
Protestant She could remember among them fiveandtwenty years ago
the burning of poor blind Joan Waste at Derby and of Mistress Joyce
Lewis too like herself a lady born and sometimes even now in her
nightly dreams rang in her ears her mothers bitter cries to God
either to spare her that fiery torment or to give her strength to bear
it as she whom she loved had borne it before her For her mother who
was of a good family in Yorkshire had been one of Queen Catherines
bedchamber women and the bosom friend and disciple of Anne Askew And
she had sat in Smithfield with blood curdled by horror to see the
hapless Court beauty a month before the paragon of Henrys Court
carried in a chair so crippled was she by the rack to her fiery doom
at the stake beside her fellowcourtier Mr Lascelles while the very
heavens seemed to the shuddering mob around to speak their wrath and
grief in solemn thunder peals and heavy drops which hissed upon the
crackling pile

Therefore a sadness hung upon her all her life and deepened in the days
of Queen Mary when as a notorious Protestant and heretic she had had
to hide for her life among the hills and caverns of the Peak and was
only saved by the love which her husbands tenants bore her and by his
bold declaration that good Catholic as he was he would run through
the body any constable justice or priest yea bishop or cardinal who
dared to serve the queens warrant upon his wife

So she escaped but as I said a sadness hung upon her all her life
and the skirt of that dark mantle fell upon the young girl who had been
the partner of her wanderings and hidings among the lonely hills and
who after she was married gave herself utterly up to God

And yet in giving herself to God Mrs Leigh gave herself to her
husband her children and the poor of Northam Town and was none the
less welcome to the Grenvilles and Fortescues and Chichesters and
all the gentle families round who honored her husbands talents and
enjoyed his wit She accustomed herself to austerities which often
called forth the kindly rebukes of her husband and yet she did so
without one superstitious thought of appeasing the fancied wrath of God
or of giving Him pleasure base thought by any pain of hers for her
spirit had been trained in the freest and loftiest doctrines of Luthers
school and that little mystic AltDeutsch Theologie to which the
great Reformer said that he owed more than to any book save the Bible
and St Augustine was her counsellor and comforter by day and night

And now at little past forty she was left a widow lovely still
in face and figure and still more lovely from the divine calm which
brooded like the dove of peace and the Holy Spirit of God which indeed
it was over every look and word and gesture a sweetness which had
been ripened by storm as well as by sunshine which this world had
not given and could not take away No wonder that Sir Richard and Lady
Grenville loved her no wonder that her children worshipped her no
wonder that the young Amyas when the first burst of grief was over and
he knew again where he stood felt that a new life had begun for him
that his mother was no more to think and act for him only but that he
must think and act for his mother And so it was that on the very day
after his fathers funeral when schoolhours were over instead of
coming straight home he walked boldly into Sir Richard Grenvilles
house and asked to see his godfather

You must be my father now sir said he firmly

And Sir Richard looked at the boys broad strong face and swore a great
and holy oath like Glasgerions by oak and ash and thorn that
he would be a father to him and a brother to his mother for Christs
sake And Lady Grenville took the boy by the hand and walked home
with him to Burrough and there the two fair women fell on each others
necks and wept together the one for the loss which had been the
other as by a prophetic instinct for the like loss which was to come
to her also For the sweet St Leger knew well that her husbands fiery
spirit would never leave his body on a peaceful bed but that death as
he prayed almost nightly that it might would find him sword in
hand upon the field of duty and of fame And there those two vowed
everlasting sisterhood and kept their vow and after that all things
went on at Burrough as before and Amyas rode and shot and boxed and
wandered on the quay at Sir Richards side for Mrs Leigh was too
wise a woman to alter one tittle of the training which her husband had
thought best for his younger boy It was enough that her elder son had
of his own accord taken to that form of life in which she in her secret
heart would fain have moulded both her children For Frank Gods
wedding gift to that pure love of hers had won himself honor at home
and abroad first at the school at Bideford then at Exeter College
where he had become a friend of Sir Philip Sidneys and many another
young man of rank and promise and next in the summer of 1572 on his
way to the University of Heidelberg he had gone to Paris with luckily
for him letters of recommendation to Walsingham at the English
Embassy by which letters he not only fell in a second time with Philip
Sidney but saved his own life as Sidney did his in the Massacre of
St Bartholomews Day At Heidelberg he had stayed two years winning
fresh honor from all who knew him and resisting all Sidneys entreaties
to follow him into Italy For scorning to be a burden to his parents
he had become at Heidelberg tutor to two young German princes whom
after living with them at their fathers house for a year or more he at
last to his own great delight took with him down to Padua to
perfect them as he wrote home according to his insufficiency in all
princely studies Sidney was now returned to England but Frank found
friends enough without him such letters of recommendation and diplomas
did he carry from I know not how many princes magnificos and learned
doctors who had fallen in love with the learning modesty and virtue
of the fair young Englishman And ere Frank returned to Germany he had
satiated his soul with all the wonders of that wondrous land He had
talked over the art of sonneteering with Tasso the art of history
with Sarpi he had listened between awe and incredulity to the daring
theories of Galileo he had taken his pupils to Venice that their
portraits might be painted by Paul Veronese he had seen the palaces of
Palladio and the merchant princes on the Rialto and the argosies of
Ragusa and all the wonders of that meetingpoint of east and west he
had watched Tintorettos mighty hand hurling tempestuous glories oer
the scene and even by dint of private intercession in high places
had been admitted to that sacred room where with long silver beard and
undimmed eye amid a pantheon of his own creations the ancient Titian
patriarch of art still lingered upon earth and told old tales of the
Bellinis and Raffaelle and Michael Angelo and the building of St
Peters and the fire at Venice and the sack of Rome and of kings and
warriors statesmen and poets long since gone to their account and
showed the sacred brush which Francis the First had stooped to pick up
for him And license forbidden to Sidney by his friend Languet he had
been to Rome and seen much to the scandal of good Protestants at home
that right good fellow as Sidney calls him who had not yet eaten
himself to death the Pope for the time being And he had seen the
frescos of the Vatican and heard Palestrina preside as chapelmaster
over the performance of his own music beneath the dome of St Peters
and fallen half in love with those luscious strains till he was
awakened from his dream by the recollection that beneath that same dome
had gone up thanksgivings to the God of heaven for those bloodstained
streets and shrieking women and heaps of insulted corpses which he
had beheld in Paris on the night of St Bartholomew At last a few
months before his father died he had taken back his pupils to their
home in Germany from whence he was dismissed as he wrote with rich
gifts and then Mrs Leighs heart beat high at the thought that the
wanderer would return but alas within a month after his fathers
death came a long letter from Frank describing the Alps and the
valleys of the Waldenses with whose Barbes he had had much talk about
the late horrible persecutions and setting forth how at Padua he had
made the acquaintance of that illustrious scholar and light of the age
Stephanus Parmenius commonly called from his native place Budaeus
who had visited Geneva with him and heard the disputations of their
most learned doctors which both he and Budaeus disliked for their hard
judgments both of God and man as much as they admired them for their
subtlety being themselves as became Italian students Platonists of
the school of Ficinus and Picus Mirandolensis So wrote Master Frank
in a long sententious letter full of Latin quotations but the letter
never reached the eyes of him for whose delight it had been penned and
the widow had to weep over it alone and to weep more bitterly than ever
at the conclusion in which with many excuses Frank said that he had
at the special entreaty of the said Budaeus set out with him down the
Danube stream to Buda that he might before finishing his travels
make experience of that learning for which the Hungarians were famous
throughout Europe And after that though he wrote again and again to
the father whom he fancied living no letter in return reached him from
home for nearly two years till fearing some mishap he hurried back to
England to find his mother a widow and his brother Amyas gone to the
South Seas with Captain Drake of Plymouth And yet even then after
years of absence he was not allowed to remain at home For Sir Richard
to whom idleness was a thing horrible and unrighteous would have him up
and doing again before six months were over and sent him off to Court
to Lord Hunsdon

There being as delicately beautiful as his brother was huge and strong
he had speedily by Carews interest and that of Sidney and his Uncle
Leicester found entrance into some office in the queens household and
he was now basking in the full sunshine of Court favor and fair ladies
eyes and all the chivalries and euphuisms of Glorianas fairyland and
the fast friendship of that bright meteor Sidney who had returned with
honor in 1577 from the delicate mission on behalf of the German and
Belgian Protestants on which he had been sent to the Court of Vienna
under color of condoling with the new Emperor Rodolph on his fathers
death Frank found him when he himself came to Court in 1579 as lovely
and loving as ever and at the early age of twentyfive acknowledged
as one of the most remarkable men of Europe the patron of all men of
letters the counsellor of warriors and statesmen and the confidant and
advocate of William of Orange Languet Plessis du Mornay and all the
Protestant leaders on the Continent and found moreover that the son
of the poor Devon squire was as welcome as ever to the friendship of
natures and fortunes most favored yet most unspoilt minion

Poor Mrs Leigh as one who had long since learned to have no self
and to live not only for her children but in them submitted without a
murmur and only said smiling to her stern friendYou took away my
mastiffpup and now you must needs have my fair greyhound also

Would you have your fair greyhound dear lady grow up a tall and
true Cotswold dog that can pull down a stag of ten or one of those
smoothskinned poppets which the Florence ladies lead about with a ring
of bells round its neck and a flannel farthingale over its loins

Mrs Leigh submitted and was rewarded after a few months by a letter
sent through Sir Richard from none other than Gloriana herself in
which she thanked her for the loan of that most delicate and flawless
crystal the soul of her excellent son with more praises of him than I
have room to insert and finished by exalting the poor mother above the
famed Cornelia for those sons whom she called her jewels she
only showed yet kept them to herself but you madam having two as
precious I doubt not as were ever that Roman dames have beyond her
courage lent them both to your country and to your queen who therein
holds herself indebted to you for that which if God give her grace she
will repay as becomes both her and you Which epistle the sweet mother
bedewed with holy tears and laid by in the cedarbox which held her
household gods by the side of Franks innumerable diplomas and letters
of recommendation the Latin whereof she was always spelling over
although she understood not a word of it in hopes of finding here
and there that precious excellentissimus Noster Franciscus Leighius
Anglus which was all in all to the mothers heart

But why did Amyas go to the South Seas Amyas went to the South Seas for
two causes each of which has before now sent many a lad to far worse
places first because of an old schoolmaster secondly because of a
young beauty I will take them in order and explain

Vindex Brimblecombe whilom servitor of Exeter College Oxford commonly
called Sir Vindex after the fashion of the times was in those days
master of the grammarschool of Bideford He was at root a godly and
kindhearted pedant enough but like most schoolmasters in the old
flogging days had his heart pretty well hardened by long baneful
license to inflict pain at will on those weaker than himself a power
healthful enough for the victim for doubtless flogging is the best of
all punishments being not only the shortest but also a mere bodily and
animal and not like most of our newfangled humane punishments a
spiritual and fiendish torture but for the executioner pretty certain
to eradicate from all but the noblest spirits every trace of chivalry
and tenderness for the weak as well often as all selfcontrol and
command of temper Be that as it may old Sir Vindex had heart enough
to feel that it was now his duty to take especial care of the fatherless
boy to whom he tried to teach his qui quae quod but the only outcome
of that new sense of responsibility was a rapid increase in the number
of floggings which rose from about two a week to one per diem not
without consequences to the pedagogue himself

For all this while Amyas had never for a moment lost sight of his
darling desire for a sealife and when he could not wander on the quay
and stare at the shipping or go down to the pebbleridge at Northam
and there sit devouring with hungry eyes the great expanse of ocean
which seemed to woo him outward into boundless space he used to console
himself in schoolhours by drawing ships and imaginary charts upon his
slate instead of minding his humanities

Now it befell upon an afternoon that he was very busy at a map or
birdseye view of an island whereon was a great castle and at the
gate thereof a dragon terrible to see while in the foreground came
that which was meant for a gallant ship with a great flag aloft but
which by reason of the forest of lances with which it was crowded
looked much more like a porcupine carrying a signpost and at the
roots of those lances many little round os whereby was signified
the heads of Amyas and his schoolfellows who were about to slay that
dragon and rescue the beautiful princess who dwelt in that enchanted
tower To behold which marvel of art all the other boys at the same
desk must needs club their heads together and with the more security
because Sir Vindex as was his custom after dinner was lying back in
his chair and slept the sleep of the just

But when Amyas by special instigation of the evil spirit who haunts
successful artists proceeded further to introduce heedless of
perspective a rock on which stood the lively portraiture of Sir
Vindexnose spectacles gown and all and in his hand a brandished
rod while out of his mouth a label shrieked after the runaways
You come back while a similar label replied from the gallant bark
Goodbye master the shoving and tittering rose to such a pitch that
Cerberus awoke and demanded sternly what the noise was about To which
of course there was no answer

You of course Leigh Come up sir and show me your exercitation

Now of Amyass exercitation not a word was written and moreover
he was in the very article of putting the last touches to Mr
Brimblecombes portrait Whereon to the astonishment of all hearers he
made answer

All in good time sir and went on drawing

In good time sir Insolent veni et vapula

But Amyas went on drawing

Come hither sirrah or Ill flay you alive

Wait a bit answered Amyas

The old gentleman jumped up ferula in hand and darted across the
school and saw himself upon the fatal slate

Proh flagitium what have we here villain and clutching at his
victim he raised the cane Whereupon with a serene and cheerful
countenance up rose the mighty form of Amyas Leigh a head and
shoulders above his tormentor and that slate descended on the bald
coxcomb of Sir Vindex Brimblecombe with so shrewd a blow that slate and
pate cracked at the same instant and the poor pedagogue dropped to the
floor and lay for dead

After which Amyas arose and walked out of the school and so quietly
home and having taken counsel with himself went to his mother and
said Please mother Ive broken schoolmasters head

Broken his head thou wicked boy shrieked the poor widow what didst
do that for

I cant tell said Amyas penitently I couldnt help it It looked
so smooth and bald and round andyou know

I know Oh wicked boy thou hast given place to the devil and now
perhaps thou hast killed him

Killed the devil asked Amyas hopefully but doubtfully

No killed the schoolmaster sirrah Is he dead

I dont think hes dead his coxcomb sounded too hard for that But had
not I better go and tell Sir Richard

The poor mother could hardly help laughing in spite of her terror
at Amyass perfect coolness which was not in the least meant for
insolence and being at her wits end sent him as usual to his
godfather

Amyas rehearsed his story again with pretty nearly the same
exclamations to which he gave pretty nearly the same answers and
thenWhat was he going to do to you then sirrah

Flog me because I could not write my exercise and so drew a picture
of him instead

What art afraid of being flogged

Not a bit besides Im too much accustomed to it but I was busy and
he was in such a desperate hurry and oh sir if you had but seen his
bald head you would have broken it yourself

Now Sir Richard had twenty years ago in like place and very much
in like manner broken the head of Vindex Brimblecombes father
schoolmaster in his day and therefore had a precedent to direct him
and he answeredAmyas sirrah those who cannot obey will never be fit
to rule If thou canst not keep discipline now thou wilt never make a
company or a crew keep it when thou art grown Dost mind that sirrah

Yes said Amyas

Then go back to school this moment sir and be flogged

Very well said Amyas considering that he had got off very cheaply
while Sir Richard as soon as he was out of the room lay back in his
chair and laughed till he cried again

So Amyas went back and said that he was come to be flogged whereon the
old schoolmaster whose pate had been plastered meanwhile wept tears of
joy over the returning prodigal and then gave him such a switching as
he did not forget for eightandforty hours

But that evening Sir Richard sent for old Vindex who entered
trembling cap in hand and having primed him with a cup of sack
saidWell Mr Schoolmaster My godson has been somewhat too much for
you today There are a couple of nobles to pay the doctor

O Sir Richard gratias tibi et Domino but the boy hits shrewdly
hard Nevertheless I have repaid him in inverse kind and set him an
imposition to learn me one of Phaedrus his fables Sir Richard if you
do not think it too much

Which then The one about the man who brought up a lions cub and was
eaten by him in play at last

Ah Sir Richard you have always a merry wit But indeed the boy is a
brave boy and a quick boy Sir Richard but more forgetful than Lethe
andsapienti loquorit were well if he were away for I shall never
see him again without my head aching Moreover he put my son Jack upon
the fire last Wednesday as you would put a football though he is a
year older your worship because he said he looked so like a roasting
pig Sir Richard

Alas poor Jack

And whats more your worship he is pugnax bellicosus gladiator
a fireeater and swashbuckler beyond all Christian measure a
very sucking Entellus Sir Richard and will do to death some of her
majestys lieges erelong if he be not wisely curbed It was but a month
agone that he bemoaned himself I hear as Alexander did because there
were no more worlds to conquer saying that it was a pity he was so
strong for now he had thrashed all the Bideford lads he had no sport
left and so as my Jack tells me last Tuesday week he fell upon a
young man of Barnstaple Sir Richard a hosiers man sir and plebeius
which I consider unfit for one of his blood and moreover a man full
grown and as big as either of us Vindex stood five feet four in his
highheeled shoes and smote him clean over the quay into the mud
because he said that there was a prettier maid in Barnstaple your
worship will forgive my speaking of such toys to which my fidelity
compels me than ever Bideford could show and then offered to do the
same to any man who dare say that Mistress Rose Salterne his worship
the mayors daughter was not the fairest lass in all Devon

Eh Say that over again my good sir quoth Sir Richard who had thus
arrived as we have seen at the second count of the indictment I say
good sir whence dost thou hear all these pretty stories

My son Jack Sir Richard my son Jack ingenui vultus puer

But not it seems ingenui pudoris Tell thee what Mr Schoolmaster
no wonder if thy son gets put on the fire if thou employ him as a
talebearer But that is the way of all pedagogues and their sons
by which they train the lads up eavesdroppers and favorcurriers and
prepare themsirrah do you hearfor a much more lasting and hotter
fire than that which has scorched thy son Jacks nethertackle Do you
mark me sir

The poor pedagogue thus cunningly caught in his own trap stood
trembling before his patron who as hereditary head of the Bridge
Trust which endowed the school and the rest of the Bideford charities
could by a turn of his finger sweep him forth with the besom
of destruction and he gasped with terror as Sir Richard went
onTherefore mind you Sir Schoolmaster unless you shall promise me
never to hint word of what has passed between us two and that neither
you nor yours shall henceforth carry tales of my godson or speak his
name within a days march of Mistress Salternes look to it if I do
not

What was to be done in default was not spoken for down went poor old
Vindex on his knees

Oh Sir Richard Excellentissime immo praecelsissime Domine et
Senator I promise O sir Miles et Eques of the Garter Bath and
Golden Fleece consider your dignities and my old ageand my great
familynine childrenoh Sir Richard and eight of them girlsDo
eagles war with mice says the ancient

Thy large family eh How old is that fatwitted son of thine

Sixteen Sir Richard but that is not his fault indeed

Nay I suppose he would be still sucking his thumb if he daredget up
manget up and seat yourself

Heaven forbid murmured poor Vindex with deep humility

Why is not the rogue at Oxford with a murrain on him instead of
lurching about here carrying tales and ogling the maidens

I had hoped Sir Richardand therefore I said it was not his
faultbut there was never a servitorship at Exeter open

Go to mango to I will speak to my brethren of the Trust and to
Oxford he shall go this autumn or else to Exeter gaol for a strong
rogue and a masterless man Do you hear

Hearoh sir yes and return thanks Jack shall go Sir Richard
doubt it notI were mad else and Sir Richard may I go too

And therewith Vindex vanished and Sir Richard enjoyed a second mighty
laugh which brought in Lady Grenville who possibly had overheard the
whole for the first words she said were

I think my sweet life we had better go up to Burrough

So to Burrough they went and after much talk and many tears matters
were so concluded that Amyas Leigh found himself riding joyfully towards
Plymouth by the side of Sir Richard and being handed over to Captain
Drake vanished for three years from the good town of Bideford

And now he is returned in triumph and the observed of all observers
and looks round and round and sees all faces whom he expects except
one and that the one which he had rather see than his mothers He is
not quite sure Shame on himself

And now the prayers being ended the rector ascends the pulpit and
begins his sermon on the text

The heaven and the heaven of heavens are the Lords the whole earth
hath he given to the children of men deducing therefrom craftily to
the exceeding pleasure of his hearers the iniquity of the Spaniards
in dispossessing the Indians and in arrogating to themselves the
sovereignty of the tropic seas the vanity of the Pope of Rome in
pretending to bestow on them the new countries of America and the
justice valor and glory of Mr Drake and his expedition as testified
by Gods miraculous protection of him and his both in the Straits of
Magellan and in his battle with the Galleon and last but not least
upon the rock by Celebes when the Pelican lay for hours firmly fixed
and was floated off unhurt as it were by miracle by a sudden shift of
wind

Ay smile reader if you will and perhaps there was matter for a
smile in that honest sermon interlarded as it was with scraps of
Greek and Hebrew which no one understood but every one expected as
their right for a preacher was nothing then who could not prove himself
a good Latiner and graced moreover by a somewhat pedantic and
lengthy refutation from Scripture of Dan Horaces cockney horror of the
sea

 Illi robur et aes triplex etc

and his infidel and ungodly slander against the impias rates and their
crews

Smile if you will but those were days and there were never less
superstitious ones in which Englishmen believed in the living God and
were not ashamed to acknowledge as a matter of course His help and
providence and calling in the matters of daily life which we now
in our covert atheism term secular and carnal and when the sermon
ended the communion service had begun and the bread and the wine were
given to those five mariners every gallant gentleman who stood near
them for the press would not allow of more knelt and received the
elements with them as a thing of course and then rose to join with
heart and voice not merely in the Gloria in Excelsis but in the Te
Deum which was the closing act of all And no sooner had the clerk
given out the first verse of that great hymn than it was taken up by
five hundred voices within the church in bass and tenor treble and
alto for every one could sing in those days and the westcountry folk
as now were fuller than any of music the chant was caught up by the
crowd outside and rang away over roof and river up to the woods of
Annery and down to the marshes of the Taw in wave on wave of harmony
And as it died away the shipping in the river made answer with their
thunder and the crowd streamed out again toward the Bridge Head
whither Sir Richard Grenville and Sir John Chichester and Mr
Salterne the Mayor led the five heroes of the day to await the pageant
which had been prepared in honor of them And as they went by there
were few in the crowd who did not press forward to shake them by the
hand and not only them but their parents and kinsfolk who walked
behind till Mrs Leigh her stately joy quite broken down at last
could only answer between her sobs Go along good peopleGod a mercy
go alongand God send you all such sons

God give me back mine cried an old redcloaked dame in the crowd and
then struck by some hidden impulse she sprang forward and catching
hold of young Amyass sleeve

Kind sir dear sir For Christ his sake answer a poor old widow woman

What is it dame quoth Amyas gently enough

Did you see my son to the Indiesmy son Salvation

Salvation replied he with the air of one who recollected the name

Yes sure Salvation Yeo of Clovelly A tall man and black and
sweareth awfully in his talk the Lord forgive him

Amyas recollected now It was the name of the sailor who had given him
the wondrous horn five years ago

My good dame said he the Indies are a very large place and your
son may be safe and sound enough there without my having seen him
I knew one Salvation Yeo But he must have come withBy the by
godfather has Mr Oxenham come home

There was a dead silence for a moment among the gentlemen round and
then Sir Richard said solemnly and in a low voice turning away from
the old dame

Amyas Mr Oxenham has not come home and from the day he sailed no
word has been heard of him and all his crew

Oh Sir Richard and you kept me from sailing with him Had I known
this before I went into church I had had one mercy more to thank God
for

Thank Him all the more in thy life my child whispered his mother

And no news of him whatsoever

None but that the year after he sailed a ship belonging to Andrew
Barker of Bristol took out of a Spanish caravel somewhere off the
Honduras his two brass guns but whence they came the Spaniard knew
not having bought them at Nombre de Dios

Yes cried the old woman they brought home the guns and never
brought home my boy

They never saw your boy mother said Sir Richard

But Ive seen him I saw him in a dream four years last Whitsuntide as
plain as I see you now gentles alying upon a rock calling for a drop
of water to cool his tongue like Dives to the torment Oh dear me
and the old dame wept bitterly

There is a rose noble for you said Mrs Leigh

And there another said Sir Richard And in a few minutes four or five
gold coins were in her hand But the old dame did but look wonderingly
at the gold a moment and then

Ah dear gentles Gods blessing on you and Mr Carys mighty good to
me already but gold wont buy back childer O young gentleman young
gentleman make me a promise if you want Gods blessing on you this
day bring me back my boy if you find him sailing on the seas Bring
him back and an old widows blessing be on you

Amyas promisedwhat else could he doand the group hurried on but
the lads heart was heavy in the midst of joy with the thought of John
Oxenham as he walked through the churchyard and down the short street
which led between the ancient school and still more ancient townhouse
to the head of the long bridge across which the pageant having
arranged eastthewater was to defile and then turn to the right
along the quay

However he was bound in all courtesy to turn his attention now to the
show which had been prepared in his honor and which was really well
enough worth seeing and hearing The English were in those days an
altogether dramatic people ready and able as in Bideford that day to
extemporize a pageant a masque or any effort of the Thespian art short
of the regular drama For they were in the first place even down to
the very poorest a wellfed people with fewer luxuries than we but
more abundant necessaries and while beef ale and good woollen clothes
could be obtained in plenty without overworking either body or soul
men had time to amuse themselves in something more intellectual
than mere toping in pothouses Moreover the half century after the
Reformation in England was one not merely of new intellectual freedom
but of immense animal good spirits After years of dumb confusion and
cruel persecution a breathing time had come Mary and the fires of
Smithfield had vanished together like a hideous dream and the mighty
shout of joy which greeted Elizabeths entry into London was the
keynote of fifty glorious years the expression of a newfound strength
and freedom which vented itself at home in drama and in song abroad
in mighty conquests achieved with the laughing recklessness of boys at
play

So first preceded by the waits came along the bridge toward the
townhall a device prepared by the good rector who standing by acted
as showman and explained anxiously to the bystanders the import of
a certain allegory wherein on a great banner was depicted Queen
Elizabeth herself who in ample ruff and farthingale a Bible in one
hand and a sword in the other stood triumphant upon the necks of two
sufficiently abject personages whose triple tiara and imperial crown
proclaimed them the Pope and the King of Spain while a label issuing
from her royal mouth informed the world that

 By land and sea a virgin queen I reign
 And spurn to dust both Antichrist and Spain

Which having been received with due applause a wellbedizened lad
having in his cap as a posy Loyalty stepped forward and delivered
himself of the following verses

 Oh great Eliza oh worldfamous crew
 Which shall I hail more blest your queen or you
 While without other either falls to wrack
 And light must eyes or eyes their light must lack
 She without you a diamond sunk in mine
 Its worth unprized to self alone must shine
 You without her like hands bereft of head
 Like Ajax rage by blindfold lust misled
 She light you eyes she head and you the hands
 In fair proportion knit by heavenly hands
 Servants in queen and queen in servants blest
 Your only glory how to serve her best
 And hers how best the adventurous might to guide
 Which knows no check of foemen wind or tide
 So fair Elizas spotless fame may fly
 Triumphant round the globe and shake th astounded sky

With which sufficiently bad verses Loyalty passed on while my Lady Bath
hinted to Sir Richard not without reason that the poet in trying to
exalt both parties had very sufficiently snubbed both and intimated
that it was hardly safe for country wits to attempt that euphuistic
antithetical and delicately conceited vein whose proper fountain was
in Whitehall However on went Loyalty very well pleased with himself
and next amid much cheering two great tinsel fish a salmon and a
trout symbolical of the wealth of Torridge waddled along by means
of two human legs and a staff apiece which protruded from the fishes
stomachs They drew or seemed to draw for half the prentices in the
town were shoving it behind and cheering on the panting monarchs of
the flood a car wherein sate amid reeds and riverflags three or
four pretty girls in robes of grayblue spangled with gold their heads
wreathed one with a crown of the sweet bogmyrtle another with hops
and white convolvulus the third with pale heather and golden fern They
stopped opposite Amyas and she of the myrtle wreath rising and bowing
to him and the company began with a pretty blush to say her say

 Hither from my moorland home
 Nymph of Torridge proud I come
 Leaving fen and furzy brake
 Haunt of eft and spotted snake
 Where to fill mine urns I use
 Daily with Atlantic dews
 While beside the reedy flood
 Wild duck leads her paddling brood
 For this morn as Phoebus gay
 Chased through heaven the night mist gray
 Close beside me prankt in pride
 Sister Tamar rose and cried
 Sluggard up Tis holiday
 In the lowlands far away
 Hark how jocund Plymouth bells
 Wandering up through mazy dells
 Call me down with smiles to hail
 My daring Drakes returning sail
 Thine alone I answerd Nay
 Mine as well the joy today
 Heroes traind on Northern wave
 To that Argo new I gave
 Lent to thee they roamd the main
 Give me nymph my sons again
 Go they wait Thee Tamar cried
 Southward bounding from my side
 Glad I rose and at my call
 Came my Naiads one and all
 Nursling of the mountain sky
 Leaving Dians choir on high
 Down her cataracts laughing loud
 Ockment leapt from crag and cloud
 Leading many a nymph who dwells
 Where wild deer drink in ferny dells
 While the Oreads as they past
 Peepd from Druid Tors aghast
 By alder copses sliding slow
 Kneedeep in flowers came gentler Yeo
 And paused awhile her locks to twine
 With musky hops and white woodbine
 Then joined the silverfooted band
 Which circled down my golden sand
 By dappled park and harbor shady
 Haunt of lovelorn knight and lady
 My thricerenowned sons to greet
 With rustic song and pageant meet
 For joy the girdled robe around
 Elizas name henceforth shall sound
 Whose venturous fleets to conquest start
 Where ended once the seamans chart
 While circling Sol his steps shall count
 Henceforth from Thules western mount
 And lead new rulers round the seas
 From furthest Cassiterides
 For found is now the golden tree
 Solvd th Atlantic mystery
 Pluckd the dragonguarded fruit
 While around the charmed root
 Wailing loud the Hesperids
 Watch their warders drooping lids
 Low he lies with grisly wound
 While the sorceress triplecrownd
 In her scarlet robe doth shield him
 Till her cunning spells have heald him
 Ye meanwhile around the earth
 Bear the prize of manful worth
 Yet a nobler meed than gold
 Waits for Albions children bold
 Great Elizas virgin hand
 Welcomes you to Fairyland
 While your native Naiads bring
 Native wreaths as offering
 Simple though their show may be
 Britains worship in them see
 Tis not price nor outward fairness
 Gives the victors palm its rareness
 Simplest tokens can impart
 Noble throb to noble heart
 Graecia prize thy parsley crown
 Boast thy laurel Caesars town
 Moorland myrtle still shall be
 Badge of Devons Chivalry

And so ending she took the wreath of fragrant gale from her own head
and stooping from the car placed it on the head of Amyas Leigh who
made answer

There is no place like home my fair mistress and no scent to my taste
like this old homescent in all the spiceislands that I ever sailed
by

Her song was not so bad said Sir Richard to Lady Bathbut how came
she to hear Plymouth bells at Tamarhead full fifty miles away Thats
too much of a poets license is it not

The rivernymphs as daughters of Oceanus and thus of immortal
parentage are bound to possess organs of more than mortal keenness
but as you say the song was not so baderudite as well as
prettily conceivedand saving for a certain rustical simplicity and
monosyllabic baldness smacks rather of the forests of Castaly than
those of Torridge

So spake my Lady Bath whom Sir Richard wisely answered not for she was
a terribly learned member of the college of critics and disputed even
with Sidneys sister the chieftaincy of the Euphuists so Sir Richard
answered not but answer was made for him

Since the whole choir of Muses madam have migrated to the Court of
Whitehall no wonder if some dews of Parnassus should fertilize at times
even our Devon moors

The speaker was a tall and slim young man some fiveandtwenty years
old of so rare and delicate a beauty that it seemed that some Greek
statue or rather one of those pensive and pious knights whom the old
German artists took delight to paint had condescended to tread awhile
this workday earth in living flesh and blood The forehead was very
lofty and smooth the eyebrows thin and greatly arched the envious
gallants whispered that something at least of their curve was due to
art as was also the exceeding smoothness of those delicate cheeks
The face was somewhat long and thin the nose aquiline and the languid
mouth showed perhaps too much of the ivory upper teeth but the
most striking point of the speakers appearance was the extraordinary
brilliancy of his complexion which shamed with its whiteness that of
all fair ladies round save where open on each cheek a bright red spot
gave warning as did the long thin neck and the taper hands of sad
possibilities perhaps not far off possibilities which all saw with an
inward sigh except she whose doting glances as well as her resemblance
to the fair youth proclaimed her at once his mother Mrs Leigh
herself

Master Frank for he it was was dressed in the very extravagance of
the fashionnot so much from vanity as from that delicate instinct
of selfrespect which would keep some men spruce and spotless from one
years end to another upon a desert island for as Frank used to say
in his sententious way Mr Frank Leigh at least beholds me though
none else be by and why should I be more discourteous to him than
I permit others to be Be sure that he who is a Grobian in his own
company will sooner or later become a Grobian in that of his
friends

So Mr Frank was arrayed spotlessly but after the latest fashion of
Milan not in trunk hose and slashed sleeves nor in French standing
collar treble quadruple daedalian ruff or stiffnecked rabato that
had more arches for pride propped up with wire and timber than five
London Bridges but in a closefitting and perfectly plain suit of
dovecolor which set off cunningly the delicate proportions of his
figure and the delicate hue of his complexion which was shaded from
the sun by a broad dovecolored Spanish hat with feather to match
looped up over the right ear with a pearl brooch and therein a crowned
E supposed by the damsels of Bideford to stand for Elizabeth which
was whispered to be the gift of some most illustrious hand This same
looping up was not without good reason and purpose prepense thereby all
the world had full view of a beautiful little ear which looked as if
it had been cut of cameo and made as my Lady Rich once told him to
hearken only to the music of the spheres or to the chants of cherubim
Behind the said ear was stuck a fresh rose and the golden hair was all
drawn smoothly back and round to the left temple whence tied with a
pink ribbon in a great true lovers knot a mighty lovelock curled as
it had been laid in press rolled down low upon his bosom Oh Frank
Frank have you come out on purpose to break the hearts of all Bideford
burghers daughters And if so did you expect to further that triumph
by dyeing that pretty little pointed beard with shame I report it of
a bright vermilion But we know you better Frank and so does your
mother and you are but a masquerading angel after all in spite of
your knots and your perfumes and the gold chain round your neck which a
German princess gave you and the emerald ring on your right forefinger
which Hatton gave you and the pair of perfumed gloves in your left
which Sidneys sister gave you and the silverhilted Toledo which an
Italian marquis gave you on a certain occasion of which you never choose
to talk like a prudent and modest gentleman as you are but of which
the gossips talk of course all the more and whisper that you saved
his life from bravoesa dozen at the least and had that sword for
your reward and might have had his beautiful sisters hand beside and
I know not what else but that you had so many ladyloves already that
you were loath to burden yourself with a fresh one That at least we
know to be a lie fair Frank for your heart is as pure this day as when
you knelt in your little crib at Burrough and said

 Four corners to my bed
 Four angels round my head
 Matthew Mark Luke and John
 Bless the bed that I lie on

And who could doubt it if being pure themselves they have instinctive
sympathy with what is pure who ever looked into those great deep blue
eyes of yours the black fringed curtains of whose azure lids
usually downdropt as if in deepest thought you raise slowly almost
wonderingly each time you speak as if awakening from some fair dream
whose home is rather in your platonical eternal world of suprasensible
forms than on that workday earth wherein you nevertheless acquit
yourself so well ThereI must stop describing you or I shall catch
the infection of your own euphuism and talk of you as you would have
talked of Sidney or of Spenser or of that Swan of Avon whose song
had just begun when yoursbut I will not anticipate my Lady Bath is
waiting to give you her rejoinder

Ah my silvertongued scholar and are you then the poet or have
you been drawing on the inexhaustible bank of your friend Raleigh or my
cousin Sidney or has our new Cygnet Immerito lent you a few unpublished
leaves from some fresh Shepherds Calendar

Had either madam of that cynosural triad been within call of my
most humble importunities your ears had been delectate with far nobler
melody

But not our eyes with fairer faces eh Well you have chosen your
nymphs and had good store from whence to pick I doubt not Few
young Dulcineas round but must have been glad to take service under so
renowned a captain

The only difficulty gracious countess has been to know where to fix
the wandering choice of my bewildered eyes where all alike are fair
and all alike facund

We understand said she smiling

 Dan Cupid choosing midst his mothers graces
 Himself more fair made scorn of fairest faces

The young scholar capped her distich forthwith and bowing to her with a
meaning look


Then Goddess turn he cried and veil thy light Blinded by thine
what eyes can choose aright


Go saucy sir said my lady in high glee the pageant stays your
supreme pleasure

And away went Mr Frank as master of the revels to bring up the
prentices pageant while for his sake the nymph of Torridge was
forgotten for awhile by all young dames and most young gentlemen and
his mother heaved a deep sigh which Lady Bath overhearing

What in the dumps good madam while all are rejoicing in your joy
Are you afraid that we courtdames shall turn your Adoniss brain for
him

I do indeed fear lest your condescension should make him forget that
he is only a poor squires orphan

I will warrant him never to forget aught that he should recollect
said my Lady Bath

And she spoke truly But soon Franks silver voice was heard calling
out

Room there good people for the gallant prentice lads

And on they came headed by a giant of buckram and pasteboard armor
forth of whose stomach looked like a clockface in a steeple a human
visage to be greeted as was the fashion then by a volley of quips and
puns from high and low

Young Mr William Cary of Clovelly who was the wit of those parts
opened the fire by asking him whether he were Goliath Gogmagog or
Grantorto in the romance for giants names always began with a G To
which the giants stomach answered pretty surlily

Mine dont I begin with an O

Then thou criest out before thou art hurt O cowardly giant

Let me out lads quoth the irascible visage struggling in his
buckram prison and I soon show him whether I be a coward

Nay if thou gettest out of thyself thou wouldst be beside thyself
and so wert but a mad giant

And that were pity said Lady Bath for by the romances giants have
never overmuch wit to spare

Mercy dear lady said Frank and let the giant begin with an O

A 

A false start giant you were to begin with an O

Ill make you end with an O Mr William Cary roared the testy tower
of buckram

And so I do for I end with Fico

Be mollified sweet giant said Frank and spare the rash youth of
yon foolish knight Shall elephants catch flies or HurloThrumbo stain
his club with brains of Dagonet the jester Be mollified leave thy
caverned grumblings like Etna when its windy wrath is past and
discourse eloquence from thy central omphalos like Pythoness
ventriloquizing

If you do begin laughing at me too Mr Leigh  said the giants
clockface in a piteous tone

I laugh not Art thou not Ordulf the earl and I thy humblest squire
Speak up my lord your cousin my Lady Bath commands you

And at last the giant began

 A giant I Earl Ordulf men me call
 Gainst Paynim foes Devonias champion tall
 In single fight six thousand Turks I slew
 Pulld off a lions head and ate it too
 With one shrewd blow to let St Edward in
 I smote the gates of Exeter in twain
 Till aged grown by angels warnd in dream
 I built an abbey fair by Tavy stream
 But treacherous time hath tripped my glories up
 The stanch old hound must yield to stancher pup
 Heres one so tall as I and twice so bold
 Where I took only cuffs takes good red gold
 From pole to pole resound his wondrous works
 Who slew more Spaniards than I eer slew Turks
 I strode across the Tavy stream but he
 Strode round the world and back and here a be

Oh bathos said Lady Bath while the prentices shouted applause Is
this hedgebantling to be fathered on you Mr Frank

It is necessary by all laws of the drama madam said Frank with a
sly smile that the speech and the speaker shall fit each other Pass
on Earl Ordulf a more learned worthy waits

Whereon up came a fresh member of the procession namely no less
a person than Vindex Brimblecombe the ancient schoolmaster with
fiveandforty boys at his heels who halting pulled out his
spectacles and thus signified his forgiveness of his whilom broken
head

That the world should have been circumnavigated ladies and gentles
were matter enough of jubilation to the student of Herodotus and Plato
Plinius and  ahem much more when the circumnavigators are Britons
more again when Damnonians

Dont swear master said young Will Cary

Gulielme Cary Gulielme Cary hast thou forgotten thy

Whippings Never old lad Go on but let not the license of the
scholar overtop the modesty of the Christian

More again as I said when incolae inhabitants of Devon but
most of all men of Bideford school Oh renowned school Oh schoolboys
ennobled by fellowship with him Oh most happy pedagogue to whom it has
befallen to have chastised a circumnavigator and like another Chiron
trained another Hercules yet more than Hercules for he placed
his pillars on the ocean shore and then returned but my scholars
voyage

Hark how the old fox is praising himself all along on the sly said
Cary

Mr William Mr William peacesilentium my graceless pupil Urge
the foaming steed and strike terror into the rapid stag but meddle not
with matters too high for thee

He has given you the dor now sir said Lady Bath let the old man
say his say

I bring therefore as my small contribution to this days feast first
a Latin epigram as thus

Latin Let us hear it forthwith cried my lady

And the old pedant mouthed out

 Torriguiam Tamaris ne spernat Leighius addet
 Mox terras terris inclyte Drake tuis

Neat i faith la Whereon all the rest as in duty bound approved
also

This for the erudite for vulgar ears the vernacular is more consonant
sympathetic instructive as thus

 Famed Argo ship that noble chip by doughty Jasons steering
 Brought back to Greece the golden fleece from Colchis home
 careering
 But now her fame is put to shame while new Devonian Argo
 Round earth doth run in wake of sun and brings wealthier cargo

Runs with a right falalla observed Cary and would go nobly to a
fiddle and a big drum

 Ye Spaniards quake our doughty Drake a royal swan is tested
 On wing and oar from shore to shore the raging main who
 breasted
 But never needs to chant his deeds like swan that lies adying
 So far his name by trump of fame around the sphere is flying

Hillo ho schoolmaster shouted a voice from behind move on and
make way for Father Neptune Whereon a whole storm of raillery fell
upon the hapless pedagogue

We waited for the parsons alligator but we waint for yourn

Allegory my children allegory shrieked the man of letters

What do ye call he an alligator for He is but a poor little starved
evat

Out of the road old Custis March on Don Palmado

These allusions to the usual instrument of torture in Westcountry
schools made the old gentleman wince especially when they were followed
home by

Who stole Admiral Grenvilles brooms because birch rods were dear

But proudly he shook his bald head as a bull shakes off the flies and
returned to the charge once more


Great Alexander famed commander wept and made a pother At conquering
only half the world but Drake had conquerd tother And Hercules to
brink of seas


Oh

And clapping both hands to the back of his neck the schoolmaster began
dancing frantically about while his boys broke out tittering O the
ochidore look to the blue ochidore Whove put ochidore to maisters
poll

It was too true neatly inserted as he stooped forward between his
neck and his collar was a large live shorecrab holding on tight with
both hands

Gentles good Christians save me I am marerode Incubo vel ab
incubo opprimor Satanas has me by the poll Help he tears my jugular
he wrings my neck as he does to Dr Faustus in the play ConfiteorI
confess Satan I defy thee Good people I confess Greek text The
truth will out Mr Francis Leigh wrote the epigram And diving through
the crowd the pedagogue vanished howling while Father Neptune crowned
with seaweeds a trident in one hand and a live dogfish in the other
swaggered up the street surrounded by a tall bodyguard of mariners and
followed by a great banner on which was depicted a globe with Drakes
ship sailing thereon upside down and overwritten

 See every man the Pelican
 Which round the world did go
 While her sternpost was uppermost
 And topmasts down below
 And by the way she lost a day
 Out of her log was stole
 But Neptune kind with favoring wind
 Hath brought her safe and whole

Now lads cried Neptune hand me my parable thats writ for me and
here goeth

And at the top of his bullvoice he began roaring

 I am King Neptune bold
 The ruler of the seas
 I dont understand much singing upon land
 But I hope what I say will please

 Here be five Bideford men
 Which have saild the world around
 And I watchd them well as they all can tell
 And brought them home safe and sound

 For it is the men of Devon
 To see them I take delight
 Both to tack and to hull and to heave and to pull
 And to prove themselves in fight

 Where be those Spaniards proud
 That make their valiant boasts
 And think for to keep the poor Indians for their sheep
 And to farm my golden coasts

 Twas the devil and the Pope gave them
 My kingdom for their own
 But my nephew Francis Drake he caused them to quake
 And he pickd them to the bone

 For the sea my realm it is
 As good Queen Besss is the land
 So freely come again all merry Devon men
 And theres old Neptunes hand

Holla boys holla Blow up Triton and bring forward the freedom of
the seas

Triton roaring through a conch brought forward a cockleshell full of
saltwater and delivered it solemnly to Amyas who of course put a
noble into it and returned it after Grenville had done the same

Holla Dick Admiral cried neptune who was pretty far gone in liquor
we knew thou hadst a right English heart in thee for all thou standest
there as taut as a Don who has swallowed his rapier

Grammercy stop thy bellowing fellow and on for thou smellest vilely
of fish

Everything smells sweet in its right place Im going home

I thought thou wert there all along being already halfseas over
said Cary

Ay right UpseeDutch and thats more than thou ever wilt be thou
longshore stayathome Why wast making sheeps eyes at Mistress
Salterne here while my pretty little chuck of Burrough there was
playing at shovegroat with Spanish doubloons

Go to the devil sirrah said Cary Neptune had touched on a sore
subject and more cheeks than Amyas Leighs reddened at the hint

Amen if Heaven so please and on rolled the monarch of the seas and
so the pageant ended

The moment Amyas had an opportunity he asked his brother Frank
somewhat peevishly where Rose Salterne was

What the mayors daughter With her uncle by Kilkhampton I believe

Now cunning Master Frank whose daily wish was to seek peace and ensue
it told Amyas this because he must needs speak the truth but he was
purposed at the same time to speak as little truth as he could for fear
of accidents and therefore omitted to tell his brother how that he
two days before had entreated Rose Salterne herself to appear as the
nymph of Torridge which honor she who had no objection either to
exhibit her pretty face to recite pretty poetry or to be trained
thereto by the cynosure of North Devon would have assented willingly
but that her father stopped the pretty project by a peremptory
countermove and packed her off in spite of her tears to the said
uncle on the Atlantic cliffs after which he went up to Burrough and
laughed over the whole matter with Mrs Leigh

I am but a burgher Mrs Leigh and you a lady of blood but I am too
proud to let any man say that Simon Salterne threw his daughter at your
sons headno not if you were an empress

And to speak truth Mr Salterne there are young gallants enough in
the country quarrelling about her pretty face every day without making
her a tourneyqueen to tilt about

Which was very true for during the three years of Amyass absence Rose
Salterne had grown into so beautiful a girl of eighteen that half North
Devon was mad about the Rose of Torridge as she was called and
there was not a young gallant for ten miles round not to speak of her
fathers clerks and prentices who moped about after her like so many
Malvolios and treasured up the very parings of her nails who would
not have gone to Jerusalem to win her So that all along the vales of
Torridge and of Taw and even away to Clovelly for young Mr Cary was
one of the sick not a gay bachelor but was frowning on his fellows
and vying with them in the fashion of his clothes the set of his ruffs
the harness of his horse the carriage of his hawks the pattern of his
swordhilt and those were golden days for all tailors and armorers
from Exmoor to Okehampton town But of all those foolish young lads
not one would speak to the other either out hunting or at the archery
butts or in the tiltyard and my Lady Bath who confessed that there
was no use in bringing out her daughters where Rose Salterne was in the
way prophesied in her classical fashion that Roses wedding bid fair
to be a very bridal of Atalanta and feast of the Lapithae and poor
Mr Will Cary who always blurted out the truth when old Salterne once
asked him angrily in Bideford Market What a plague business had he
making sheeps eyes at his daughter broke out before all bystanders
And what a plague business had you old boy to throw such an apple of
discord into our merry meetings hereabouts If you choose to have such
a daughter you must take the consequences and be hanged to you To
which Mr Salterne answered with some truth That she was none of his
choosing nor of Mr Carys neither And so the dor being given the
belligerents parted laughing but the war remained in statu quo and
not a week passed but by mysterious hands some nosegay or languishing
sonnet was conveyed into The Roses chamber all which she stowed away
with the simplicity of a country girl finding it mighty pleasant and
took all compliments quietly enough probably because on the authority
of her mirror she considered them no more than her due

And now to add to the general confusion home was come young Amyas
Leigh more desperately in love with her than ever For as is the
way with sailors who after all are the truest lovers as they are the
finest fellows God bless them upon earth his lonely shipwatches
had been spent in imprinting on his imagination month after month year
after year every feature and gesture and tone of the fair lass whom he
had left behind him and that all the more intensely because beside
his mother he had no one else to think of and was as pure as the day
he was born having been trained as many a brave young man was then
to look upon profligacy not as a proof of manhood but as what the old
Germans and those Gortyneans who crowned the offender with wool knew
it to be a cowardly and effeminate sin



CHAPTER III

OF TWO GENTLEMEN OF WALES AND HOW THEY HUNTED WITH THE HOUNDS AND YET
RAN WITH THE DEER

 I know that Deformed he has been a vile thief this seven years
 he goes up and down like a gentleman I remember his nameMuch
 Ado About Nothing

Amyas slept that night a tired and yet a troubled sleep and his mother
and Frank as they bent over his pillow could see that his brain was
busy with many dreams

And no wonder for over and above all the excitement of the day the
recollection of John Oxenham had taken strange possession of his mind
and all that evening as he sat in the baywindowed room where he had
seen him last Amyas was recalling to himself every look and gesture
of the lost adventurer and wondering at himself for so doing till
he retired to sleep only to renew the fancy in his dreams At last he
found himself he knew not how sailing westward ever up the wake of
the setting sun in chase of a tiny sail which was John Oxenhams
Upon him was a painful sense that unless he came up with her in time
something fearful would come to pass but the ship would not sail All
around floated the sargasso beds clogging her bows with their long
snaky coils of weed and still he tried to sail and tried to fancy that
he was sailing till the sun went down and all was utter dark And then
the moon arose and in a moment John Oxenhams ship was close aboard
her sails were torn and fluttering the pitch was streaming from her
sides her bulwarks were rotting to decay And what was that line of
dark objects dangling along the mainyardA line of hanged men And
horror of horrors from the yardarm close above him John Oxenhams
corpse looked down with gravelight eyes and beckoned and pointed as
if to show him his way and strove to speak and could not and pointed
still not forward but back along their course And when Amyas looked
back behold behind him was the snow range of the Andes glittering in
the moon and he knew that he was in the South Seas once more and that
all America was between him and home And still the corpse kept pointing
back and back and looking at him with yearning eyes of agony and lips
which longed to tell some awful secret till he sprang up and woke with
a shout of terror and found himself lying in the little coved chamber
in dear old Burrough with the gray autumn morning already stealing in

Feverish and excited he tried in vain to sleep again and after an
hours tossing rose and dressed and started for a bathe on his beloved
old pebble ridge As he passed his mothers door he could not help
looking in The dim light of morning showed him the bed but its
pillow had not been pressed that night His mother in her long white
nightdress was kneeling at the other end of the chamber at her
priedieu absorbed in devotion Gently he slipped in without a word
and knelt down at her side She turned smiled passed her arm around
him and went on silently with her prayers Why not They were for him
and he knew it and prayed also and his prayers were for her and for
poor lost John Oxenham and all his vanished crew

At last she rose and standing above him parted the yellow locks from
off his brow and looked long and lovingly into his face There was
nothing to be spoken for there was nothing to be concealed between
these two souls as clear as glass Each knew all which the other meant
each knew that its own thoughts were known At last the mutual gaze was
over she stooped and kissed him on the brow and was in the act to
turn away as a tear dropped on his forehead Her little bare feet were
peeping out from under her dress He bent down and kissed them again and
again and then looking up as if to excuse himself

You have such pretty feet mother

Instantly with a womans instinct she had hidden them She had been a
beauty once as I said and though her hair was gray and her roses had
faded long ago she was beautiful still in all eyes which saw deeper
than the mere outward red and white

Your dear father used to say so thirty years ago

And I say so still you always were beautiful you are beautiful now

What is that to you silly boy Will you play the lover with an old
mother Go and take your walk and think of younger ladies if you can
find any worthy of you

And so the son went forth and the mother returned to her prayers

He walked down to the pebble ridge where the surges of the bay have
defeated their own fury by rolling up in the course of ages a rampart
of gray boulderstones some two miles long as cunningly curved and
smoothed and fitted as if the work had been done by human hands which
protects from the high tides of spring and autumn a fertile sheet of
smooth alluvial turf Sniffing the keen salt air like a young seadog
he stripped and plunged into the breakers and dived and rolled and
tossed about the foam with stalwart arms till he heard himself hailed
from off the shore and looking up saw standing on the top of the
rampart the tall figure of his cousin Eustace

Amyas was halfdisappointed at his coming for lovelorn rascal he had
been dreaming all the way thither of Rose Salterne and had no wish
for a companion who would prevent his dreaming of her all the way back
Nevertheless not having seen Eustace for three years it was but civil
to scramble out and dress while his cousin walked up and down upon the
turf inside

Eustace Leigh was the son of a younger brother of Leigh of Burrough who
had more or less cut himself off from his family and indeed from his
countrymen by remaining a Papist True though born a Papist he had
not always been one for like many of the gentry he had become a
Protestant under Edward the Sixth and then a Papist again under Mary
But to his honor be it said at that point he had stopped having
too much honesty to turn Protestant a second time as hundreds did at
Elizabeths accession So a Papist he remained living out of the way
of the world in a great rambling dark house still called Chapel
on the Atlantic cliffs in Moorwinstow parish not far from Sir Richard
Grenvilles house of Stow The penal laws never troubled him for in
the first place they never troubled any one who did not make conspiracy
and rebellion an integral doctrine of his religious creed and next
they seldom troubled even them unless fired with the glory of
martyrdom they bullied the longsuffering of Elizabeth and her council
into giving them their deserts and like poor Father Southwell in
after years insisted on being hanged whether Burleigh liked or not
Moreover in such a nomansland and endofalltheearth was that old
house at Moorwinstow that a dozen conspiracies might have been hatched
there without any one hearing of it and Jesuits and seminary priests
skulked in and out all the year round unquestioned though unblest and
found a sort of piquant pleasure like naughty boys who have crept
into the storecloset in living in mysterious little dens in a lonely
turret and going up through a trapdoor to celebrate mass in a secret
chamber in the roof where they were allowed by the powers that were to
play as much as they chose at persecuted saints and preach about hiding
in dens and caves of the earth For once when the zealous parson
of Moorwinstow having discovered what everybody knew already the
existence of mass priests and their idolatry at Chapel House made
formal complaint thereof to Sir Richard and called on him as the
nearest justice of the peace to put in force the act of the fourteenth
of Elizabeth that worthy knight only rated him soundly for a
fantastical Puritan and bade him mind his own business if he wished
not to make the place too hot for him whereon for the temporal
authorities happily for the peace of England kept in those days
a somewhat tight hand upon the spiritual ones the worthy parson
subsidedfor after all Mr Thomas Leigh paid his tithes regularly
enoughand was content as he expressed it to bow his head in the
house of Rimmon like Naaman of old by eating Mr Leighs dinners
as often as he was invited and ignoring the vocation of old Father
Francis who sat opposite to him dressed as a layman and calling
himself the young gentlemans pedagogue

But the said birds of illomen had a very considerable lien on the
conscience of poor Mr Thomas Leigh the father of Eustace in the form
of certain lands once belonging to the Abbey of Hartland He more than
half believed that he should be lost for holding those lands but he did
not believe it wholly and therefore he did not give them up which
was the case as poor Mary Tudor found to her sorrow with most of her
Catholic subjects whose consciences while they compelled them to
return to the only safe fold of Mother Church extra quam nulla salus
by no means compelled them to disgorge the wealth of which they had
plundered that only hope of their salvation Most of them however like
poor Tom Leigh felt the abbey rents burn in their purses and as John
Bull generally does in a difficulty compromised the matter by a second
folly as if two wrong things made one right one and petted foreign
priests and listened or pretended not to listen to their plottings
and their practisings and gave up a son here and a son there as a
sort of a sinoffering and scapegoat to be carried off to Douay or
Rheims or Rome and trained as a seminary priest in plain English to
be taught the science of villainy on the motive of superstition One of
such hapless scapegoats and children who had been cast into the fire to
Moloch was Eustace Leigh whom his father had sent giving the fruit of
his body for the sin of his soul to be made a liar of at Rheims

And a very fair liar he had become Not that the lad was a bad fellow at
heart but he had been chosen by the harpies at home on account of his
peculiar vocation in plain English because the wily priests had seen
in him certain capacities of vague hysterical fear of the unseen the
religious sentiment we call it nowadays and with them that tendency
to be a rogue which superstitious men always have He was now a tall
handsome lightcomplexioned man with a huge upright forehead a very
small mouth and a dry and set expression of face which was always
trying to get free or rather to seem free and indulge in smiles and
dimples which were proper for one ought to have Christian love and
if one had love one ought to be cheerful and when people were cheerful
they smiled and therefore he would smile and tried to do so but his
charity prepense looked no more alluring than malice prepense would have
done and had he not been really a handsome fellow many a woman who
raved about his sweetness would have likened his frankness to that of a
skeleton dancing in fetters and his smiles to the grins thereof

He had returned to England about a month before in obedience to the
proclamation which had been set forth for that purpose and certainly
not before it was needed that whosoever had children wards
etc in the parts beyond the seas should send in their names to the
ordinary and within four months call them home again So Eustace was
now staying with his father at Chapel having nevertheless his private
matters to transact on behalf of the virtuous society by whom he
had been brought up one of which private matters had brought him to
Bideford the night before

So he sat down beside Amyas on the pebbles and looked at him all over
out of the corners of his eyes very gently as if he did not wish to
hurt him or even the flies on his back and Amyas faced right round
and looked him full in the face with the heartiest of smiles and held
out a lions paw which Eustace took rapturously and a great shaking of
hands ensued Amyas gripping with a great round fist and a quiet quiver
thereof as much as to say I AM glad to see you and Eustace pinching
hard with white straight fingers and sawing the air violently up and
down as much as to say DONT YOU SEE how glad I am to see you A
very different greeting from the former

Hold hard old lad said Amyas before you break my elbow And where
do you come from

From going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in
it said he with a little smile and nod of mysterious selfimportance

Like the devil eh Well every man has his pattern How is my uncle

Now if there was one man on earth above another of whom Eustace Leigh
stood in dread it was his cousin Amyas In the first place he knew
Amyas could have killed him with a blow and there are natures who
instead of rejoicing in the strength of men of greater prowess than
themselves look at such with irritation dread at last spite
expecting perhaps that the stronger will do to them what they feel
they might have done in his place Every one perhaps has the same
envious cowardly devil haunting about his heart but the brave men
though they be very sparrows kick him out the cowards keep him and
foster him and so did poor Eustace Leigh

Next he could not help feeling that Amyas despised him They had not
met for three years but before Amyas went Eustace never could argue
with him simply because Amyas treated him as beneath argument No doubt
he was often rude and unfair enough but the whole mass of questions
concerning the unseen world which the priests had stimulated in his
cousins mind into an unhealthy fungus crop were to Amyas simply as he
expressed it wind and moonshine and he treated his cousin as a
sort of harmless lunatic and as they say in Devon halfbaked And
Eustace knew it and knew too that his cousin did him an injustice
He used to undervalue me said he to himself let us see whether he
does not find me a match for him now And then went off into an agony
of secret contrition for his selfseeking and his forgetting that
the glory of God and not his own exaltation was the object of his
existence

There dear readers Ex pede Herculem I cannot tire myself or you
especially in this book with any wiredrawn souldissections I have
tried to hint to you two opposite sorts of menthe one trying to be
good with all his might and main according to certain approved methods
and rules which he has got by heart and like a weak oarsman feeling
and fingering his spiritual muscles over all day to see if they are
growing the other not even knowing whether he is good or not but just
doing the right thing without thinking about it as simply as a little
child because the Spirit of God is with him If you cannot see the
great gulf fixed between the two I trust that you will discover it some
day

But in justice be it said all this came upon Eustace not because he
was a Romanist but because he was educated by the Jesuits Had he been
saved from them he might have lived and died as simple and honest a
gentleman as his brothers who turned out like true Englishmen as did
all the Romish laity to face the great Armada and one of whom was
fighting at that very minute under St Leger in Ireland and as brave
and loyal a soldier as those Roman Catholics whose noble blood has
stained every Crimean battlefield but his fate was appointed otherwise
and the Upasshadow which has blighted the whole Romish Church blighted
him also

Ah my dearest cousin said Eustace how disappointed I was this
morning at finding I had arrived just a day too late to witness your
triumph But I hastened to your home as soon as I could and learning
from your mother that I should find you here hurried down to bid you
welcome again to Devon

Well old lad it does look very natural to see you I often used to
think of you walking the deck o nights Uncle and the girls are all
right then But is the old pony dead yet And hows Dick the smith and
Nancy Grown a fine maid by now I warrant Slid it seems half a life
that Ive been away

And you really thought of your poor cousin Be sure that he too
thought of you and offered up nightly his weak prayers for your safety
doubtless not without avail to those saints to whom would that
you

Halt there coz If they are half as good fellows as you and I take
them for theyll help me without asking

They have helped you Amyas

Maybe Id have done as much Im sure for them if I d been in their
place

And do you not feel then that you owe a debt of gratitude to them
and above all to her whose intercessions have I doubt not availed
for your preservation Her the star of the sea the allcompassionate
guide of the mariner

Humph said Amyas Heres Frank let him answer

And as he spoke up came Frank and after due greetings sat down
beside them on the ridge

I say brother heres Eustace trying already to convert me and
telling me that I owe all my luck to the Blessed Virgins prayers for
me

It may be so said Frank at least you owe it to the prayers of that
most pure and peerless virgin by whose commands you sailed the sweet
incense of whose orisons has gone up for you daily and for whose sake
you were preserved from flood and foe that you might spread the fame
and advance the power of the spotless championess of truth and right
and freedomElizabeth your queen

Amyas answered this rhapsody which would have been then both
fashionable and sincere by a loyal chuckle Eustace smiled meekly but
answered somewhat venomously nevertheless

I at least am certain that I speak the truth when I call my
patroness a virgin undefiled

Both the brothers brows clouded at once Amyas as he lay on his back
on the pebbles said quietly to the gulls over his headI wonder what
the Frenchman whose head I cut off at the Azores thinks by now about
all that

Cut off a Frenchmans head said Frank

Yes faith and so fleshed my maiden sword Ill tell you It was
in some tavern I and George Drake had gone in and there sat this
Frenchman with his sword on the table ready for a quarrel I found
afterwards he was a noted bully and begins with us loudly enough about
this and that but after awhile by the instigation of the devil what
does he vent but a dozen slanders against her majestys honor one atop
of the other I was ashamed to hear them and I should be more ashamed
to repeat them

I have heard enough of such said Frank They come mostly through
lewd rascals about the French ambassador who have been bred God help
them among the filthy vices of that Medicean Court in which the Queen
of Scots had her schooling and can only perceive in a virtuous freedom
a cloak for licentiousness like their own Let the curs bark Honi soit
qui mal y pense is our motto and shall be forever

But I didnt let the cur bark for I took him by the ears to show him
out into the street Whereon he got to his sword and I to mine and a
very near chance I had of never bathing on the pebble ridge more for
the fellow did not fight with edge and buckler like a Christian but
had some newfangled French devils device of scryming and foining with
his point haing and stamping and tracing at me that I expected to be
full of eyelet holes ere I could close with him

Thank God that you are safe then said Frank I know that play well
enough and dangerous enough it is

Of course you know it but I didnt mores the pity

Well Ill teach it thee lad as well as Rowland Yorke himself

 Thy fincture carricade and sly passata
 Thy stramazon and resolute stoccata
 Wiping maudritta closing embrocata
 And all the cant of the honorable fencing mystery

Rowland Yorke Whos he then

A very roystering rascal who is making good profit in London just now
by teaching this very art of fence and is as likely to have his mortal
thread clipt in a tavern brawl as thy Frenchman But how did you escape
his pinking iron

How Had it through my left arm before I could look round and at that
I got mad and leapt upon him and caught him by the wrist and then had
a fair sideblow and as fortune would have it off tumbled his head on
to the table and there was an end of his slanders

So perish all her enemies said Frank and Eustace who had been
trying not to listen rose and said

I trust that you do not number me among them

As you speak I do coz said Frank But for your own sake let
me advise you to put faith in the true report of those who have daily
experience of their mistresss excellent virtue as they have of the
suns shining and of the earths bringing forth fruit and not in the
tattle of a few cowardly backstair rogues who wish to curry favor with
the Guises Come we will say no more Walk round with us by Appledore
and then home to breakfast

But Eustace declined having immediate business he said in Northam
town and then in Bideford and so left them to lounge for another
halfhour on the beach and then walk across the smooth sheet of turf to
the little white fishing village which stands some two miles above the
bar at the meeting of the Torridge and the Taw

Now it came to pass that Eustace Leigh as we have seen told his
cousins that he was going to Northam but he did not tell them that
his point was really the same as their own namely Appledore and
therefore after having satisfied his conscience by going as far as the
very nearest house in Northam village he struck away sharp to the left
across the fields repeating I know not what to the Blessed Virgin all
the way whereby he went several miles out of his road and also as
is the wont of crooked spirits Jesuits especially as three centuries
sufficiently testify only outwitted himself For his cousins going
merrily like honest men along the straight road across the turf
arrived in Appledore opposite the little Mariners Rest Inn just in
time to see what Eustace had taken so much trouble to hide from them
namely four of Mr Thomas Leighs horses standing at the door held by
his groom saddles and mailbags on back and mounting three of them
Eustace Leigh and two strange gentlemen

Theres one lie already this morning growled Amyas he told us he
was going to Northam

And we do not know that he has not been there blandly suggested
Frank

Why you are as bad a Jesuit as he to help him out with such a fetch

He may have changed his mind

Bless your pure imagination my sweet boy said Amyas laying his
great hand on Franks head and mimicking his mothers manner I
say dear Frank lets step into this shop and buy a pennyworth of
whipcord

What do you want with whipcord man

To spin my top to be sure

Top how long hast had a top

Ill buy one then and save my conscience but the upshot of this
sport I must see Why may not I have an excuse ready made as well as
Master Eustace

So saying he pulled Frank into the little shop unobserved by the party
at the inndoor

What strange cattle has he been importing now Look at that
threelegged fellow trying to get aloft on the wrong side How he claws
at his horses ribs like a cat scratching an elder stem

The threelegged man was a tall meeklooking person who had bedizened
himself with gorgeous garments a great feather and a sword so long
and broad that it differed little in size from the very thin and stiff
shanks between which it wandered uncomfortably

Young David in Sauls weapons said Frank He had better not go in
them for he certainly has not proved them

Look if his third leg is not turned into a tail Why does not some one
in charity haul in halfayard of his belt for him

It was too true the sword after being kicked out three or four times
from its uncomfortable post between his legs had returned unconquered
and the hilt getting a little too far back by reason of the too great
length of the belt the weapon took up its post triumphantly behind
standing out point in air a tail confest amid the tittering of the
ostlers and the cheers of the sailors

At last the poor man by dint of a chair was mounted safely while his
fellowstranger a burly coarselooking man equally gay and rather
more handy made so fierce a rush at his saddle that like vaulting
ambition who oerleaps his selle he fell on tother side or would
have fallen had he not been brought up short by the shoulders of the
ostler at his offstirrup In which shock off came hat and feather

Pardie the bulldogfaced one is a fighting man Dost see Frank he
has had his head broken

That scar came not my son but by a pair of most Catholic and
apostolic scissors My gentle buzzard that is a priests tonsure

Hang the dog O that the sailors may but see it and put him over the
quay head Ive a half mind to go and do it myself

My dear Amyas said Frank laying two fingers on his arm these
men whosoever they are are the guests of our uncle and therefore
the guests of our family Ham gained little by publishing Noahs shame
neither shall we by publishing our uncles

Murrain on you old Franky you never let a man speak his mind and
shame the devil

I have lived long enough in courts old Amyas without a murrain on
you to have found out first that it is not so easy to shame the
devil and secondly that it is better to outwit him and the only way
to do that sweet chuck is very often not to speak your mind at all
We will go down and visit them at Chapel in a day or two and see if we
cannot serve these reynards as the badger did the fox when he found him
in his hole and could not get him out by evil savors

How then

Stuck a sweet nosegay in the door which turned reynards stomach at
once and so overcame evil with good

Well thou art too good for this world thats certain so we will go
home to breakfast Those rogues are out of sight by now

Nevertheless Amyas was not proof against the temptation of going over
to the inndoor and asking who were the gentlemen who went with Mr
Leigh

Gentlemen of Wales said the ostler who came last night in a pinnace
from Milfordhaven and their names Mr Morgan Evans and Mr Evan
Morgans

Mr Judas Iscariot and Mr Iscariot Judas said Amyas between his
teeth and then observed aloud that the Welsh gentlemen seemed rather
poor horsemen

So I said to Mr Leighs groom your worship But he says that those
parts be so uncommon rough and mountainous that the poor gentlemen you
see being enforced to hunt on foot have no such opportunities as young
gentlemen hereabout like your worship whom God preserve and send a
virtuous lady and one worthy of you

Thou hast a villainously glib tongue fellow said Amyas who was
thoroughly out of humor and a sneaking down visage too when I come to
look at you I doubt but you are a Papist too I do

Well sir and what if I am I trust I dont break the queens laws by
that If I dont attend Northam church I pay my months shilling for
the use of the poor as the act directs and beyond that neither you
nor any man dare demand of me

Dare act directs You rascally lawyer you and whence does an ostler
like you get your shilling to pay withal Answer me The examinate
found it so difficult to answer the question that he suddenly became
afflicted with deafness

Do you hear roared Amyas catching at him with his lions paw

Yes missus anon anon missus quoth he to an imaginary landlady
inside and twisting under Amyass hand like an eel vanished into the
house while Frank got the hotheaded youth away

What a plague is one to do then That fellow was a Papist spy

Of course he was said Frank

Then what is one to do if the whole country is full of them

Not to make fools of ourselves about them and so leave them to make
fools of themselves

Thats all very fine butwell I shall remember the villains face if
I see him again

There is no harm in that said Frank

Glad you think so

Dont quarrel with me Amyas the first day

Quarrel with thee my darling old fellow I had sooner kiss the dust
off thy feet if I were worthy of it So now away home my inside cries
cupboard

In the meanwhile Messrs Evans and Morgans were riding away as fast
as the rough bylanes would let them along the fresh coast of the bay
steering carefully clear of Northam town on the one hand and on the
other of Portledge where dwelt that most Protestant justice of the
peace Mr Coffin And it was well for them that neither Amyas Leigh
nor indeed any other loyal Englishman was by when they entered as they
shortly did the lonely woods which stretch along the southern wall of
the bay For there Eustace Leigh pulled up short and both he and his
groom leaping from their horses knelt down humbly in the wet grass
and implored the blessing of the two valiant gentlemen of Wales
who having graciously bestowed it with three fingers apiece became
thenceforth no longer Morgan Evans and Evan Morgans Welshmen and
gentlemen but Father Parsons and Father Gampian Jesuits and gentlemen
in no sense in which that word is applied in this book

After a few minutes the party were again in motion ambling steadily
and cautiously along the high tableland towards Moorwinstow in the
west while beneath them on the right at the mouth of richwooded
glens opened vistas of the bright blue bay and beyond it the sandhills
of Braunton and the ragged rocks of Morte while far away to the north
and west the lonely isle of Lundy hung like a soft gray cloud

But they were not destined to reach their point as peaceably as they
could have wished For just as they got opposite Clovelly dike the huge
old Roman encampment which stands about midway in their journey they
heard a halloo from the valley below answered by a fainter one far
ahead At which like a couple of rogues as indeed they were Father
Campian and Father Parsons looked at each other and then both stared
round at the wild desolate open pasture for the country was then all
unenclosed and the great dark furzegrown banks above their heads and
Campian remarked gently to Parsons that this was a very dreary spot
and likely enough for robbers

A likelier spot for us Father said Eustace punning The old Romans
knew what they were about when they put their legions up aloft here to
overlook land and sea for miles away and we may thank them some day for
their leavings The banks are all sound there is plenty of good water
inside and added he in Latin in case our Spanish friendsyou
understand

Pauca verba my son said Campian but as he spoke up from the ditch
close beside him as if rising out of the earth burst through the
furzebushes an armed cavalier

Pardon gentlemen shouted he as the Jesuit and his horse recoiled
against the groom Stand for your lives

Mater caelorum moaned Campian while Parsons who as all the world
knows was a blustering bully enough at least with his tongue asked
What a murrain right had he to stop honest folks on the queens highway
confirming the same with a mighty oath which he set down as peccatum
veniale on account of the sudden necessity nay indeed fraus pia as
proper to support the character of that valiant gentleman of Wales Mr
Evan Morgans But the horseman taking no notice of his hint dashed
across the nose of Eustace Leighs horse with a Hillo old lad where
ridest so early and peering down for a moment into the ruts of the
narrow trackway struck spurs into his horse shouting A fresh
slot right away for Hartland Forward gentlemen all follow follow
follow

Who is this roysterer asked Parsons loftily

Will Cary of Clovelly an awful heretic and here come more behind

And as he spoke four or five more mounted gallants plunged in and out of
the great dikes and thundered on behind the party whose horses quite
understanding what game was up burst into full gallop neighing and
squealing and in another minute the hapless Jesuits were hurling along
over moor and moss after a hart of grease

Parsons who though a vulgar bully was no coward supported the
character of Mr Evan Morgans well enough and he would have really
enjoyed himself had he not been in agonies of fear lest those precious
saddlebags in front of him should break from their lashings and
rolling to the earth expose to the hoofs of heretic horses perhaps to
the gaze of heretic eyes such a cargo of bulls dispensations secret
correspondences seditious tracts and so forth that at the very
thought of their being seen his head felt loose upon his shoulders But
the future martyr behind him Mr Morgan Evans gave himself up at once
to abject despair and as he bumped and rolled along sought vainly for
comfort in professional ejaculations in the Latin tongue

Mater intemerata Eripe me eUgh I am down Adhaesit pavimento
venterNo I am not El dilectum tuum e potestate canisAh Audisti
me inter cornua unicornium Put this too down inughthy account in
favor of my pooroh sharpness of this saddle Oh whither barbarous
islanders

Now riding on his quarter not in the rough trackway like a cockney
but through the soft heather like a sportsman was a very gallant knight
whom we all know well by this time Richard Grenville by name who had
made Mr Cary and the rest his guests the night before and then ridden
out with them at five oclock that morning after the wholesome early
ways of the time to rouse a wellknown stag in the glens at Buckish by
help of Mr Coffins hounds from Portledge Who being as good a Latiner
as Campians self and overhearing both the scraps of psalm and the
barbarous islanders pushed his horse alongside of Mr Eustace
Leigh and at the first check said with two low bows towards the two
strangers

I hope Mr Leigh will do me the honor of introducing me to his guests
I should be sorry and Mr Cary also that any gentle strangers should
become neighbors of ours even for a day without our knowing who they
are who honor our western Thule with a visit and showing them ourselves
all due requital for the compliment of their presence

After which the only thing which poor Eustace could do especially as
it was spoken loud enough for all bystanders was to introduce in due
form Mr Evan Morgans and Mr Morgan Evans who hearing the name and
what was worse seeing the terrible face with its quiet searching eye
felt like a brace of partridgepoults cowering in the stubble with a
hawk hanging ten feet over their heads

Gentlemen said Sir Richard blandly cap in hand I fear that your
mails must have been somewhat in your way in this unexpected gallop If
you will permit my groom who is behind to disencumber you of them
and carry them to Chapel you will both confer an honor on me and be
enabled yourselves to see the mort more pleasantly

A twinkle of fun in spite of all his efforts played about good Sir
Richards eye as he gave this searching hint The two Welsh gentlemen
stammered out clumsy thanks and pleading great haste and fatigue from
a long journey contrived to fall to the rear and vanish with their
guides as soon as the slot had been recovered

Will said Sir Richard pushing alongside of young Cary

Your worship

Jesuits Will

May the father of lies fly away with them over the nearest cliff

He will not do that while this Irish trouble is about Those fellows
are come to practise here for Saunders and Desmond

Perhaps they have a consecrated banner in their bag the scoundrels
Shall I and young Coffin on and stop them Hard if the honest men may
not rob the thieves once in a way

No give the devil rope and he will hang himself Keep thy tongue at
home and thine eyes too Will

How then

Let Clovelly beach be watched night and day like any mousehole No one
can land round Harty Point with these southwesters Stop every fellow
who has the ghost of an Irish brogue come he in or go he out and send
him over to me

Some one should guard Budehaven sir

Leave that to me Now then forward gentlemen all or the stag will
take the sea at the Abbey

And on they crashed down the Hartland glens through the oakscrub and
the great crownferns and the baying of the slowhound and the tantaras
of the horn died away farther and fainter toward the blue Atlantic
while the conspirators with lightened hearts pricked fast across
Bursdon upon their evil errand But Eustace Leigh had other thoughts
and other cares than the safety of his fathers two mysterious guests
important as that was in his eyes for he was one of the many who had
drunk in sweet poison though in his case it could hardly be called
sweet from the magic glances of the Rose of Torridge He had seen her
in the town and for the first time in his life fallen utterly in love
and now that she had come down close to his fathers house he looked on
her as a lamb fallen unawares into the jaws of the greedy wolf which
he felt himself to be For Eustaces love had little or nothing of
chivalry selfsacrifice or purity in it those were virtues which were
not taught at Rheims Careful as the Jesuits were over the practical
morality of their pupils this severe restraint had little effect in
producing real habits of selfcontrol What little Eustace had learnt of
women from them was as base and vulgar as the rest of their teaching
What could it be else if instilled by men educated in the schools of
Italy and France in the age which produced the foul novels of Cinthio
and Bandello and compelled Rabelais in order to escape the rack and
stake to hide the light of his great wisdom not beneath a bushel but
beneath a dunghill the age in which the Romish Church had made
marriage a legalized tyranny and the laity by a natural and pardonable
revulsion had exalted adultery into a virtue and a science That all
love was lust that all women had their price that profligacy though
an ecclesiastical sin was so pardonable if not necessary as to be
hardly a moral sin were notions which Eustace must needs have gathered
from the hints of his preceptors for their written works bear to this
day fullest and foulest testimony that such was their opinion and that
their conception of the relation of the sexes was really not a whit
higher than that of the profligate laity who confessed to them He
longed to marry Rose Salterne with a wild selfish fury but only that
he might be able to claim her as his own property and keep all others
from her Of her as a coequal and ennobling helpmate as one in whose
honor glory growth of heart and soul his own were inextricably wrapt
up he had never dreamed Marriage would prevent God from being angry
with that with which otherwise He might be angry and therefore the
sanction of the Church was the more probable and safe course But as
yet his suit was in very embryo He could not even tell whether Rose
knew of his love and he wasted miserable hours in maddening thoughts
and tost all night upon his sleepless bed and rose next morning fierce
and pale to invent fresh excuses for going over to her uncles house
and lingering about the fruit which he dared not snatch



CHAPTER IV

THE TWO WAYS OF BEING CROST IN LOVE

 I could not love thee dear so much
 Loved I not honor moreLOVELACE

And what all this while has become of the fair breaker of so many
hearts to whom I have not yet even introduced my readers

She was sitting in the little farmhouse beside the mill buried in the
green depths of the valley of Combe halfway between Stow and Chapel
sulking as much as her sweet nature would let her at being thus
shut out from all the grand doings at Bideford and forced to keep a
Martinmas Lent in that far western glen So lonely was she in fact
that though she regarded Eustace Leigh with somewhat of aversion and
being a good Protestant with a great deal of suspicion she could not
find it in her heart to avoid a chat with him whenever he came down to
the farm and to its mill which he contrived to do on I know not what
wouldbe errand almost every day Her uncle and aunt at first looked
stiff enough at these visits and the latter took care always to make a
third in every conversation but still Mr Leigh was a gentlemans
son and it would not do to be rude to a neighboring squire and a good
customer and Rose was the rich mans daughter and they poor cousins
so it would not do either to quarrel with her and besides the
pretty maid half by wilfulness and half by her sweet winning tricks
generally contrived to get her own way wheresoever she went and
she herself had been wise enough to beg her aunt never to leave them
alonefor she could not abear the sight of Mr Eustace only
she must have some one to talk with down here On which her aunt
considered that she herself was but a simple countrywoman and that
townsfolks ways of course must be very different from hers and that
people knew their own business best and so forth and let things go
on their own way Eustace in the meanwhile who knew well that the
difference in creed between him and Rose was likely to be the very
hardest obstacle in the way of his love took care to keep his private
opinions well in the background and instead of trying to convert the
folk at the mill daily bought milk or flour from them and gave it
away to the old women in Moorwinstow who agreed that after all for
a Papist he was a godly young man enough and at last having taken
counsel with Campian and Parsons on certain political plots then on
foot came with them to the conclusion that they would all three go to
church the next Sunday Where Messrs Evan Morgans and Morgan Evans
having crammed up the rubrics beforehand behaved themselves in a most
orthodox and unexceptionable manner as did also poor Eustace to the
great wonder of all good folks and then went home flattering himself
that he had taken in parson clerk and people not knowing in his
simple unsimplicity and cunning foolishness that each good wife in the
parish was saying to the other He turned Protestant The devil turned
monk Hes only after Mistress Salterne the young hypocrite

But if the two Jesuits found it expedient for the holy cause in which
they were embarked to reconcile themselves outwardly to the powers
that were they were none the less busy in private in plotting their
overthrow

Ever since April last they had been playing at hideandseek through the
length and breadth of England and now they were only lying quiet till
expected news from Ireland should give them their cue and a great
rising of the West should sweep from her throne that stiffnecked
persecuting excommunicate reprobate illegitimate and profligate
usurper who falsely called herself the Queen of England

For they had as stoutly persuaded themselves in those days as they
have in these with a real Baconian contempt of the results of sensible
experience that the heart of England was really with them and that
the British nation was on the point of returning to the bosom of the
Catholic Church and giving up Elizabeth to be led in chains to the feet
of the rightful Lord of Creation the Old Man of the Seven Hills
And this fair hope which has been skipping just in front of them for
centuries always a step farther off like the place where the rainbow
touches the ground they used to announce at times in language which
terrified old Mr Leigh One day indeed as Eustace entered his
fathers private room after his usual visit to the mill he could
hear voices high in dispute Parsons as usual blustering Mr Leigh
peevishly deprecating and Campian who was really the sweetestnatured
of men trying to pour oil on the troubled waters Whereat Eustace for
the good of the cause of course stopped outside and listened

My excellent sir said Mr Leigh does not your very presence here
show how I am affected toward the holy cause of the Catholic faith But
I cannot in the meanwhile forget that I am an Englishman

And what is England said Parsons A heretic and schismatic Babylon
whereof it is written Come out of her my people lest you be partaker
of her plagues Yea what is a country An arbitrary division of
territory by the princes of this world who are naught and come to
naught They are created by the peoples will their existence depends
on the sanction of him to whom all power is given in heaven and
earthour Holy Father the Pope Take away the latter and what is a
kingthe people who have made him may unmake him

My dear sir recollect that I have sworn allegiance to Queen
Elizabeth

Yes sir you have sir and as I have shown at large in my writings
you were absolved from that allegiance from the moment that the bull of
Pius the Fifth declared her a heretic and excommunicate and thereby to
have forfeited all dominion whatsoever I tell you sir what I thought
you should have known already that since the year 1569 England has had
no queen no magistrates no laws no lawful authority whatsoever and
that to own allegiance to any English magistrate sir or to plead in an
English court of law is to disobey the apostolic precept How dare you
go to law before the unbelievers I tell you sir rebellion is now not
merely permitted it is a duty

Take care sir for Gods sake take care said Mr Leigh Right or
wrong I cannot have such language used in my house For the sake of my
wife and children I cannot

My dear brother Parsons deal more gently with the flock interposed
Campian Your opinion though probable as I well know in the eyes of
most of our order is hardly safe enough here the opposite is at least
so safe that Mr Leigh may well excuse his conscience for accepting it
After all are we not sent hither to proclaim this very thing and to
relieve the souls of good Catholics from a burden which has seemed to
them too heavy

Yes said Parsons halfsulkily to allow all Balaams who will to
sacrifice to Baal while they call themselves by the name of the Lord

My dear brother have I not often reminded you that Naaman was allowed
to bow himself in the house of Rimmon And can we therefore complain of
the office to which the Holy Father has appointed us to declare to such
as Mr Leigh his especial grace by which the bull of Pius the Fifth
on whose soul God have mercy shall henceforth bind the queen and the
heretics only but in no ways the Catholics at least as long as the
present tyranny prevents the pious purposes of the bull

Be it so sir be it so Only observe this Mr Leigh that our brother
Campian confesses this to be a tyranny Observe sir that the bull does
still bind the socalled queen and that she and her magistrates are
still none the less usurpers nonentities and shadows of a shade And
observe this sir that when that which is lawful is excused to the
weak it remains no less lawful to the strong The seven thousand who
had not bowed the knee to Baal did not slay his priests but Elijah did
and won to himself a good reward And if the rest of the children of
Israel sinned not in not slaying Eglon yet Ehuds deed was none the
less justified by all laws human and divine

For Heavens sake do not talk so sir or I must leave the room What
have I to do with Ehud and Eglon and slaughters and tyrannies Our
queen is a very good queen if Heaven would but grant her repentance
and turn her to the true faith I have never been troubled about
religion nor any one else that I know of in the West country

You forget Mr Trudgeon of Launceston father and poor Father Mayne
interposed Eustace who had by this time slipped in and Campian added
softly

Yes your West of England also has been honored by its martyrs as well
as my London by the precious blood of Story

What young malapert cried poor Leigh facing round upon his son
glad to find any one on whom he might vent his illhumor are you too
against me with a murrain on you And pray what the devil brought
Cuthbert Mayne to the gallows and turned Mr Trudgeon he was always a
foolish hothead out of house and home but just such treasonable talk
as Mr Parsons must needs hold in my house to make a beggar of me and
my children as he will before he has done

The Blessed Virgin forbid said Campian

The Blessed Virgin forbid But you must help her to forbid it Mr
Campian We should never have had the law of 1571 against bulls and
Agnus Deis and blessed grains if the Popes bull of 1569 had not made
them matter of treason by preventing a poor creatures saving his soul
in the true Church without putting his neck into a halter by denying the
queens authority

What sir almost roared Parsons do you dare to speak evil of the
edicts of the Vicar of Christ

I No I didnt Who says I did All I meant was I am sureMr
Campian you are a reasonable man speak for me

Mr Leigh only meant I am sure that the Holy Fathers prudent
intentions have been so far defeated by the perverseness and invincible
misunderstanding of the heretics that that which was in itself meant
for the good of the oppressed English Catholics has been perverted to
their harm

And thus reverend sir said Eustace glad to get into his fathers
good graces again my father attaches blame not to the PopeHeaven
forbidbut to the pravity of his enemies

And it is for this very reason said Campian that we have brought
with us the present merciful explanation of the bull

Ill tell you what gentlemen said Mr Leigh who like other weak
men grew in valor as his opponent seemed inclined to make peace I
dont think the declaration was needed After the new law of 1571 was
made it was never put in force till Mayne and Trudgeon made fools of
themselves and that was full six years There were a few offenders
they say who were brought up and admonished and let go but even that
did not happen down here and need not happen now unless you put my son
here for you shall never put me I warrant you upon some deed which
had better be left alone and so bring us all to shame

Your son sir if not openly vowed to God has I hope a due sense
of that inward vocation which we have seen in him and reverences his
spiritual fathers too well to listen to the temptations of his earthly
father

What sir will you teach my son to disobey me

Your son is ours also sir This is strange language in one who owes a
debt to the Church which it was charitably fancied he meant to pay in
the person of his child

These last words touched poor Mr Leigh in a sore point and breaking
all bounds he swore roundly at Parsons who stood foaming with rage

A plague upon you sir and a black assizes for you for you will come
to the gallows yet Do you mean to taunt me in my own house with that
Hartland land You had better go back and ask those who sent you where
the dispensation to hold the land is which they promised to get me
years ago and have gone on putting me off till they have got my money
and my son and my conscience and I vow before all the saints seem now
to want my head over and above God help meand the poor mans eyes
fairly filled with tears

Now was Eustaces turn to be roused for after all he was an
Englishman and a gentleman and he said kindly enough but firmly

Courage my dearest father Remember that I am still your son and not
a Jesuit yet and whether I ever become one I promise you will depend
mainly on the treatment which you meet with at the hands of these
reverend gentlemen for whom I as having brought them hither must
consider myself as surety to you

If a powderbarrel had exploded in the Jesuits faces they could not
have been more amazed Campian looked blank at Parsons and Parsons at
Campian till the stouterhearted of the two recovering his breath at
last

Sir do you know sir the curse pronounced on those who after putting
their hand to the plough look back

Eustace was one of those impulsive men with a lack of moral courage
who dare raise the devil but never dare fight him after he has been
raised and he now tried to pass off his speech by winking and making
signs in the direction of his father as much as to say that he was only
trying to quiet the old mans fears But Campian was too frightened
Parsons too angry to take his hints and he had to carry his part
through

All I read is Father Parsons that such are not fit for the kingdom of
God of which high honor I have for some time past felt myself unworthy
I have much doubt just now as to my vocation and in the meanwhile have
not forgotten that I am a citizen of a free country And so saying he
took his fathers arm and walked out

His last words had hit the Jesuits hard They had put the poor
cobwebspinners in mind of the humiliating fact which they have had
thrust on them daily from that time till now and yet have never learnt
the lesson that all their scholastic cunning plotting intriguing
bulls pardons indulgences and the rest of it are on this side
the Channel a mere enchanters cloudcastle and Fata Morgana which
vanishes into empty air by one touch of that magic wand the constables
staff A citizen of a free countrythere was the rub and they
looked at each other in more utter perplexity than ever At last Parsons
spoke

Theres a woman in the wind Ill lay my life on it I saw him blush up
crimson yesterday when his mother asked him whether some Rose Salterne
or other was still in the neighborhood

A woman Well the spirit may be willing though the flesh be weak We
will inquire into this The youth may do us good service as a layman
and if anything should happen to his elder brother whom the saints
protect he is heir to some wealth In the meanwhile our dear brother
Parsons will perhaps see the expediency of altering our tactics somewhat
while we are here

And thereupon a long conversation began between the two who had been
sent together after the wise method of their order in obedience to the
precept Two are better than one in order that Campian might restrain
Parsons vehemence and Parsons spur on Campians gentleness and so
each act as the supplement of the other and each also it must be
confessed gave advice pretty nearly contradictory to his fellows if
occasion should require without the danger as their writers have it
of seeming changeable and inconsistent

The upshot of this conversation was that in a day or two during which
time Mr Leigh and Eustace also had made the amende honorable and
matters went smoothly enough Father Campian asked Father Francis
the household chaplain to allow him as an especial favor to hear
Eustaces usual confession on the ensuing Friday

Poor Father Francis dared not refuse so great a man and assented with
an inward groan knowing well that the intent was to worm out some
family secrets whereby his power would be diminished and the Jesuits
increased For the regular priesthood and the Jesuits throughout England
were toward each other in a state of armed neutrality which wanted but
little at any moment to become open war as it did in James the Firsts
time when those meek missionaries by their gentle moral tortures
literally hunted to death the poor Popish bishop of Hippopotamus that
is to say London for the time being

However Campian heard Eustaces confession and by putting to him such
questions as may be easily conceived by those who know anything about
the confessional discovered satisfactorily enough that he was what
Campian would have called in love though I should question much
the propriety of the term as applied to any facts which poor prurient
Campian discovered or indeed knew how to discover seeing that a swine
has no eye for pearls But he had found out enough he smiled and set
to work next vigorously to discover who the lady might be

If he had frankly said to Eustace I feel for you and if your desires
are reasonable or lawful or possible I will help you with all my
heart and soul he might have had the young mans secret heart and
saved himself an hours trouble but of course he took instinctively
the crooked and suspicious method expected to find the case the worst
possibleas a man was bound to do who had been trained to take the
lowest possible view of human nature and to consider the basest motives
as the mainspring of all human actionand began his moral torture
accordingly by a series of delicate questions which poor Eustace dodged
in every possible way though he knew that the good father was too
cunning for him and that he must give in at last Nevertheless like a
rabbit who runs squealing round and round before the weasel into whose
jaws it knows that it must jump at last by force of fascination he
parried and parried and pretended to be stupid and surprised and
honorably scrupulous and even angry while every question as to her
being married or single Catholic or heretic English or foreign
brought his tormentor a step nearer the goal At last when Campian
finding the business not such a very bad one had asked something about
her worldly wealth Eustace saw a door of escape and sprang at it

Even if she be a heretic she is heiress to one of the wealthiest
merchants in Devon

Ah said Campian thoughtfully And she is but eighteen you say

Only eighteen

Ah well my son there is time She may be reconciled to the Church
or you may change

I shall die first

Ah poor lad Well she may be reconciled and her wealth may be of use
to the cause of Heaven

And it shall be of use Only absolve me and let me be at peace Let
me have but her he cried piteously I do not want her wealthnot I
Let me have but her and that but for one year one month one dayand
all the restmoney fame talents yea my life itself hers if it be
neededare at the service of Holy Church Ay I shall glory in showing
my devotion by some special sacrificesome desperate deed Prove me
now and see what there is I will not do

And so Eustace was absolved after which Campian added

This is indeed well my son for there is a thing to be done now but
it may be at the risk of life

Prove me cried Eustace impatiently

Here is a letter which was brought me last night no matter from
whence you can understand it better than I and I longed to have shown
it you but that I feared my son had become

You feared wrongly then my dear Father Campian

So Campian translated to him the cipher of the letter

This to Evan Morgans gentleman at Mr Leighs house in Moorwinstow
Devonshire News may be had by one who will go to the shore of Clovelly
any evening after the 25th of November at dead low tide and there
watch for a boat rowed by one with a red beard and a Portugal by his
speech If he be asked How many he will answer Eight hundred and
one Take his letters and read them If the shore be watched let him
who comes show a light three times in a safe place under the cliff
above the town below is dangerous landing Farewell and expect great
things

I will go said Eustace tomorrow is the 25th and I know a sure and
easy place Your friend seems to know these shores well

Ah what is it we do not know said Campian with a mysterious smile
And now

And now to prove to you how I trust to you you shall come with me
and see thisthe lady of whom I spoke and judge for yourself whether
my fault is not a venial one

Ah my son have I not absolved you already What have I to do with
fair faces Nevertheless I will come both to show you that I trust
you and it may be to help towards reclaiming a heretic and saving a
lost soul who knows

So the two set out together and as it was appointed they had just got
to the top of the hill between Chapel and Stow mill when up the lane
came none other than Mistress Rose Salterne herself in all the glories
of a new scarlet hood from under which her large dark languid eyes
gleamed soft lightnings through poor Eustaces heart and marrow Up
to them she tripped on delicate ankles and tiny feet tall lithe and
graceful a true Westcountry lass and as she passed them with a
pretty blush and courtesy even Campian looked back at the fair innocent
creature whose long dark curls after the then country fashion rolled
down from beneath the hood below her waist entangling the soul of
Eustace Leigh within their glossy nets

There whispered he trembling from head to foot Can you excuse me
now

I had excused you long ago said the kindhearted father Alas that
so much fair red and white should have been created only as a feast for
worms

A feast for gods you mean cried Eustace on whose common sense the
naive absurdity of the last speech struck keenly and then as if to
escape the scolding which he deserved for his heathenry

Will you let me return for a moment I will follow you let me go

Campian saw that it was of no use to say no and nodded Eustace darted
from his side and running across a field met Rose full at the next
turn of the road

She started and gave a pretty little shriek

Mr Leigh I thought you had gone forward

I came back to speak to you RoseMistress Salterne I mean

To me

To you I must speak tell you all or die And he pressed up close to
her She shrank back somewhat frightened

Do not stir do not go I implore you Rose only hear me And
fiercely and passionately seizing her by the hand he poured out the
whole story of his love heaping her with every fantastic epithet of
admiration which he could devise

There was little perhaps of all his words which Rose had not heard
many a time before but there was a quiver in his voice and a fire in
his eye from which she shrank by instinct

Let me go she said you are too rough sir

Ay he said seizing now both her hands rougher perhaps than the
gay gallants of Bideford who serenade you and write sonnets to you
and send you posies Rougher but more loving Rose Do not turn away
I shall die if you take your eyes off me Tell metell me now
herethis momentbefore we partif I may love you

Go away she answered struggling and bursting into tears This is
too rude If I am but a merchants daughter I am Gods child Remember
that I am alone Leave me go or I will call for help

Eustace had heard or read somewhere that such expressions in a womans
mouth were mere facons de parler and on the whole signs that she had no
objection to be alone and did not intend to call for help and he only
grasped her hands the more fiercely and looked into her face with keen
and hungry eyes but she was in earnest nevertheless and a loud shriek
made him aware that if he wished to save his own good name he must
go but there was one question for an answer to which he would risk his
very life

Yes proud woman I thought so Some one of those gay gallants has been
beforehand with me Tell me who

But she broke from him and passed him and fled down the lane

Mark it cried he after her You shall rue the day when you despised
Eustace Leigh Mark it proud beauty And he turned back to join
Campian who stood in some trepidation

You have not hurt the maiden my son I thought I heard a scream

Hurt her No Would God that she were dead nevertheless and I by her
Say no more to me father We will home Even Campian knew enough of
the world to guess what had happened and they both hurried home in
silence

And so Eustace Leigh played his move and lost it

Poor little Rose having run nearly to Chapel stopped for very shame
and walked quietly by the cottages which stood opposite the gate and
then turned up the lane towards Moorwinstow village whither she was
bound But on second thoughts she felt herself so red and flustered
that she was afraid of going into the village for fear as she said to
herself of making people talk and so turning into a bypath struck
away toward the cliffs to cool her blushes in the seabreeze And there
finding a quiet grassy nook beneath the crest of the rocks she sat down
on the turf and fell into a great meditation

Rose Salterne was a thorough specimen of a Westcoast maiden full of
passionate impulsive affections and wild dreamy imaginations a fit
subject as the NorthDevon women are still for all romantic and gentle
superstitions Left early without mothers care she had fed her fancy
upon the legends and ballads of her native land till she believedwhat
did she not believeof mermaids and pixies charms and witches
dreams and omens and all that world of magic in which most of the
countrywomen and countrymen too believed firmly enough but twenty
years ago Then her fathers house was seldom without some merchant or
seacaptain from foreign parts who like Othello had his tales of

 Antres vast and deserts idle
 Of rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads reach heaven

And

 And of the cannibals that each other eat
 The anthropophagi and men whose heads
 Do grow beneath their shoulders

All which tales she like Desdemona devoured with greedy ears
whenever she could the house affairs with haste despatch And when
these failed there was still boundless store of wonders open to her in
old romances which were then to be found in every English house of the
better class The Legend of King Arthur Florice and Blancheflour Sir
Ysumbras Sir Guy of Warwick Palamon and Arcite and the Romaunt of the
Rose were with her textbooks and canonical authorities And lucky it
was perhaps for her that Sidneys Arcadia was still in petto or Mr
Frank who had already seen the first book or two in manuscript and
extolled it above all books past present or to come would have surely
brought a copy down for Rose and thereby have turned her poor little
flighty brains upside down forever And with her head full of these it
was no wonder if she had likened herself of late more than once to some
of those peerless princesses of old for whose fair hand paladins and
kaisers thundered against each other in tilted field and perhaps she
would not have been sorry provided of course no one was killed if
duels and passages of arms in honor of her as her father reasonably
dreaded had actually taken place

For Rose was not only well aware that she was wooed but found the said
wooing and little shame to her a very pleasant process Not that she
had any wish to break hearts she did not break her heart for any of her
admirers and why should they break theirs for her They were all very
charming each in his way the gentlemen at least for she had long
since learnt to turn up her nose at merchants and burghers but one of
them was not so very much better than the other

Of course Mr Frank Leigh was the most charming but then as a
courtier and squire of dames he had never given her a sign of real
love nothing but sonnets and compliments and there was no trusting
such things from a gallant who was said though by the by most
scandalously to have a lady love at Milan and another at Vienna and
halfadozen in the Court and halfadozen more in the city

And very charming was Mr William Cary with his quips and his jests
and his galliards and lavoltas over and above his rich inheritance
but then charming also Mr Coffin of Portledge though he were a little
proud and stately but which of the two should she choose It would be
very pleasant to be mistress of Clovelly Court but just as pleasant to
find herself lady of Portledge where the Coffins had lived ever since
Noahs flood if indeed they had not merely returned thither after
that temporary displacement and to bring her wealth into a family
which was as proud of its antiquity as any nobleman in Devon and might
have made a fourth to that famous trio of Devonshire Cs of which it is
written

 Crocker Cruwys and Copplestone
 When the Conqueror came were all at home

And Mr Hugh Fortescue toopeople said that he was certain to become a
great soldierperhaps as great as his brother Arthurand that would
be pleasant enough too though he was but the younger son of an
innumerable family but then so was Amyas Leigh Ah poor Amyas Her
girls fancy for him had vanished or rather perhaps it was very much
what it always had been only that four or five more girls fancies
beside it had entered in and kept it in due subjection But still she
could not help thinking a good deal about him and his voyage and the
reports of his great strength and beauty and valor which had already
reached her in that outoftheway corner and though she was not in the
least in love with him she could not help hoping that he had at least
to put her pretty little thought in the mildest shape not altogether
forgotten her and was hungering too with all her fancy to give him
no peace till he had told her all the wonderful things which he had seen
and done in this evermemorable voyage So that altogether it was no
wonder if in her last nights dream the figure of Amyas had been even
more forward and troublesome than that of Frank or the rest

But moreover another figure had been forward and troublesome enough in
last nights sleepworld and forward and troublesome enough too now
in todays wakingworld namely Eustace the rejected How strange
that she should have dreamt of him the night before and dreamt too
of his fighting with Mr Frank and Mr Amyas It must be a warningsee
she had met him the very next day in this strange way so the first half
of her dream had come true and after what had past she only had to
breathe a whisper and the second part of the dream would come true
also If she wished for a passage of arms in her own honor she could
easily enough compass one not that she would do it for worlds And
after all though Mr Eustace had been very rude and naughty yet still
it was not his own fault he could not help being in love with her
Andand in short the poor little maid felt herself one of the most
important personages on earth with all the cares or hearts of the
country in her keeping and as much perplexed with matters of weight as
ever was any Cleophila or Dianeme Fiordispina or Flourdeluce in verse
run tame or prose run mad

Poor little Rose Had she but had a mother But she was to learn her
lesson such as it was in another school She was too shy too proud
perhaps to tell her aunt her mighty troubles but a counsellor she must
have and after sitting with her head in her hands for halfanhour
or more she arose suddenly and started off along the cliffs towards
Marsland She would go and see Lucy Passmore the white witch Lucy knew
everything Lucy would tell her what to do perhaps even whom to marry

Lucy was a fat jolly woman of fifty with little pigeyes which
twinkled like sparks of fire and eyebrows which sloped upwards and
outwards like those of a satyr as if she had been as indeed she had
all her life looking out of the corners of her eyes Her qualifications
as white witch were boundless cunning equally boundless good nature
considerable knowledge of human weaknesses some mesmeric power some
skill in yarbs as she called her simples a firm faith in the virtue
of her own incantations and the faculty of holding her tongue By dint
of these she contrived to gain a fair share of money and also which
she liked even better of power among the simple folk for many miles
round If a child was scalded a tooth ached a piece of silver was
stolen a heifer shrewstruck a pig bewitched a young damsel crost in
love Lucy was called in and Lucy found a remedy especially for the
latter complaint Now and then she found herself on ticklish ground for
the kindheartedness which compelled her to help all distressed damsels
out of a scrape sometimes compelled her also to help them into one
whereon enraged fathers called Lucy ugly names and threatened to send
her into Exeter gaol for a witch and she smiled quietly and hinted
that if she were like some that were ready to return evil for evil
such talk as that would bring no blessing on them that spoke it which
being translated into plain English meant If you trouble me I will
overlook i e fascinate you and then your pigs will die your horses
stray your cream turn sour your barns be fired your son have St
Vituss dance your daughter fits and so on woe on woe till you are
very probably starved to death in a ditch by virtue of this terrible
little eye of mine at which in spite of all your swearing and
bullying you know you are now shaking in your shoes for fear So you
had much better hold your tongue give me a drink of cider and leave
ill alone lest you make it worse

Not that Lucy ever proceeded to any such fearful extremities On the
contrary her boast and her belief too was that she was sent into
the world to make poor souls as happy as she could by lawful means
of course if possible but if notwhy unlawful ones were better than
none for she couldnt abear to see the poor creatures taking on
she was too too tenderhearted And so she was to every one but her
husband a tall simplehearted rabbitfaced man a good deal older than
herself Fully agreeing with Sir Richard Grenvilles great axiom
that he who cannot obey cannot rule Lucy had been for the last
fiveandtwenty years training him pretty smartly to obey her with the
intention it is to be charitably hoped of letting him rule her in
turn when his lesson was perfected He bore his honors however meekly
enough having a boundless respect for his wifes wisdom and a firm
belief in her supernatural powers and let her go her own way and earn
her own money while he got a little more in a truly pastoral method
not extinct yet along those lonely cliffs by feeding a herd of some
dozen donkeys and twenty goats The donkeys fetched at each lowtide
white shellsand which was to be sold for manure to the neighboring
farmers the goats furnished milk and kiddypies and when there was
neither milking nor sandcarrying to be done old Will Passmore just
sat under a sunny rock and watched the buckgoats rattle their horns
together thinking about nothing at all and taking very good care
all the while neither to inquire nor to see who came in and out of his
little cottage in the glen

The prophetess when Rose approached her oracular cave was seated on
a tripod in front of the fire distilling strong waters out of
pennyroyal But no sooner did her distinguished visitor appear at the
hatch than the still was left to take care of itself and a clean
apron and mutch having been slipt on Lucy welcomed Rose with endless
courtesies andBless my dear soul alive who ever would have thought
to see the Rose of Torridge to my poor little place

Rose sat down and then How to begin was more than she knew and she
stayed silent a full five minutes looking earnestly at the point of
her shoe till Lucy who was an adept in such cases thought it best
to proceed to business at once and save Rose the delicate operation
of opening the ball herself and so in her own way half fawning half
familiar

Well my dear young lady and what is it I can do for ye For I guess
you want a bit of old Lucys help eh Though Im most mazed to see ye
here surely I should have supposed that pretty face could manage they
sort of matters for itself Eh

Rose thus bluntly charged confessed at once and with many blushes and
hesitations made her soon understand that what she wanted was To have
her fortune told

Eh Oh I see The pretty face has managed it a bit too well already
eh Tu many o mun pure fellows Well taint every mayden has her
pick and choose like some I know of as be blest in love by stars
above So you haint made up your mind then

Rose shook her head

Ahwell she went on in a halfbantering tone Not so asy is it
then Ones gude for one thing and one for another eh One has the
blood and another the money

And so the cunning woman as she truly was talking half to herself
ran over all the names which she thought likely peering at Rose all the
while out of the corners of her foxy bright eyes while Rose stirred the
peat ashes steadfastly with the point of her little shoe half angry
half ashamed half frightened to find that the cunning woman had
guessed so well both her suitors and her thoughts about them and tried
to look unconcerned at each name as it came out

Well well said Lucy who took nothing by her move simply because
there was nothing to take think over itthink over it my dear life
and if you did set your mind on any onewhy thenthen maybe I might
help you to a sight of him

A sight of him

His sperrit dear life his sperrit only I mane I udnt have no
keeping company in my house no not for gowld untowld I udnt but
the sperrit of munto see whether mun would be true or not youd like
to know that now udnt you my darling

Rose sighed and stirred the ashes about vehemently

I must first know who it is to be If you could show me thatnow

Oh I can show ye that tu I can Ben theres a way to t a sure way
but tis mortal cold for the time o year you zee

But what is it then said Rose who had in her heart been longing for
something of that very kind and had half made up her mind to ask for a
charm

Why youm not afraid to goo into the say by night for a minute are
you And tomorrow night would serve too t will be just low tide to
midnight

If you would come with me perhaps

Ill come Ill come and stand within call to be sure Only do ye
mind this dear soul alive not to goo telling a crumb about mun noo
not for the world or yull see naught at all indeed now And beside
theres a noxious business growd up against me up to Chapel there and
I hear tell how Mr Leigh saith I shall to Exeter gaol for a witchdid
ye ever hear the likesbecause his groom Jan saith I overlooked
munthe Papist dog And now never he nor th owld Father Francis goo by
me without a spetting and saying of their Ayes and MalificasI do
know what their Rooman Latin do mane zo well as ever they I duand a
making o their charms and incantations to their saints and idols They
be mortal feared of witches they Papists and mortal hard on em even
on a pure body like me that doth a bit in the white way case why you
see dear life said she with one of her humorous twinkles tu to a
trade do never agree Do ye try my bit of a charm now do ye

Rose could not resist the temptation and between them both the charm
was agreed on and the next night was fixed for its trial on the
payment of certain current coins of the realm for Lucy of course
must live by her trade and slipping a tester into the dames hand as
earnest Rose went away home and got there in safety

But in the meanwhile at the very hour that Eustace had been prosecuting
his suit in the lane at Moorwinstow a very different scene was being
enacted in Mrs Leighs room at Burrough

For the night before Amyas as he was going to bed heard his brother
Frank in the next room tune his lute and then begin to sing And
both their windows being open and only a thin partition between the
chambers Amyass admiring ears came in for every word of the following
canzonet sung in that delicate and mellow tenor voice for which Frank
was famed among all fair ladies

 Ah tyrant Love Megaeras serpents bearing
 Why thus requite my sighs with venomd smart
 Ah ruthless dove the vultures talons wearing
 Why flesh them traitress in this faithful heart
 Is this my meed Must dragons teeth alone
 In Venus lawns by lovers hands be sown

 Nay gentlest Cupid twas my pride undid me
 Nay guiltless dove by mine own wound I fell
 To worship not to wed Celestials bid me
 I dreamt to mate in heaven and wake in hell
 Forever doomd Ixionlike to reel
 On mine own passions everburning wheel

At which the simple sailor sighed and longed that he could write such
neat verses and sing them so sweetly How he would besiege the ear
of Rose Salterne with amorous ditties But still he could not be
everything and if he had the bone and muscle of the family it was but
fair that Frank should have the brains and voice and after all he was
bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and it was just the same as
if he himself could do all the fine things which Frank could do for as
long as one of the family won honor what matter which of them it was
Whereon he shouted through the wall Good night old songthrush I
suppose I need not pay the musicians

What awake answered Frank Come in here and lull me to sleep with
a seasong

So Amyas went in and found Frank laid on the outside of his bed not yet
undrest

I am a bad sleeper said he I spend more time I fear in burning
the midnight oil than prudent men should Come and be my jongleur
my minnesinger and tell me about Andes and cannibals and the
iceregions and the fireregions and the paradises of the West

So Amyas sat down and told but somehow every story which he tried to
tell came round by crooked paths yet sure to none other point than
Rose Salterne and how he thought of her here and thought of her there
and how he wondered what she would say if she had seen him in this
adventure and how he longed to have had her with him to show her that
glorious sight till Frank let him have his own way and then out came
the whole story of the simple fellows daily and hourly devotion to her
through those three long years of worldwide wanderings

And oh Frank I could hardly think of anything but her in the church
the other day God forgive me and it did seem so hard for her to be the
only face which I did not seeand have not seen her yet either

So I thought dear lad said Frank with one of his sweetest smiles
and tried to get her father to let her impersonate the nymph of
Torridge

Did you you dear kind fellow That would have been too delicious

Just so too delicious wherefore I suppose it was ordained not to
be that which was being delicious enough

And is she as pretty as ever

Ten times as pretty dear lad as half the young fellows round have
discovered If you mean to win her and wear her and God grant you may
fare no worse you will have rivals enough to get rid of

Humph said Amyas I hope I shall not have to make short work with
some of them

I hope not said Frank laughing Now go to bed and tomorrow
morning give your sword to mother to keep lest you should be tempted to
draw it on any of her majestys lieges

No fear of that Frank I am no swashbuckler thank God but if any
one gets in my way Ill serve him as the mastiff did the terrier
and just drop him over the quay into the river to cool himself or my
names not Amyas

And the giant swung himself laughing out of the room and slept all
night like a seal not without dreams of course of Rose Salterne

The next morning according to his wont he went into his mothers room
whom he was sure to find up and at her prayers for he liked to say his
prayers too by her side as he used to do when he was a little boy It
seemed so homelike he said after three years knocking up and down
in nomans land But coming gently to the door for fear of disturbing
her and entering unperceived beheld a sight which stopped him short

Mrs Leigh was sitting in her chair with her face bowed fondly down
upon the head of his brother Frank who knelt before her his face
buried in her lap Amyas could see that his whole form was quivering
with stifled emotion Their mother was just finishing the last words
of a wellknown textfor my sake and the Gospels shall receive a
hundredfold in this present life fathers and mothers and brothers
and sisters

But not a wife interrupted Frank with a voice stifled with sobs
that was too precious a gift for even Him to promise to those who gave
up a first love for His sake

And yet said he after a moments silence has He not heaped me with
blessings enough already that I must repine and rage at His refusing me
one more even though that one beNo mother I am your son and Gods
and you shall know it even though Amyas never does And he looked up
with his clear blue eyes and white forehead and his face was as the
face of an angel

Both of them saw that Amyas was present and started and blushed His
mother motioned him away with her eyes and he went quietly out as one
stunned Why had his name been mentioned

Love cunning love told him all at once This was the meaning of last
nights canzonet This was why its words had seemed to fit his own heart
so well His brother was his rival And he had been telling him all his
love last night What a stupid brute he was How it must have made poor
Frank wince And then Frank had listened so kindly even bid him God
speed in his suit What a gentleman old Frank was to be sure No wonder
the queen was so fond of him and all the Court ladiesWhy if it
came to that what wonder if Rose Salterne should be fond of him too
Heyday That would be a pretty fish to find in my net when I come to
haul it quoth Amyas to himself as he paced the garden and clutching
desperately hold of his locks with both hands as if to hold his poor
confused head on its shoulders he strode and tramped up and down the
shellpaved garden walks for a full half hour till Franks voice as
cheerful as ever though he more than suspected all called him

Come in to breakfast lad and stop grinding and creaking upon those
miserable limpets before thou hast set every tooth in my head on edge

Amyas whether by dint of holding his head straight or by higher means
had got the thoughts of the said head straight enough by this time and
in he came and fell to upon the broiled fish and strong ale with a
sort of fury as determined to do his duty to the utmost in all matters
that day and therefore of course in that most important matter of
bodily sustenance while his mother and Frank looked at him not without
anxiety and even terror doubting what turn his fancy might have taken
in so new a case at last

My dear Amyas you will really heat your blood with all that strong
ale Remember those who drink beer think beer

Then they think right good thoughts mother And in the meanwhile
those who drink water think water Eh old Frank and heres your
health

And clouds are water said his mother somewhat reassured by his
genuine good humor and so are rainbows and clouds are angels
thrones and rainbows the sign of Gods peace on earth

Amyas understood the hint and laughed Then Ill pledge Frank out
of the next ditch if it please you and him But firstI sayhe must
hearken to a parable a manner mystery miracle play I have got in
my head like what they have at Easter to the townhall Now then
hearken madam and I and Frank will act And up rose Amyas and shoved
back his chair and put on a solemn face

Mrs Leigh looked up trembling and Frank he scarce knew why rose

No you pitch again You are King David and sit still upon your
throne David was a great singer you know and a player on the viols
and ruddy too and of a fair countenance so that will fit Now then
mother dont look so frightened I am not going to play Goliath for
all my cubits I am to present Nathan the prophet Now David hearken
for I have a message unto thee O King

There were two men in one city one rich and the other poor and the
rich man had many flocks and herds and all the fine ladies in Whitehall
to court if he liked and the poor man had nothing but

And in spite of his broad honest smile Amyass deep voice began to
tremble and choke

Frank sprang up and burst into tears Oh Amyas my brother my
brother stop I cannot endure this Oh God was it not enough to have
entangled myself in this fatal fancy but over and above I must meet
the shame of my brothers discovering it

What shame then Id like to know said Amyas recovering himself
Look here brother Frank Ive thought it all over in the garden and
I was an ass and a braggart for talking to you as I did last night
Of course you love her Everybody must and I was a fool for not
recollecting that and if you love her your taste and mine agree and
what can be better I think you are a sensible fellow for loving her
and you think me one And as for who has her why youre the eldest
and first come first served is the rule and best to keep to it
Besides brother Frank though Im no scholar yet Im not so blind but
that I tell the difference between you and me and of course your chance
against mine for a hundred to one and I am not going to be fool enough
to row against wind and tide too Im good enough for her I hope but
if I am you are better and the good dog may run but its the best
that takes the hare and so I have nothing more to do with the matter
at all and if you marry her why it will set the old house on its legs
again and thats the first thing to be thought of and you may just as
well do it as I and better too Not but that its a plague a horrible
plague went on Amyas with a ludicrously doleful visage but so
are other things too by the dozen its all in the days work as the
huntsman said when the lion ate him One would never get through the
furzecroft if one stopped to pull out the prickles The pig didnt
scramble out of the ditch by squeaking and the less said the sooner
mended nobody was sent into the world only to suck honeypots What
must be must man is but dust if you cant get crumb you must fain
eat crust So Ill go and join the army in Ireland and get it out of
my head for cannon balls fright away love as well as poverty does and
thats all Ive got to say Wherewith Amyas sat down and returned to
the beer while Mrs Leigh wept tears of joy

Amyas Amyas said Frank you must not throw away the hopes of years
and for me too Oh how just was your parable Ah mother mine to
what use is all my scholarship and my philosophy when this dear simple
sailorlad outdoes me at the first trial of courtesy

My children my children which of you shall I love best Which of you
is the more noble I thanked God this morning for having given me one
such son but to have found that I possess two And Mrs Leigh laid her
head on the table and buried her face in her hands while the generous
battle went on

But dearest Amyas

But Frank if you dont hold your tongue I must go forth It
was quite trouble enough to make up ones mind without having you
afterwards trying to unmake it again

Amyas if you give her up to me God do so to me and more also if I
do not hereby give her up to you

He had done it alreadythis morning said Mrs Leigh looking up
through her tears He renounced her forever on his knees before me
only he is too noble to tell you so

The more reason I should copy him said Amyas setting his lips and
trying to look desperately determined and then suddenly jumping up
he leaped upon Frank and throwing his arms round his neck sobbed out
There there now For Gods sake let us forget all and think about
our mother and the old house and how we may win her honor before we
die and that will be enough to keep our hands full without fretting
about this woman and thatWhat an ass I have been for years instead
of learning my calling dreaming about her and dont know at this
minute whether she cares more for me than she does for her fathers
prentices

Oh Amyas every word of yours puts me to fresh shame Will you believe
that I know as little of her likings as you do

Dont tell me that and play the devils game by putting fresh hopes
into me when I am trying to kick them out I wont believe it If she
is not a fool she must love you and if she dont why be hanged if
she is worth loving

My dearest Amyas I must ask you too to make no more such speeches to
me All those thoughts I have forsworn

Only this morning so there is time to catch them again before they are
gone too far

Only this morning said Frank with a quiet smile but centuries have
passed since then

Centuries I dont see many gray hairs yet

I should not have been surprised if you had though answered Frank
in so sad and meaning a tone that Amyas could only answer

Well you are an angel

You at least are something even more to the purpose for you are a
man

And both spoke truth and so the battle ended and Frank went to his
books while Amyas who must needs be doing if he was not to dream
started off to the dockyard to potter about a new ship of Sir Richards
and forget his woes in the capacity of Sir Oracle among the sailors
And so he had played his move for Rose even as Eustace had and lost
her but not as Eustace had



CHAPTER V

CLOVELLY COURT IN THE OLDEN TIME

 It was among the ways of good Queen Bess
 Who ruled as well as ever mortal can sir
 When she was stoggd and the country in a mess
 She was wont to send for a Devon man sir

 West Country Song

The next morning Amyas Leigh was not to be found Not that he had gone
out to drown himself in despair or even to bemoan himself down by the
Torridge side He had simply ridden off Frank found to Sir Richard
Grenville at Stow his mother at once divined the truth that he was
gone to try for a post in the Irish army and sent off Frank after him
to bring him home again and make him at least reconsider himself

So Frank took horse and rode thereon ten miles or more and then as
there were no inns on the road in those days or indeed in these and
he had some ten miles more of hilly road before him he turned down
the hill towards Clovelly Court to obtain after the hospitable humane
fashion of those days good entertainment for man and horse from Mr
Cary the squire

And when he walked selfinvited like the loudshouting Menelaus into
the long dark wainscoted hall of the court the first object he beheld
was the mighty form of Amyas who seated at the long table was
alternately burying his face in a pasty and the pasty in his face his
sorrows having as it seemed only sharpened his appetite while young
Will Cary kneeling on the opposite bench with his elbows on the table
was in that graceful attitude laying down the law fiercely to him in a
low voice

Hillo lad cried Amyas come hither and deliver me out of the hands
of this fireeater who I verily believe will kill me if I do not let
him kill some one else

Ah Mr Frank said Will Cary who like all other young gentlemen of
these parts held Frank in high honor and considered him a very oracle
and cynosure of fashion and chivalry welcome here I was just longing
for you too I wanted your advice on halfadozen matters Sit down
and eat There is the ale

None so early thank you

Ah no said Amyas burying his head in the tankard and then mimicking
Frank avoid strong ale o mornings It heats the blood thickens
the animal spirits and obfuscates the cerebrum with frenetical and
lymphatic idols which cloud the quintessential light of the pure
reason Eh young Plato young Daniel come hither to judgment And yet
though I cannot see through the bottom of the tankard already I can see
plain enough still to see this that Will shall not fight

Shall I not eh who says that Mr Frank I appeal to you now only
hear

We are in the judgmentseat said Frank settling to the pasty
Proceed appellant

Well I was telling Amyas that Tom Coffin of Portledge I will stand
him no longer

Let him be then said Amyas he could stand very well by himself
when I saw him last

Plague on you hold your tongue Has he any right to look at me as he
does whenever I pass him

That depends on how he looks a cat may look at a king provided she
dont take him for a mouse

Oh I know how he looks and what he means too and he shall stop or I
will stop him And the other day when I spoke of Rose SalterneAh
groaned Frank Ates apple againnever mind what I said he burst
out laughing in my face and is not that a fair quarrel And what is
more I know that he wrote a sonnet and sent it to her to Stow by a
market woman What right has he to write sonnets when I cant Its not
fair play Mr Frank or I am a Jew and a Spaniard and a Papist its
not And Will smote the table till the plates danced again

My dear knight of the burning pestle I have a plan a device a
disentanglement according to most approved rules of chivalry Let us
fix a day and summon by tuck of drum all young gentlemen under the
age of thirty dwelling within fifteen miles of the habitation of that
peerless Oriana

And all prenticeboys too cried Amyas out of the pasty

And all prenticeboys The bold lads shall fight first with good
quarterstaves in Bideford Market till all heads are broken and the
head which is not broken let the back belonging to it pay the penalty
of the noble members cowardice After which grand tournament to which
that of Tottenham shall be but a fleabite and a batrachomyomachy

Confound you and your long words sir said poor Will I know you
are flouting me

Pazienza Signor Cavaliere that which is to come is no flouting but
bloody and warlike earnest For afterwards all the young gentlemen
shall adjourn into a convenient field sand or bogwhich last will be
better as no man will be able to run away if he be up to his knees
in soft peat and there stripping to our shirts with rapiers of equal
length and keenest temper each shall slay his man catch who catch can
and the conquerors fight again like a most valiant main of gamecocks
as we are till all be dead and out of their woes after which the
survivor bewailing before heaven and earth the cruelty of our Fair
Oriana and the slaughter which her basiliscine eyes have caused shall
fall gracefully upon his sword and so end the woes of this our lovelorn
generation Placetne Domini as they used to ask in the Senate at
Oxford

Really said Cary this is too bad

So is pardon me your fighting Mr Coffin with anything longer than a
bodkin

Bodkins are too short for such fierce Bobadils said Amyas they
would close in so near that we should have them falling to fisticuffs
after the first bout

Then let them fight with squirts across the marketplace for by heaven
and the queens laws they shall fight with nothing else

My dear Mr Cary went on Frank suddenly changing his bantering tone
to one of the most winning sweetness do not fancy that I cannot feel
for you or that I as well as you have not known the stings of love
and the bitterer stings of jealousy But oh Mr Cary does it not seem
to you an awful thing to waste selfishly upon your own quarrel that
divine wrath which as Plato says is the very root of all virtues and
which has been given you like all else which you have that you may
spend it in the service of her whom all bad souls fear and all virtuous
souls adoreour peerless queen Who dares while she rules England
call his sword or his courage his own or any ones but hers Are there
no Spaniards to conquer no wild Irish to deliver from their oppressors
that two gentlemen of Devon can find no better place to flesh their
blades than in each others valiant and honorable hearts

By heaven cried Amyas Frank speaks like a book and for me I do
think that Christian gentlemen may leave love quarrels to bulls and
rams

And that the heir of Clovelly said Frank smiling may find more
noble examples to copy than the stags in his own deerpark

Well said Will penitently you are a great scholar Mr Frank and
you speak like one but gentlemen must fight sometimes or where would
be their honor

I speak said Frank a little proudly not merely as a scholar
but as a gentleman and one who has fought ere now and to whom it has
happened Mr Cary to kill his man on whose soul may God have mercy
but it is my pride to remember that I have never yet fought in my own
quarrel and my trust in God that I never shall For as there is nothing
more noble and blessed than to fight in behalf of those whom we love
so to fight in our own private behalf is a thing not to be allowed to a
Christian man unless refusal imports utter loss of life or honor
and even then it may be though I would not lay a burden on any mans
conscience it is better not to resist evil but to overcome it with
good

And I can tell you Will said Amyas I am not troubled with fear of
ghosts but when I cut off the Frenchmans head I said to myself If
that braggart had been slandering me instead of her gracious majesty I
should expect to see that head lying on my pillow every time I went to
bed at night

God forbid said Will with a shudder But what shall I do for to
the market tomorrow I will go if it were chokefull of Coffins and a
ghost in each coffin of the lot

Leave the matter to me said Amyas I have my device as well as
scholar Frank here and if there be as I suppose there must be a
quarrel in the market tomorrow see if I do not

Well you are two good fellows said Will Let us have another
tankard in

And drink the health of Mr Coffin and all gallant lads of the North
said Frank and now to my business I have to take this runaway youth
here home to his mother and if he will not go quietly I have orders to
carry him across my saddle

I hope your nag has a strong back then said Amyas but I must go on
and see Sir Richard Frank It is all very well to jest as we have been
doing but my mind is made up

Stop said Cary You must stay here tonight first for good
fellowships sake and next because I want the advice of our Phoenix
here our oracle our paragon There Mr Frank can you construe that
for me Speak low though gentlemen both there comes my father you
had better give me the letter again Well father whence this morning

Eh company here Young men you are always welcome and such as you
Would there were more of your sort in these dirty times How is your
good mother Frank eh Where have I been Will Round the housefarm
to look at the beeves That sheeted heifer of Prowses is all wrong
her coat stares like a hedgepigs Tell Jewell to go up and bring her in
before night And then up the forty acres sprang two coveys and picked
a leash out of them The Irish hawk flies as wild as any haggard still
and will never make a bird I had to hand her to Tom and take the
little peregrine Give me a Clovelly hawk against the world after
all andheigh ho I am very hungry Halfpast twelve and dinner not
served What Master Amyas spoiling your appetite with strong ale
Better have tried sack lad have some now with me

And the worthy old gentleman having finished his oration settled
himself on a great bench inside the chimney and put his hawk on a perch
over his head while his cockers coiled themselves up close to the warm
peatashes and his son set to work to pull off his fathers boots amid
sundry warnings to take care of his corns

Come Master Amyas a pint of white wine and sugar and a bit of a
shoeinghorn to it ere we dine Some pickled prawns now or a rasher
off the coals to whet you

Thank you quoth Amyas but I have drunk a mort of outlandish
liquors better and worse in the last three years and yet never found
aught to come up to good ale which needs neither shoeinghorn before
nor after but takes care of itself and of all honest stomachs too I
think

You speak like a book boy said old Cary and after all what a
plague comes of these newfangled hot wines and aqua vitaes which have
come in since the wars but maddening of the brains and fever of the
blood

I fear we have not seen the end of that yet said Frank My friends
write me from the Netherlands that our men are falling into a swinish
trick of swilling like the Hollanders Heaven grant that they may not
bring home the fashion with them

A man must drink they say or die of the ague in those vile swamps
said Amyas When they get home here they will not need it

Heaven grant it said Frank I should be sorry to see Devonshire
a drunken county and there are many of our men out there with Mr
Champernoun

Ah said Cary there as in Ireland we are proving her majestys
saying true that Devonshire is her right hand and the young children
thereof like the arrows in the hand of the giant

They may well be said his son when some of them are giants
themselves like my tall schoolfellow opposite

He will be up and doing again presently Ill warrant him said old
Cary

And that I shall quoth Amyas I have been devising brave deeds
and see in the distance enchanters to be bound dragons choked empires
conquered though not in Holland

You do asked Will a little sharply for he had had a half suspicion
that more was meant than met the ear

Yes said Amyas turning off his jest again I go to what Raleigh
calls the Land of the Nymphs Another month I hope will see me abroad
in Ireland

Abroad Call it rather at home said old Cary for it is full of
Devon men from end to end and you will be among friends all day long
George Bourchier from Tawstock has the army now in Munster and Warham
St Leger is marshal George Carew is with Lord Grey of Wilton Poor
Peter Carew was killed at Glendalough and after the defeat last year
when that villain Desmond cut off Herbert and Price the companies were
made up with six hundred Devon men and Arthur Fortescue at their head
so that the old county holds her head as proudly in the Land of Ire as
she does in the Low Countries and the Spanish Main

And where asked Amyas is Davils of Marsland who used to teach me
how to catch trout when I was staying down at Stow He is in Ireland
too is he not

Ah my lad said Mr Cary that is a sad story I thought all England
had known it

You forget sir I am a stranger Surely he is not dead

Murdered foully lad Murdered like a dog and by the man whom he had
treated as his son and who pretended the false knave to call him
father

His blood is avenged said Amyas fiercely

No by heaven not yet Stay dont cry out again I am getting
oldI must tell my story my own way It was last Julywas it not
WillOver comes to Ireland Saunders one of those Jesuit foxes as the
Popes legate with money and bulls and a banner hallowed by the Pope
and the devil knows what beside and with him James Fitzmaurice the
same fellow who had sworn on his knees to Perrott in the church at
Kilmallock to be a true liegeman to Queen Elizabeth and confirmed it
by all his saints and such a world of his Irish howling that Perrott
told me he was fain to stop his own ears Well he had been practising
with the King of France but got nothing but laughter for his pains and
so went over to the Most Catholic King and promises him to join Ireland
to Spain and set up Popery again and what not And he I suppose
thinking it better that Ireland should belong to him than to the Popes
bastard fits him out and sends him off on such another errand as
Stukelysthough I will say for the honor of Devon if Stukely lived
like a fool he died like an honest man

Sir Thomas Stukely dead too said Amyas

Wait a while lad and you shall have that tragedy afterwards Well
where was I Oh Fitzmaurice and the Jesuits land at Smerwick with
three ships choose a place for a fort bless it with their holy water
and their moppings and their scourings and the rest of it to purify
it from the stain of heretic dominion but in the meanwhile one of
the Courtenaysa Courtenay of Haccombe was itor a Courtenay of
Boconnock Silence Will I shall have it in a minuteyes a Courtenay
of Haccombe it was lying at anchor near by in a ship of war of his
cuts out the three ships and cuts off the Dons from the sea John and
James Desmond with some small rabble go over to the Spaniards Earl
Desmond will not join them but will not fight them and stands by to
take the winning side and then in comes poor Davils sent down by the
Lord Deputy to charge Desmond and his brothers in the queens name to
assault the Spaniards Folks say it was rash of his lordship but I
say what could be better done Every one knows that there never was a
stouter or shrewder soldier than Davils and the young Desmonds I have
heard him say many a time used to look on him as their father But
he found out what it was to trust Englishmen turned Irish Well
the Desmonds found out on a sudden that the Dons were such desperate
Paladins that it was madness to meddle though they were five to one
and poor Davils seeing that there was no fight in them goes back for
help and sleeps that night at some place called Tralee Arthur Carter
of Bideford St Legers lieutenant as stout an old soldier as Davils
himself sleeps in the same bed with him the lacqueyboy who is now
with Sir Richard at Stow on the floor at their feet But in the dead of
night who should come in but James Desmond sword in hand with a dozen
of his ruffians at his heels each with his glib over his ugly face
and his skene in his hand Davils springs up in bed and asks but this
What is the matter my son whereon the treacherous villain without
giving him time to say a prayer strikes at him naked as he was
crying Thou shalt be my father no longer nor I thy son Thou shalt
die and at that all the rest fall on him The poor little lad so he
says leaps up to cover his master with his naked body gets three or
four stabs of skenes and so falls for dead with his master and Captain
Carter who were dead indeedGod reward them After that the ruffians
ransacked the house till they had murdered every Englishman in it the
lacqueyboy only excepted who crawled out wounded as he was through
a window while Desmond if you will believe it went back up to his
elbows in blood and vaunted his deeds to the Spaniards and asked
themThere Will you take that as a pledge that I am faithful to you
And that my lad was the end of Henry Davils and will be of all who
trust to the faith of wild savages

I would go a hundred miles to see that Desmond hanged said Amyas
while great tears ran down his face Poor Mr Davils And now what is
the story of Sir Thomas

Your brother must tell you that lad I am somewhat out of breath

And I have a right to tell it said Frank with a smile Do you know
that I was very near being Earl of the bog of Allen and one of the
peers of the realm to King Buoncompagna son and heir to his holiness
Pope Gregory the Thirteenth

No surely

As I am a gentleman When I was at Rome I saw poor Stukely often and
this and more he offered me on the part as he said of the Pope if I
would just oblige him in the two little matters of being reconciled to
the Catholic Church and joining the invasion of Ireland

Poor deluded heretic said Will Cary to have lost an earldom for
your family by such silly scruples of loyalty

It is not a matter for jesting after all said Frank but I saw Sir
Thomas often and I cannot believe he was in his senses so frantic was
his vanity and his ambition and all the while in private matters as
honorable a gentleman as ever However he sailed at last for Ireland
with his eight hundred Spaniards and Italians and what is more I
know that the King of Spain paid their charges Marquis VinolaJames
Buoncompagna that isstayed quietly at Rome preferring that Stukely
should conquer his paternal heritage of Ireland for him while he took
care of the bona robas at home I went down to Civita Vecchia to see
him off and though his younger by many years I could not but take
the liberty of entreating him as a gentleman and a man of Devon to
consider his faith to his queen and the honor of his country There were
high words between us God forgive me if I spoke too fiercely for I
never saw him again

Too fiercely to an open traitor Frank Why not have run him through

Nay I had no clean life for Sundays Amyas so I could not throw away
my weekday one and as for the weal of England I knew that it was
little he would damage it and told him so And at that he waxed utterly
mad for it touched his pride and swore that if the wind had not been
fair for sailing he would have fought me there and then to which I
could only answer that I was ready to meet him when he would and he
parted from me saying It is a pity sir I cannot fight you now when
next we meet it will be beneath my dignity to measure swords with you

I suppose he expected to come back a prince at leastHeaven knows I
owe him no illwill nor I hope does any man He has paid all debts now
in full and got his receipt for them

How did he die then after all

On his voyage he touched in Portugal King Sebastian was just sailing
for Africa with his new ally Mohammed the Prince of Fez to help King
Abdallah and conquer what he could He persuaded Stukely to go with
him There were those who thought that he as well as the Spaniards had
no stomach for seeing the Popes son King of Ireland Others used to
say that he thought an island too small for his ambition and must needs
conquer a continentI know not why it was but he went They had heavy
weather in the passage and when they landed many of their soldiers
were seasick Stukely reasonably enough counselled that they should
wait two or three days and recruit but Don Sebastian was so mad for the
assault that he must needs have his veni vidi vici and so ended with
a veni vidi perii for he Abdallah and his son Mohammed all perished
in the first battle at Alcasar and Stukely surrounded and overpowered
fought till he could fight no more and then died like a hero with all
his wounds in front and may God have mercy on his soul

Ah said Amyas we heard of that battle off Lima but nothing about
poor Stukely

That last was a Popish prayer Master Frank said old Mr Cary

Most worshipful sir you surely would not wish God not to have mercy on
his soul

Noeh Of course not but thats all settled by now for he is dead
poor fellow

Certainly my dear sir And you cannot help being a little fond of him
still

Eh why I should be a brute if I were not He and I were
schoolfellows though he was somewhat the younger and many a good
thrashing have I given him and one cannot help having a tenderness for
a man after that Beside we used to hunt together in Exmoor and have
royal nights afterward into Ilfracombe when we were a couple of mad
young blades Fond of him Why I would have sooner given my forefinger
than that he should have gone to the dogs thus

Then my dear sir if you feel for him still in spite of all his
faults how do you know that God may not feel for him still in spite of
all his faults For my part quoth Frank in his fanciful way without
believing in that Popish Purgatory I cannot help holding with Plato
that such heroical souls who have wanted but little of true greatness
are hereafter by some strait discipline brought to a better mind
perhaps as many ancients have held with the Indian Gymnosophists by
transmigration into the bodies of those animals whom they have resembled
in their passions and indeed if Sir Thomas Stukelys soul should now
animate the body of a lion all I can say is that he would be a very
valiant and royal lion and also doubtless become in due time heartily
ashamed and penitent for having been nothing better than a lion

What now Master Frank I dont trouble my head with such mattersI
say Stukely was a right goodhearted fellow at bottom and if you plague
my head with any of your dialectics and propositions and college quips
and quiddities you shant have any more sack sir But here come the
knaves and I hear the cook knock to dinner

After a madrigal or two and an Italian song of Master Franks all
which went sweetly enough the ladies rose and went Whereon Will Cary
drawing his chair close to Franks put quietly into his hand a dirty
letter

This was the letter left for me whispered he by a country fellow
this morning Look at it and tell me what I am to do

Whereon Frank opened and read

 Mister Cary be you wary
 By deer park end tonight
 Yf Irish ffoxe com out of rocks
 Grip and hold hym tight

I would have showed it my father said Will but

I verily believe it to be a blind See now this is the handwriting of
a man who has been trying to write vilely and yet cannot Look at
that B and that G their formae formativae never were begotten in a
hedgeschool And what is more this is no Devon mans handiwork We say
to and not by Will eh in the West country

Of course

And man instead of him

True O Daniel But am I to do nothing therefore

On that matter I am no judge Let us ask muchenduring Ulysses here
perhaps he has not sailed round the world without bringing home a device
or two

Whereon Amyas was called to counsel as soon as Mr Cary could be
stopped in a long crossexamination of him as to Mr Doughtys famous
trial and execution

Amyas pondered awhile thrusting his hands into his long curls and
then

Will my lad have you been watching at the Deer Park End of late

Never

Where then

At the townbeach

Where else

At the townhead

Where else

Why the fellow is turned lawyer Above Freshwater

Where is Freshwater

Why where the waterfall comes over the cliff halfamile from the
town There is a path there up into the forest

I know Ill watch there tonight Do you keep all your old haunts
safe of course and send a couple of stout knaves to the mill to watch
the beach at the Deer Park End on the chance for your poet may be a
true man after all But my hearts faith is that this comes just to
draw you off from some old beat of yours upon a wildgoose chase If
they shoot the miller by mistake I suppose it dont much matter

Marry no

 When a millers knockd on the head
 The less of flour makes the more of bread

Or again chimed in old Mr Cary as they say in the North

 Find a miller that will not steal
 Or a webster that is leal
 Or a priest that is not greedy
 And lay them three a dead corpse by
 And by the virtue of them three
 The said dead corpse shall quickend be

But why are you so ready to watch Freshwater tonight Master Amyas

Because sir those who come if they come will never land at
Mouthmill if they are strangers they dare not and if they are
baysmen they are too wise as long as the westerly swell sets in As
for landing at the town that would be too great a risk but Freshwater
is as lonely as the Bermudas and they can beach a boat up under the
cliff at all tides and in all weathers except north and norwest I
have done it many a time when I was a boy

And give us the fruit of your experience now in your old age eh Well
you have a gray head on green shoulders my lad and I verily believe
you are right Who will you take with you to watch

Sir said Frank I will go with my brother and that will be enough

Enough He is big enough and you brave enough for ten but still the
more the merrier

But the fewer the better fare If I might ask a first and last favor
worshipful sir said Frank very earnestly you would grant me two
things that you would let none go to Freshwater but me and my brother
and that whatsoever we shall bring you back shall be kept as secret as
the commonweal and your loyalty shall permit I trust that we are not so
unknown to you or to others that you can doubt for a moment but that
whatsoever we may do will satisfy at once your honor and our own

My dear young gentleman there is no need of so many courtiers words
I am your fathers friend and yours And God forbid that a Caryfor I
guess your driftshould ever wish to make a head or a heart ache that
is more than

Those of whom it is written Though thou bray a fool in a mortar yet
will not his folly depart from him interposed Frank in so sad a tone
that no one at the table replied and few more words were exchanged
till the two brothers were safe outside the house and then

Amyas said Frank that was a Devon mans handiwork nevertheless it
was Eustaces handwriting

Impossible

No lad I have been secretary to a prince and learnt to interpret
cipher and to watch every penstroke and young as I am I think that
I am not easily deceived Would God I were Come on lad and strike no
man hastily lest thou cut off thine own flesh

So forth the two went along the park to the eastward and past the
head of the little woodembosomed fishingtown a steep stair of houses
clinging to the cliff far below them the bright slate roofs and white
walls glittering in the moonlight and on some halfmile farther along
the steep hillside fenced with oak wood down to the waters edge by
a narrow forest path to a point where two glens meet and pour their
streamlets over a cascade some hundred feet in height into the sea
below By the side of this waterfall a narrow path climbs upward from
the beach and here it was that the two brothers expected to meet the
messenger

Frank insisted on taking his station below Amyas He said that he was
certain that Eustace himself would make his appearance and that he
was more fit than Amyas to bring him to reason by parley that if Amyas
would keep watch some twenty yards above the escape of the messenger
would be impossible Moreover he was the elder brother and the post of
honor was his right So Amyas obeyed him after making him promise that
if more than one man came up the path he would let them pass him before
he challenged so that both might bring them to bay at the same time

So Amyas took his station under a high marl bank and bedded in
luxuriant crownferns kept his eye steadily on Frank who sat down on
a little knoll of rock where is now a garden on the cliffedge which
parts the path and the dark chasm down which the stream rushes to its
final leap over the cliff

There Amyas sat a full halfhour and glanced at whiles from Frank to
look upon the scene around Outside the southwest wind blew fresh and
strong and the moonlight danced upon a thousand crests of foam but
within the black jagged point which sheltered the town the sea did
but heave in long oily swells of rolling silver onward into the black
shadow of the hills within which the town and pier lay invisible
save where a twinkling light gave token of some lonely fishers wife
watching the weary night through for the boat which would return with
dawn Here and there upon the sea a black speck marked a herringboat
drifting with its line of nets and right off the mouth of the
glen Amyas saw with a beating heart a large twomasted vessel
lyingtothat must be the Portugal Eagerly he looked up the glen
and listened but he heard nothing but the sweeping of the wind across
the downs five hundred feet above and the sough of the waterfall upon
the rocks below he saw nothing but the vast black sheets of oakwood
sloping up to the narrow blue sky above and the broad bright hunters
moon and the woodcocks which chuckling to each other hawked to and
fro like swallows between the treetops and the sky

At last he heard a rustle of the fallen leaves he shrank closer and
closer into the darkness of the bank Then swift light stepsnot down
the path from above but upward from below his heart beat quick and
loud And in another halfminute a man came in sight within three yards
of Franks hidingplace

Frank sprang out instantly Amyas saw his bright blade glance in the
clear October moonlight

Stand in the queens name

The man drew a pistol from under his cloak and fired full in his face
Had it happened in these days of detonators Franks chance had been
small but to get a ponderous wheellock under weigh was a longer
business and before the fizzing of the flint had ceased Frank had
struck up the pistol with his rapier and it exploded harmlessly over
his head The man instantly dashed the weapon in his face and closed

The blow luckily did not take effect on that delicate forehead but
struck him on the shoulder nevertheless Frank who with all his grace
and agility was as fragile as a lily and a very bubble of the earth
staggered and lost his guard and before he could recover himself
Amyas saw a dagger gleam and one two three blows fiercely repeated

Mad with fury he was with them in an instant They were scuffling
together so closely in the shade that he was afraid to use his sword
point but with the hilt he dealt a single blow full on the ruffians
cheek It was enough with a hideous shriek the fellow rolled over at
his feet and Amyas set his foot on him in act to run him through

Stop stay almost screamed Frank it is Eustace our cousin
Eustace and he leant against a tree

Amyas sprang towards him but Frank waved him off

It is nothinga scratch He has papers I am sure of it Take them
and for Gods sake let him go

Villain give me your papers cried Amyas setting his foot once more
on the writhing Eustace whose jaw was broken across

You struck me foully from behind moaned he his vanity and envy even
then coming out in that faint and foolish attempt to prove Amyas not so
very much better a man

Hound do you think that I dare not strike you in front Give me your
papers letters whatever Popish devilry you carry or as I live I will
cut off your head and take them myself even if it cost me the shame
of stripping your corpse Give them up Traitor murderer give them I
say And setting his foot on him afresh he raised his sword

Eustace was usually no craven but he was cowed Between agony and
shame he had no heart to resist Martyrdom which looked so splendid
when consummated selon les regles on Tower Hill or Tyburn before
pitying or still better scoffing multitudes looked a confused
dirty ugly business there in the dark forest and as he lay a stream
of moonlight bathed his mighty cousins broad clear forehead and his
long golden locks and his white terrible blade till he seemed to
Eustaces superstitious eye like one of those fair young St Michaels
trampling on the fiend which he had seen abroad in old German pictures
He shuddered pulled a packet from his bosom and threw it from him
murmuring I have not given it

Swear to me that these are all the papers which you have in cipher or
out of cipher Swear on your soul or you die

Eustace swore

Tell me who are your accomplices

Never said Eustace Cruel have you not degraded me enough already
and the wretched young man burst into tears and hid his bleeding face
in his hands

One hint of honor made Amyas as gentle as a lamb He lifted Eustace up
and bade him run for his life

I am to owe my life then to you

Not in the least only to your being a Leigh Go or it will be worse
for you And Eustace went while Amyas catching up the precious
packet hurried to Frank He had fainted already and his brother had
to carry him as far as the park before he could find any of the other
watchers The blind as far as they were concerned was complete They
had heard and seen nothing Whosoever had brought the packet had landed
they knew not where and so all returned to the court carrying Frank
who recovered gradually having rather bruises than wounds for his foe
had struck wildly and with a trembling hand

Halfanhour after Amyas Mr Cary and his son Will were in deep
consultation over the following epistle the only paper in the packet
which was not in cipher


DEAR BROTHER N S in Chto et Ecclesia

This is to inform you and the friends of the cause that S Josephus
has landed in Smerwick with eight hundred valiant Crusaders burning
with holy zeal to imitate last years martyrs of Carrigfolium and
to expiate their offences which I fear may have been many by the
propagation of our most holy faith I have purified the fort which they
are strenuously rebuilding with prayer and holy water from the stain
of heretical footsteps and consecrated it afresh to the service of
Heaven as the firstfruits of the isle of saints and having displayed
the consecrated banner to the adoration of the faithful have returned
to Earl Desmond that I may establish his faith weak as yet by reason
of the allurements of this world though since by the valor of his
brother James he that hindered was taken out of the way I mean Davils
the heretic sacrifice wellpleasing in the eyes of Heaven the young
man has lent a more obedient ear to my counsels If you can do anything
do it quickly for a great door and effectual is opened and there are
many adversaries But be swift for so do the poor lambs of the Church
tremble at the fury of the heretics that a hundred will flee before one
Englishman And indeed were it not for that divine charity toward
the Church which covers the multitude of sins with which they are
resplendent neither they nor their country would be by the carnal
judgment counted worthy of so great labor in their behalf For they
themselves are given much to lying theft and drunkenness vain
babbling and profane dancing and singing and are still as S Gildas
reports of them more careful to shroud their villainous faces in bushy
hair than decently to cover their bodies while their land by
reason of the tyranny of their chieftains and the continual wars and
plunderings among their tribes which leave them weak and divided
an easy prey to the myrmidons of the excommunicate and usurping
Englishwoman lies utterly waste with fire and defaced with corpses of
the starved and slain But what are these things while the holy virtue
of Catholic obedience still flourishes in their hearts The Church cares
not for the conservation of body and goods but of immortal souls

If any devout lady shall so will you may obtain from her liberality a
shirt for this worthless tabernacle and also a pair of hose for I am
unsavory to myself and to others and of such luxuries none here has
superfluity for all live in holy poverty except the fleas who have
that consolation in this world for which this unhappy nation and those
who labor among them must wait till the world to come

Your loving brother

  See note at end of chapter

Sir Richard must know of this before daybreak cried old Cary Eight
hundred men landed We must call out the Posse Comitatus and sail with
them bodily I will go myself old as I am Spaniards in Ireland not a
dog of them must go home again

Not a dog of them answered Will but where is Mr Winter and his
squadron

Safe in Milford Haven a messenger must be sent to him too

Ill go said Amyas but Mr Cary is right Sir Richard must know all
first

And we must have those Jesuits

What Mr Evans and Mr Morgans God help usthey are at my uncles
Consider the honor of our family

Judge for yourself my dear boy said old Mr Cary gently would
it not be rank treason to let these foxes escape while we have this
damning proof against them

I will go myself then

Why not You may keep all straight and Will shall go with you Call a
groom Will and get your horse saddled and my Yorkshire gray he will
make better play with this big fellow on his back than the little pony
astride of which Mr Leigh came walking in as I hear this morning As
for Frank the ladies will see to him well enough and glad enough too
to have so fine a bird in their cage for a week or two

And my mother

Well send to her tomorrow by daybreak Come a stirrup cup to start
with hot and hot Now boots cloaks swords a deep pull and a warm
one and away

And the jolly old man bustled them out of the house and into their
saddles under the broad bright winters moon

You must make your pace lads or the moon will be down before you are
over the moors And so away they went

Neither of them spoke for many a mile Amyas because his mind was fixed
firmly on the one object of saving the honor of his house and Will
because he was hesitating between Ireland and the wars and Rose
Salterne and lovemaking At last he spoke suddenly

Ill go Amyas

Whither

To Ireland with you old man I have dragged my anchor at last

What anchor my lad of parables

See here am I a tall and gallant ship

Modest even if not true

Inclination like an anchor holds me tight

To the mud

Nay to a bed of rosesnot without their thorns

Hillo I have seen oysters grow on fruittrees before now but never an
anchor in a rosegarden

Silence or my allegory will go to nogginstaves

Against the rocks of my flinty discernment

Poohwell Up comes duty like a jolly breeze blowing dead from the
northeast and as bitter and cross as a northeaster too and tugs
me away toward Ireland I hold on by the rosebedany ground in a
stormtill every strand is parted and off I go westward ho to get my
throat cut in a boghole with Amyas Leigh

Earnest Will

As I am a sinful man

Well done young hawk of the White Cliff

I had rather have called it Gallantry Bower still though said
Will punning on the double name of the noble precipice which forms the
highest point of the deer park

Well as long as you are on land you know it is Gallantry Bower still
but we always call it White Cliff when you see it from the seaboard as
you and I shall do I hope tomorrow evening

What so soon

Dare we lose a day

I suppose not heighho

And they rode on again in silence Amyas in the meanwhile being not a
little content in spite of his late selfrenunciation to find that one
of his rivals at least was going to raise the siege of the Rose garden
for a few months and withdraw his forces to the coast of Kerry

As they went over Bursdon Amyas pulled up suddenly

Did you not hear a horses step on our left

On our leftcoming up from Welsford moor Impossible at this time of
night It must have been a stag or a sownder of wild swine or may be
only an old cow

It was the ring of iron friend Let us stand and watch

Bursdon and Welsford were then as now a rolling range of dreary
moors unbroken by tor or tree or anything save few and far between
a worldold furzebank which marked the common rights of some distant
cattle farm and crossed then not as now by a decent road but by a
rough confused trackway the remnant of an old Roman road from Clovelly
dikes to Launceston To the left it trended down towards a lower range
of moors which form the watershed of the heads of Torridge and thither
the two young men peered down over the expanse of bog and furze which
glittered for miles beneath the moon one sheet of frosted silver in
the heavy autumn dew

If any of Eustaces party are trying to get home from Freshwater they
might save a couple of miles by coming across Welsford instead of going
by the main track as we have done So said Amyas who though luckily
for him no genius was cunning as a fox in all matters of tactic and
practic and would have in these days proved his right to be considered
an intellectual person by being a thorough man of business

If any of his party are mad theyll try it and be stogged till the
day of judgment There are bogs in the bottom twenty feet deep Plague
on the fellow whoever he is he has dodged us Look there

It was too true The unknown horseman had evidently dismounted below
and led his horse up on the other side of a long furzedike till coming
to the point where it turned away again from his intended course he
appeared against the sky in the act of leading his nag over a gap

Ride like the wind and both youths galloped across furze and heather
at him but ere they were within a hundred yards of him he had leapt
again on his horse and was away far ahead

There is the dor to us with a vengeance cried Cary putting in the
spurs

It is but a lad we shall never catch him

Ill try though and do you lumber after as you can old heavysides
and Cary pushed forward

Amyas lost sight of him for ten minutes and then came up with him
dismounted and feeling disconsolately at his horses knees

Look for my head It lies somewhere about among the furze there and
oh I am as full of needles as ever was a pincushion

Are his knees broken

I darent look No I believe not Come along and make the best of a
bad matter The fellow is a mile ahead and to the right too

He is going for Moorwinstow then but where is my cousin

Behind us I dare say We shall nab him at least

Cary promise me that if we do you will keep out of sight and let me
manage him

My boy I only want Evan Morgans and Morgan Evans He is but the cats
paw and we are after the cats themselves

And so they went on another dreary six miles till the land trended
downwards showing dark glens and masses of woodland far below

Now then straight to Chapel and stop the foxes earth Or through
the Kings Park to Stow and get out Sir Richards hounds hue and cry
and queens warrant in proper form

Let us see Sir Richard first and whatsoever he decides about my uncle
I will endure as a loyal subject must

So they rode through the Kings Park while Sir Richards colts came
whinnying and staring round the intruders and down through a rich
woodland lane five hundred feet into the valley till they could hear
the brawling of the little troutstream and beyond the everlasting
thunder of the ocean surf

Down through warm woods all fragrant with dying autumn flowers leaving
far above the keen Atlantic breeze into one of those delicious Western
combes and so past the mill and the little knot of flowerclad
cottages In the window of one of them a light was still burning The
two young men knew well whose window that was and both hearts beat
fast for Rose Salterne slept or rather seemed to wake in that
chamber

Folks are late in Combe tonight said Amyas as carelessly as he
could

Cary looked earnestly at the window and then sharply enough at Amyas
but Amyas was busy settling his stirrup and Cary rode on unconscious
that every fibre in his companions huge frame was trembling like his
own

Muggy and close down here said Amyas who in reality was quite
faint with his own inward struggles

We shall be at Stow gate in five minutes said Cary looking back and
down longingly as his horse climbed the opposite hill but a turn of the
zigzag road hid the cottage and the next thought was how to effect an
entrance into Stow at three in the morning without being eaten by the
bandogs who were already howling and growling at the sound of the
horsehoofs

However they got safely in after much knocking and calling through
the postern gate in the high west wall into a mansion the description
whereof I must defer to the next chapter seeing that the moon has
already sunk into the Atlantic and there is darkness over land and sea

Sir Richard in his long gown was soon downstairs in the hall the
letter read and the story told but ere it was half finished

Anthony call up a groom and let him bring me a horse round
Gentlemen if you will excuse me five minutes I shall be at your
service

You will not go alone Richard asked Lady Grenville putting her
beautiful face in its nightcoif out of an adjoining door

Surely sweet chuck we three are enough to take two poor polecats of
Jesuits Go in and help me to boot and gird

In half an hour they were down and up across the valley again under the
few low ashes clipt flat by the seabreeze which stood round the lonely
gate of Chapel

Mr Cary there is a back path across the downs to Marsland go and
guard that Cary rode off and Sir Richard as he knocked loudly at the
gate

Mr Leigh you see that I have consulted your honor and that of your
poor uncle by adventuring thus alone What will you have me do now
which may not be unfit for me and you

Oh sir said Amyas with tears in his honest eyes you have shown
yourself once more what you always have beenmy dear and beloved master
on earth not second even to my admiral Sir Francis Drake

Or the queen I hope said Grenville smiling but pocas palabras
What will you do

My wretched cousin sir may not have returnedand if I might watch
for him on the main roadunless you want me with you

Richard Grenville can walk alone lad But what will you do with your
cousin

Send him out of the country never to return or if he refuses run him
through on the spot

Go lad And as he spoke a sleepy voice asked inside the gate Who
was there

Sir Richard Grenville Open in the queens name

Sir Richard He is in bed and be hanged to you No honest folk come at
this hour of night

Amyas shouted Sir Richard Amyas rode back

Burst that gate for me while I hold your horse

Amyas leaped down took up a rock from the roadside such as Homers
heroes used to send at each others heads and in an instant the door
was flat on the ground and the servingman on his back inside while
Sir Richard quietly entering over it like Una into the hut told the
fellow to get up and hold his horse for him which the clod who knew
well enough that terrible voice did without further murmurs and then
strode straight to the front door It was already opened The household
had been up and about all along or the noise at the entry had aroused
them

Sir Richard knocked however at the open door and to his
astonishment his knock was answered by Mr Leigh himself fully
dressed and candle in hand

Sir Richard Grenville What sir is this neighborly not to say
gentle to break into my house in the dead of night

I broke your outer door sir because I was refused entrance when I
asked in the queens name I knocked at your inner one as I should
have knocked at the poorest cottagers in the parish because I found
it open You have two Jesuits here sir and here is the queens warrant
for apprehending them I have signed it with my own hand and moreover
serve it now with my own hand in order to save you scandaland it may
be worse I must have these men Mr Leigh

My dear Sir Richard

I must have them or I must search the house and you would not put
either yourself or me to so shameful a necessity

My dear Sir Richard

Must I then ask you to stand back from your own doorway my dear
sir said Grenville And then changing his voice to that fearful lions
roar for which he was famous and which it seemed impossible that lips
so delicate could utter he thundered Knaves behind there Back

This was spoken to halfadozen grooms and servingmen who well armed
were clustered in the passage

What swords out you sons of cliff rabbits And in a moment Sir
Richards long blade flashed out also and putting Mr Leigh gently
aside as if he had been a child he walked up to the party who
vanished right and left having expected a cur dog in the shape of a
parish constable and come upon a lion instead They were stout fellows
enough no doubt in a fair fight but they had no stomach to be hanged
in a row at Launceston Castle after a preliminary running through the
body by that redoubted admiral and most unpeaceful justice of the peace

And now my dear Mr Leigh said Sir Richard as blandly as ever
where are my men The night is cold and you as well as I need to be
in our beds

The men Sir Richardthe Jesuitsthey are not here indeed

Not here sir

On the word of a gentleman they left my house an hour ago Believe me
sir they did I will swear to you if you need

I believe Mr Leigh of Chapels word without oaths Whither are they
gone

Nay sirhow can I tell They arethey are as I may say fled sir
escaped

With your connivance at least with your sons Where are they gone

As I live I do not know

Mr Leighis this possible Can you add untruth to that treason from
the punishment of which I am trying to shield you

Poor Mr Leigh burst into tears

Oh my God my God is it come to this Over and above having the fear
and anxiety of keeping these black rascals in my house and having to
stop their villainous mouths every minute for fear they should hang me
and themselves I am to be called a traitor and a liar in my old age
and that too by Richard Grenville Would God I had never been born
Would God I had no soul to be saved and Id just go and drown care in
drink and let the queen and the Pope fight it out their own way And
the poor old man sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands
and then leaped up again

Bless my heart Excuse me Sir Richardto sit down and leave you
standing S life sir sorrow is making a hawbuck of me Sit down my
dear sir my worshipful sir or rather come with me into my room and
hear a poor wretched mans story for I swear before God the men are
fled and my poor boy Eustace is not home either and the groom tells me
that his devil of a cousin has broken his jaw for him and his mother is
all but mad this hour past Good lack good lack

He nearly murdered his angel of a cousin sir said Sir Richard
severely

What sir They never told me

He had stabbed his cousin Frank three times sir before Amyas who is
as noble a lad as walks Gods earth struck him down And in defence
of what forsooth did he play the ruffian and the swashbuckler but to
bring home to your house this letter sir which you shall hear at your
leisure the moment I have taken order about your priests And walking
out of the house he went round and called to Cary to come to him

The birds are flown Will whispered he There is but one chance for
us and that is Marsland Mouth If they are trying to take boat there
you may be yet in time If they are gone inland we can do nothing till
we raise the hue and cry tomorrow

And Will galloped off over the downs toward Marsland while Sir Richard
ceremoniously walked in again and professed himself ready and happy to
have the honor of an audience in Mr Leighs private chamber And as we
know pretty well already what was to be discussed therein we had better
go over to Marsland Mouth and if possible arrive there before Will
Cary seeing that he arrived hot and swearing half an hour too late


NoteI have shrunk somewhat from giving these and other sketches true
and accurate as I believe them to be of Ireland during Elizabeths
reign when the tyranny and lawlessness of the feudal chiefs had reduced
the island to such a state of weakness and barbarism that it was
absolutely necessary for England either to crush the NormanIrish
nobility and organize some sort of law and order or to leave Ireland
an easy prey to the Spaniards or any other nation which should go to
war with us The work was doneclumsily rather than cruelly but wrongs
were inflicted and avenged by fresh wrongs and those by fresh again
May the memory of them perish forever It has been reserved for this
age and for the liberal policy of this age to see the last ebullitions
of Celtic excitability die out harmless and ashamed of itself and
to find that the Irishman when he is brought as a soldier under the
regenerative influence of law discipline selfrespect and loyalty
can prove himself a worthy rival of the more stern NorseSaxon warrior
God grant that the military brotherhood between Irish and English
which is the special glory of the present war may be the germ of a
brotherhood industrial political and hereafter perhaps religious
also and that not merely the corpses of heroes but the feuds and
wrongs which have parted them for centuries may lie buried once and
forever in the noble graves of Alma and Inkerman



CHAPTER VI

THE COMBES OF THE FAR WEST

 Far far from hence
 The Adriatic breaks in a warm bay
 Among the green Illyrian hills and there
 The sunshine in the happy glens is fair
 And by the sea and in the brakes
 The grass is cool the seaside air
 Buoyant and fresh the mountain flowers
 More virginal and sweet than ours

 MATTHEW ARNOLD

And even such are those delightful glens which cut the high tableland
of the confines of Devon and Cornwall and opening each through its
gorge of down and rock towards the boundless Western Ocean Each is
like the other and each is like no other English scenery Each has its
upright walls inland of rich oakwood nearer the sea of dark green
furze then of smooth turf then of weird black cliffs which range out
right and left far into the deep sea in castles spires and wings
of jagged ironstone Each has its narrow strip of fertile meadow its
crystal trout stream winding across and across from one hillfoot to the
other its gray stone mill with the water sparkling and humming round
the dripping wheel its dark rock pools above the tide mark where the
salmontrout gather in from their Atlantic wanderings after each autumn
flood its ridge of blown sand bright with golden trefoil and crimson
ladys finger its gray bank of polished pebbles down which the
stream rattles toward the sea below Each has its black field of jagged
sharkstooth rock which paves the cove from side to side streaked with
here and there a pink line of shell sand and laced with white foam from
the eternal surge stretching in parallel lines out to the westward
in strata set upright on edge or tilted towards each other at strange
angles by primeval earthquakessuch is the mouthas those coves are
called and such the jaw of teeth which they display one rasp of which
would grind abroad the timbers of the stoutest ship To landward
all richness softness and peace to seaward a waste and howling
wilderness of rock and roller barren to the fisherman and hopeless to
the shipwrecked mariner

In only one of these mouths is a landing for boats made possible by
a long seawall of rock which protects it from the rollers of the
Atlantic and that mouth is Marsland the abode of the White Witch Lucy
Passmore whither as Sir Richard Grenville rightly judged the Jesuits
were gone But before the Jesuits came two other persons were standing
on that lonely beach under the bright October moon namely Rose
Salterne and the White Witch herself for Rose fevered with curiosity
and superstition and allured by the very wildness and possible danger
of the spell had kept her appointment and a few minutes before
midnight stood on the gray shingle beach with her counsellor

You be safe enough here tonight miss My old man is snoring sound
abed and theres no other soul ever sets foot here o nights except
it be the mermaids now and then Goodness Father wheres our boat It
ought to be up here on the pebbles

Rose pointed to a strip of sand some forty yards nearer the sea where
the boat lay

Oh the lazy old villain hes been round the rocks after pollock this
evening and never taken the trouble to hale the boat up Ill trounce
him for it when I get home I only hope hes made her fast where she is
thats all Hes more plague to me than ever my money will be O deary
me

And the goodwife bustled down toward the boat with Rose behind her

Iss tis fast sure enough and the oars aboard too Well I never
Oh the lazy thief to leave they here to be stole Ill just sit in the
boat dear and watch mun while you go down to the say for you must
be all alone to yourself you know or youll see nothing Theres the
lookingglass now go and dip your head three times and mind you dont
look to land or sea before youve said the words and looked upon the
glass Now be quick its just upon midnight

And she coiled herself up in the boat while Rose went faltering down
the strip of sand some twenty yards farther and there slipping off her
clothes stood shivering and trembling for a moment before she entered
the sea

She was between two walls of rock that on her left hand some twenty
feet high hid her in deepest shade that on her right though much
lower took the whole blaze of the midnight moon Great festoons of live
and purple seaweed hung from it shading dark cracks and crevices fit
haunts for all the goblins of the sea On her left hand the peaks of
the rock frowned down ghastly black on her right hand far aloft the
downs slept bright and cold

The breeze had died away not even a roller broke the perfect stillness
of the cove The gulls were all asleep upon the ledges Over all was a
true autumn silence a silence which may be heard She stood awed and
listened in hope of a sound which might tell her that any living thing
beside herself existed

There was a faint bleat as of a newborn lamb high above her head
she started and looked up Then a wail from the cliffs as of a child
in pain answered by another from the opposite rocks They were but the
passing snipe and the otter calling to her brood but to her they
were mysterious supernatural goblins come to answer to her call
Nevertheless they only quickened her expectation and the witch had
told her not to fear them If she performed the rite duly nothing
would harm her but she could hear the beating of her own heart as she
stepped mirror in hand into the cold water waded hastily as far as
she dare and then stopped aghast

A ring of flame was round her waist every limb was bathed in lambent
light all the multitudinous life of the autumn sea stirred by her
approach had flashed suddenly into glory


And around her the lamps of the sea nymphs Myriad fiery globes swam
heaving and panting and rainbows Crimson and azure and emerald were
broken in starshowers lighting Far through the winedark depths of the
crystal the gardens of Nereus Coral and seafan and tangle the blooms
and the palms of the ocean


She could see every shell which crawled on the white sand at her feet
every rockfish which played in and out of the crannies and stared at
her with its broad bright eyes while the great palmate oarweeds which
waved along the chasm halfseen in the glimmering water seemed to
beckon her down with long brown hands to a grave amid their chilly
bowers She turned to flee but she had gone too far now to retreat
hastily dipping her head three times she hurried out to the seamarge
and looking through her dripping locks at the magic mirror pronounced
the incantation

 A maiden pure here I stand
 Neither on sea nor yet on land
 Angels watch me on either hand
 If you be landsman come down the strand
 If you be sailor come up the sand
 If you be angel come from the sky
 Look in my glass and pass me by
 Look in my glass and go from the shore
 Leave me but love me for evermore

The incantation was hardly finished her eyes were straining into the
mirror where as may be supposed nothing appeared but the sparkle of
the drops from her own tresses when she heard rattling down the pebbles
the hasty feet of men and horses

She darted into a cavern of the high rock and hastily dressed herself
the steps held on right to the boat Peeping out halfdead with terror
she saw there four men two of whom had just leaped from their horses
and turning them adrift began to help the other two in running the boat
down

Whereon out of the stern sheets arose like an angry ghost the portly
figure of Lucy Passmore and shrieked in shrillest treble

Eh ye villains ye roogs what do ye want staling poor folks boats by
night like this

The whole party recoiled in terror and one turned to run up the beach
shouting at the top of his voice Tis a marmaidena marmaiden asleep
in Willy Passmores boat

I wish it were any sich good luck she could hear Will say tis my
wife oh dear and he cowered down expecting the hearty cuff which he
received duly as the White Witch leaping out of the boat dared any
man to touch it and thundered to her husband to go home to bed

The wily dame as Rose well guessed was keeping up this delay chiefly
to gain time for her pupil but she had also more solid reasons for
making the fight as hard as possible for she as well as Rose had
already discerned in the ungainly figure of one of the party the same
suspicious Welsh gentleman on whose calling she had divined long
ago and she was so loyal a subject as to hold in extreme horror her
husbands meddling with such Popish skulkers as she called the whole
party roundly to their faceunless on consideration of a very handsome
sum of money In vain Parsons thundered Campian entreated Mr Leighs
groom swore and her husband danced round in an agony of mingled fear
and covetousness

No she cried as I am an honest woman and loyal This is why you
left the boat down to the shoore you old traitor you is it To help
off sich noxious trade as this out of the hands of her majestys quorum
and rotulorum Eh Stand back cowards Will you strike a woman

This last speech as usual was merely indicative of her intention to
strike the men for getting out one of the oars she swung it round and
round fiercely and at last caught Father Parsons such a crack across
the shins that he retreated with a howl

Lucy Lucy shrieked her husband in shrillest Devon falsetto be you
mazed Be you mazed lass They promised me two gold nobles before Id
lend them the boot

Tu shrieked the matron with a tone of ineffable scorn And do yu
call yourself a man

Tu nobles tu nobles shrieked he again hopping about at oars
length

Tu And would you sell your soul under ten

Oh if that is it cried poor Campian give her ten give her
ten brother ParsMorgans I mean and take care of your shins Offa
Cerbero you knowOh virago Furens quid faemina possit Certainly she
is some Lamia some Gorgon some

Take that for your Lamys and Gorgons to an honest woman and in
a moment poor Campians thin legs were cut from under him while the
virago mounting on his trunk astride like that more famous one on
Hudibras cried Ten nobles or Ill kep ye here till morning And the
ten nobles were paid into her hand

And now the boat its dragon guardian being pacified was run down to
the sea and close past the nook where poor little Rose was squeezing
herself into the farthest and darkest corner among wet seaweed and
rough barnacles holding her breath as they approached

They passed her and the boats keel was already in the water Lucy had
followed them close for reasons of her own and perceiving close to the
waters edge a dark cavern cunningly surmised that it contained Rose
and planted her ample person right across its mouth while she grumbled
at her husband the strangers and above all at Mr Leighs groom to
whom she prophesied pretty plainly Launceston gaol and the gallows
while the wretched servingman who would as soon have dared to leap off
Welcombe Cliff as to return railing for railing to the White Witch in
vain entreated her mercy and tried by all possible dodging to keep
one of the party between himself and her lest her redoubted eye should
overlook him once more to his ruin

But the nights adventures were not ended yet for just as the boat was
launched a faint halloo was heard upon the beach and a minute after
a horseman plunged down the pebbles and along the sand and pulling his
horse up on its haunches close to the terrified group dropped rather
than leaped from the saddle

The servingman though he dared not tackle a witch knew well enough
how to deal with a swordsman and drawing sprang upon the newcomer and
then recoiled

God forgive me its Mr Eustace Oh dear sir I took you for one of
Sir Richards men Oh sir youre hurt

A scratch a scratch almost moaned Eustace Help me into the boat
Jack Gentlemen I must with you

Not with us surely my dear son vagabonds upon the face of the
earth said kindhearted Campian

With you forever All is over here Whither God and the cause
leadand he staggered toward the boat

As he passed Rose she saw his ghastly bleeding face half bound up with
a handkerchief which could not conceal the convulsions of rage shame
and despair which twisted it from all its usual beauty His eyes glared
wildly roundand once right into the cavern They met hers so full
and keen and dreadful that forgetting she was utterly invisible the
terrified girl was on the point of shrieking aloud

He has overlooked me said she shuddering to herself as she
recollected his threat of yesterday

Who has wounded you asked Campian

My cousinAmyasand taken the letter

The devil take him then cried Parsons stamping up and down upon the
sand in fury

Ay curse himyou may I dare not He saved mesent me hereand
with a groan he made an effort to enter the boat

Oh my dear young gentleman cried Lucy Passmore her womans heart
bursting out at the sight of pain you must not goo forth with a grane
wound like to that Do ye let me just bind mun updo ye now and she
advanced

Eustace thrust her back

No better bear it I deserve itdevils I deserve it On board or we
shall all be lostWilliam Cary is close behind me

And at that news the boat was thrust into the sea faster than ever it
went before and only in time for it was but just round the rocks and
out of sight when the rattle of Carys horsehoofs was heard above

That rascal of Mr Leighs will catch it now the Popish villain said
Lucy Passmore aloud You lie still there dear life and settle your
sperrits youm so safe as ever was rabbit to burrow Ill see what
happens if I die for it And so saying she squeezed herself up
through a cleft to a higher ledge from whence she could see what passed
in the valley

There mun is in the meadow trying to catch the horses There comes
Mr Cary Goodness Father how a ridth hes over wall already Ron
Jack ron then All get to the river No a waint Goodness Father
Theres Mr Cary cotched mun As down as down

Is he dead asked Rose shuddering

Iss fegs dead as nits and Mr Cary off his horse standing
overthwart mun No a baint As up now Suspose he was hit wi the
flat Whatever is Mr Cary tu Telling wi mun a bit Oh dear dear
dear

Has he killed him cried poor Rose

No fegs no kecking mun kecking mun so hard as ever was futeball
Goodness Father who did ever If a havent kecked mun right into
river and got on muns horse and rod away

And so saying down she came again

And now then my dear life us be better to goo hoom and get you sommat
warm Youm mortal cold I rackon by now I was cruel feard for ye
but I kept mun off clever didnt I now

I wishI wish I had not seen Mr Leighs face

Iss dreadful werent it poor young soul a sad night for his poor
mother

Lucy I cant get his face out of my mind Im sure he overlooked me

Oh then who ever heard the like o that When young gentlemen do
overlook young ladies taint thikketheor aways I knoo Never you think
on it

But I cant help thinking of it said Rose Stop Shall we go home
yet Wheres that servant

Never mind he waint see us here under the hill Id much sooner to
know where my old man was Ive a sort of a forecasting in my inwards
like as I always has when aughts gwain to happen as though I shuldnt
zee mun again like I have miss Wellhe was a bedient old soul
after all he was Goodness Father and all this while us have forgot
the very thing us come about Who did you see

Only that face said Rose shuddering

Not in the glass maid Say then not in the glass

Would to heaven it had been Lucy what if he were the man I was fated
to

He Why hes a praste a Popish praste that cant marry if he would
poor wratch

He is none and I have cause enough to know it And for want of a
better confidant Rose poured into the willing ears of her companion the
whole story of yesterdays meeting

Hes a pretty wooer said Lucy at last contemptuously Be a brave
maid then be a brave maid and never terrify yourself with his unlucky
face Its because there was none here worthy of ye that ye seed none
in glass Maybe hes to be a foreigner from over seas and thats why
his sperit was so long a coming A duke or a prince to the least Ill
warrant hell be that carries off the Rose of Bideford

But in spite of all the good dames flattery Rose could not wipe that
fierce face away from her eyeballs She reached home safely and crept
to bed undiscovered and when the next morning as was to be expected
found her laid up with something very like a fever from excitement
terror and cold the phantom grew stronger and stronger before her and
it required all her womans tact and selfrestraint to avoid betraying
by her exclamations what had happened on that fantastic night After a
fortnights weakness however she recovered and went back to Bideford
but ere she arrived there Amyas was far across the seas on his way to
Milford Haven as shall be told in the ensuing chapters



CHAPTER VII

THE TRUE AND TRAGICAL HISTORY OF MR JOHN OXENHAM OF PLYMOUTH

 The fair breeze blew the white foam flew
 The furrow followd free
 We were the first that ever burst
 Into that silent sea

 The Ancient Mariner

It was too late and too dark last night to see the old house at Stow We
will look round us then this bright October day while Sir Richard and
Amyas about eleven oclock in the forenoon are pacing up and down the
terraced garden to the south Amyas has slept till luncheon i e till
an hour ago but Sir Richard in spite of the bustle of last night was
up and in the valley by six oclock recreating the valiant souls of
himself and two terrier dogs by the chase of sundry badgers

Old Stow House stands or rather stood some four miles beyond the
Cornish border on the northern slope of the largest and loveliest of
those combes of which I spoke in the last chapter Eighty years after
Sir Richards time there arose there a huge Palladian pile bedizened
with every monstrosity of bad taste which was built so the story runs
by Charles the Second for Sir Richards greatgrandson the heir of
that famous Sir Bevil who defeated the Parliamentary troops at Stratton
and died soon after fighting valiantly at Lansdowne over Bath But
like most other things which owed their existence to the Stuarts
it rose only to fall again An old man who had seen as a boy the
foundation of the new house laid lived to see it pulled down again
and the very bricks and timber sold upon the spot and since then the
stables have become a farmhouse the tenniscourt a sheepcote the
great quadrangle a rickyard and civilization spreading wave on
wave so fast elsewhere has surged back from that lonely corner of the
landlet us hope only for a while

But I am not writing of that great new Stow House of the past glories
whereof quaint pictures still hang in the neighboring houses nor of
that famed Sir Bevil most beautiful and gallant of his generation
on whom with his grandfather Sir Richard old Prince has his pompous
epigram

 Where next shall famous Grenvils ashes stand
 Thy grandsire fills the sea and thou the land

I have to deal with a simpler age and a sterner generation and with
the old house which had stood there in part at least from gray and
mythic ages when the first Sir Richard son of Hamon Dentatus Lord of
Carboyle the grandson of Duke Robert son of Rou settled at Bideford
after slaying the Prince of SouthGalis and the Lord of Glamorgan and
gave to the Cistercian monks of Neath all his conquests in South Wales
It was a huge rambling building half castle half dwellinghouse such
as may be seen still almost an unique specimen in Compton Castle
near Torquay the dwellingplace of Humphrey Gilbert Walter Raleighs
halfbrother and Richard Grenvilles bosom friend of whom more
hereafter On three sides to the north west and south the lofty
walls of the old ballium still stood with their machicolated turrets
loopholes and dark downward crannies for dropping stones and fire on
the besiegers the relics of a more unsettled age but the southern
court of the ballium had become a flowergarden with quaint terraces
statues knots of flowers clipped yews and hollies and all the
pedantries of the topiarian art And toward the east where the vista
of the valley opened the old walls were gone and the frowning Norman
keep ruined in the Wars of the Roses had been replaced by the rich
and stately architecture of the Tudors Altogether the house like the
time was in a transitionary state and represented faithfully enough
the passage of the old middle age into the new life which had just burst
into blossom throughout Europe never let us pray to see its autumn or
its winter

From the house on three sides the hill sloped steeply down and the
garden where Sir Richard and Amyas were walking gave a truly English
prospect At one turn they could catch over the western walls a
glimpse of the blue ocean flecked with passing sails and at the next
spread far below them range on range of fertile park stately avenue
yellow autumn woodland and purple heather moors lapping over and over
each other up the valley to the old British earthwork which stood black
and furzegrown on its conical peak and standing out against the sky on
the highest bank of hill which closed the valley to the east the lofty
tower of Kilkhampton church rich with the monuments and offerings of
five centuries of Grenvilles A yellow eastern haze hung soft over park
and wood and moor the red cattle lowed to each other as they stood
brushing away the flies in the rivulet far below the colts in the
horsepark close on their right whinnied as they played together and
their sires from the Queens Park on the opposite hill answered them
in fuller though fainter voices A rutting stag made the still woodland
rattle with his hoarse thunder and a rival far up the valley gave back
a trumpet note of defiance and was himself defied from heathery brows
which quivered far away above half seen through the veil of eastern
mist And close at home upon the terrace before the house amid romping
spaniels and goldenhaired children sat Lady Grenville herself the
beautiful St Leger of Annery the central jewel of all that glorious
place and looked down at her noble children and then up at her more
noble husband and round at that broad paradise of the West till life
seemed too full of happiness and heaven of light

And all the while up and down paced Amyas and Sir Richard talking long
earnestly and slow for they both knew that the turning point of the
boys life was come

Yes said Sir Richard after Amyas in his blunt simple way had told
him the whole story about Rose Salterne and his brotheryes sweet
lad thou hast chosen the better part thou and thy brother also and it
shall not be taken from you Only be strong lad and trust in God that
He will make a man of you

I do trust said Amyas

Thank God said Sir Richard that you have yourself taken from my
heart that which was my great anxiety for you from the day that your
good father who sleeps in peace committed you to my hands For all
best things Amyas become when misused the very worst and the love
of woman because it is able to lift mans soul to the heavens is also
able to drag him down to hell But you have learnt better Amyas and
know with our old German forefathers that as Tacitus saith Sera
juvenum Venus ideoque inexhausta pubertas And not only that Amyas
but trust me that silly fashion of the French and Italians to be
hanging ever at some womans apron string so that no boy shall count
himself a man unless he can vagghezziare le donne whether maids or
wives alas matters little that fashion I say is little less hurtful
to the soul than open sin for by it are bred vanity and expense envy
and heartburning yea hatred and murder often and even if that be
escaped yet the rich treasure of a manly worship which should be kept
for one alone is squandered and parted upon many and the bride at last
comes in for nothing but the very last leavings and caput mortuum of
her bridegrooms heart and becomes a mere ornament for his table and
a means whereby he may obtain a progeny May God who has saved me from
that death in life save you also And as he spoke he looked down
toward his wife upon the terrace below and she as if guessing
instinctively that he was talking of her looked up with so sweet
a smile that Sir Richards stern face melted into a very glory of
spiritual sunshine

Amyas looked at them both and sighed and then turning the conversation
suddenly

And I may go to Ireland tomorrow

You shall sail in the Mary for Milford Haven with these letters to
Winter If the wind serves you may bid the master drop down the river
tonight and be off for we must lose no time

Winter said Amyas He is no friend of mine since he left Drake and
us so cowardly at the Straits of Magellan

Duty must not wait for private quarrels even though they be just ones
lad but he will not be your general When you come to the marshal or
the Lord Deputy give either of them this letter and they will set you
workand hard work too I warrant

I want nothing better

Right lad the best reward for having wrought well already is to have
more to do and he that has been faithful over a few things must find
his account in being made ruler over many things That is the true and
heroical rest which only is worthy of gentlemen and sons of God As for
those who either in this world or the world to come look for idleness
and hope that God shall feed them with pleasant things as it were with
a spoon Amyas I count them cowards and base even though they call
themselves saints and elect

I wish you could persuade my poor cousin of that

He has yet to learn what losing his life to save it means Amyas Bad
men have taught him and I fear these Anabaptists and Puritans at home
teach little else that it is the one great business of every one to
save his own soul after he dies every one for himself and that that
and not divine selfsacrifice is the one thing needful and the better
part which Mary chose

I think men are inclined enough already to be selfish without being
taught that

Right lad For me if I could hang up such a teacher on high as an
enemy of mankind and a corrupter of youth I would do it gladly Is
there not cowardice and selfseeking enough about the hearts of us
fallen sons of Adam that these false prophets with their baits of
heaven and their terrors of hell must exalt our dirtiest vices into
heavenly virtues and the means of bliss Farewell to chivalry and to
desperate valor farewell to patriotism and loyalty farewell to England
and to the manhood of England if once it shall become the fashion of
our preachers to bid every man as the Jesuits do take care first of
what they call the safety of his soul Every man will be afraid to die
at his post because he will be afraid that he is not fit to die Amyas
do thou do thy duty like a man to thy country thy queen and thy God
and count thy life a worthless thing as did the holy men of old Do
thy work lad and leave thy soul to the care of Him who is just and
merciful in this that He rewards every man according to his work Is
there respect of persons with God Now come in and take the letters
and to horse And if I hear of thee dead there at Smerwick fort with
all thy wounds in front I shall weep for thy mother lad but I shall
have never a sigh for thee

If any one shall be startled at hearing a fine gentleman and a warrior
like Sir Richard quote Scripture and think Scripture also they must
be referred to the writings of the time which they may read not without
profit to themselves if they discover therefrom how it was possible
then for men of the world to be thoroughly ingrained with the Gospel
and yet to be free from any taint of superstitious fear or false
devoutness The religion of those days was such as no soldier need have
been ashamed of confessing At least Sir Richard died as he lived
without a shudder and without a whine and these were his last words
fifteen years after that as he lay shot through and through a captive
among Popish Spaniards priests crucifixes confession extreme
unction and all other means and appliances for delivering men out of
the hands of a God of love

Here die I Richard Grenville with a joyful and quiet mind for that
I have ended my life as a true soldier ought fighting for his country
queen religion and honor my soul willingly departing from this body
leaving behind the lasting fame of having behaved as every valiant
soldier is in his duty bound to do

Those were the last words of Richard Grenville The pulpits of those
days had taught them to him

But to return That days events were not over yet For when they went
down into the house the first person whom they met was the old steward
in search of his master

There is a manner of roog Sir Richard a masterless man at the door
a very forward fellow and must needs speak with you

A masterless man He had better not to speak to me unless he is in
love with gaol and gallows

Well your worship said the steward I expect that is what he does
want for he swears he will not leave the gate till he has seen you

Seen me Halidame he shall see me here and at Launceston too if he
likes Bring him in

Fegs Sir Richard we are half afeard With your good leave

Hillo Tony cried Amyas who was ever afeard yet with Sir Richards
good leave

What has the fellow a tail or horns

Massy no but I be afeard of treason for your honor for the fellow is
pinked all over in heathen patterns and as brown as a filbert and a
tall roog a very strong roog sir and a foreigner too and a mighty
staff with him I expect him to be a manner of Jesuit or wild Irish
sir and indeed the grooms have no stomach to handle him nor the dogs
neither or he had been under the pump before now for they that saw him
coming up the hill swear that he had fire coming out of his mouth

Fire out of his mouth said Sir Richard The men are drunk

Pinked all over He must be a sailor said Amyas let me out and see
the fellow and if he needs putting forth

Why I dare say he is not so big but what he will go into thy pocket
So go lad while I finish my writing

Amyas went out and at the back door leaning on his staff stood a
tall rawboned ragged man pinked all over as the steward had said

Hillo lad quoth Amyas Before we come to talk thou wilt please to
lay down that Plymouth cloak of thine And he pointed to the cudgel
which among Westcountry mariners usually bore that name

Ill warrant said the old steward that where he found his cloak he
found purse not far off

But not hose or doublet so the magical virtue of his staff has
not helped him much But put down thy staff man and speak like a
Christian if thou be one

I am a Christian though I look like a heathen and no rogue though
a masterless man alas But I want nothing deserving nothing and only
ask to speak with Sir Richard before I go on my way

There was something stately and yet humble about the mans tone and
manner which attracted Amyas and he asked more gently where he was
going and whence he came

From Padstow Port sir to Clovelly town to see my old mother if
indeed she be yet alive which God knoweth

Clovally man why didnt thee say thee was Clovally man asked all the
grooms at once to whom a Westcountryman was of course a brother The
old steward asked

Whats thy mothers name then

Susan Yeo

What that lived under the archway asked a groom

Lived said the man

Iss sure her died three days since so we heard poor soul

The man stood quite silent and unmoved for a minute or two and then
said quietly to himself in Spanish That which is is best

You speak Spanish asked Amyas more and more interested

I had need to do so young sir I have been five years in the Spanish
Main and only set foot on shore two days ago and if you will let me
have speech of Sir Richard I will tell him that at which both the ears
of him that heareth it shall tingle and if not I can but go on to Mr
Cary of Clovelly if he be yet alive and there disburden my soul but I
would sooner have spoken with one that is a mariner like to myself

And you shall said Amyas Steward we will have this man in for all
his rags he is a man of wit And he led him in

I only hope he bent one of those Popish murderers said the old
steward keeping at a safe distance from him as they entered the hall

Popish old master Theres little fear of my being that Look here
And drawing back his rags he showed a ghastly scar which encircled his
wrist and wound round and up his forearm

I got that on the rack said he quietly in the Inquisition at
Lima

O Father Father why didnt you tell us that you were a poor
Christian asked the penitent steward

Because I have had naught but my deserts and but a taste of them
either as the Lord knoweth who delivered me and I wasnt going to make
myself a beggar and a show on their account

By heaven you are a brave fellow said Amyas Come along straight to
Sir Richards room

So in they went where Sir Richard sat in his library among books
despatches statepapers and warrants for though he was not yet as in
after times after the fashion of those days admiral general member
of parliament privy councillor justice of the peace and so forth all
at once yet there were few great men with whom he did not correspond
or great matters with which he was not cognizant

Hillo Amyas have you bound the wild man already and brought him in
to swear allegiance

But before Amyas could answer the man looked earnestly on himAmyas
said he is that your name sir

Amyas Leigh is my name at your service good fellow

Of Burrough by Bideford

Why then What do you know of me

Oh sir sir young brains and happy ones have short memories but old
and sad brains too long ones often Do you mind one that was with Mr
Oxenham sir A swearing reprobate he was God forgive him and hath
forgiven him too for His dear Sons sakeone sir that gave you a
horn a toy with a chart on it

Soul alive cried Amyas catching him by the hand and are you he
The horn why I have it still and will keep it to my dying day too
But where is Mr Oxenham

Yes my good fellow where is Mr Oxenham asked Sir Richard rising
You are somewhat overhasty in welcoming your old acquaintance Amyas
before we have heard from him whether he can give honest account of
himself and of his captain For there is more than one way by which
sailors may come home without their captains as poor Mr Barker of
Bristol found to his cost God grant that there may have been no such
traitorous dealing here

Sir Richard Grenville if I had been a guilty man to my noble captain
as I have to God I had not come here this day to you from whom
villainy has never found favor nor ever will for I know your
conditions well sir and trust in the Lord that if you will be pleased
to hear me you shall know mine

Thou art a wellspoken knave We shall see

My dear sir said Amyas in a whisper I will warrant this man
guiltless

I verily believe him to be but this is too serious a matter to be left
on guess If he will be sworn

Whereon the man humbly enough said that if it would please Sir
Richard he would rather not be sworn

But it does not please me rascal Did I not warn thee Amyas

Sir said the man proudly God forbid that my word should not be as
good as my oath but it is against my conscience to be sworn

What have we here some fantastical Anabaptist who is wiser than his
teachers

My conscience sir

The devil take it and thee I never heard a man yet begin to prate of
his conscience but I knew that he was about to do something more than
ordinarily cruel or false

Sir said the man coolly enough do you sit here to judge me
according to law and yet contrary to the law swear profane oaths for
which a fine is provided

Amyas expected an explosion but Sir Richard pulled a shilling out and
put it on the table Theremy fine is paid sirrah to the poor of
Kilkhampton but hearken thou all the same If thou wilt not speak an
oath thou shalt speak on compulsion for to Launceston gaol thou goest
there to answer for Mr Oxenhams death on suspicion whereof and of
mutiny causing it I will attach thee and every soul of his crew that
comes home We have lost too many gallant captains of late by treachery
of their crews and he that will not clear himself on oath must be held
for guilty and selfcondemned

My good fellow said Amyas who could not give up his belief in the
mans honesty why for such fantastical scruples peril not only your
life but your honor and Mr Oxenhams also For if you be examined by
question you may be forced by torment to say that which is not true

Little fear of that young sir answered he with a grim smile I
have had too much of the rack already and the strappado too to care
much what man can do unto me I would heartily that I thought it lawful
to be sworn but not so thinking I can but submit to the cruelty of
man though I did expect more merciful things as a most miserable and
wrecked mariner at the hands of one who hath himself seen Gods ways
in the sea and His wonders in the great deep Sir Richard Grenville
if you will hear my story may God avenge on my head all my sins from my
youth up until now and cut me off from the blood of Christ and if it
were possible from the number of His elect if I tell you one whit more
or less than truth and if not I commend myself into the hands of God

Sir Richard smiled Well thou art a brave ass and valiant though an
ass manifest Dost thou not see fellow how thou hast sworn a tentimes
bigger oath than ever I should have asked of thee But this is the way
with your Anabaptists who by their very hatred of forms and ceremonies
show of how much account they think them and then bind themselves out
of their own fantastical selfwill with far heavier burdens than ever
the lawful authorities have laid on them for the sake of the commonweal
But what do they care for the commonweal as long as they can save as
they fancy each man his own dirty soul for himself However thou art
sworn now with a vengeance go on with thy tale and first who art
thou and whence

Well sir said the man quite unmoved by this last explosion my
name is Salvation Yeo born in Clovelly Street in the year 1526 where
my father exercised the mystery of a barber surgeon and a preacher of
the people since called Anabaptists for which I return humble thanks to
God

Sir RichardFie thou naughty knave return thanks that thy father was
an ass

YeoNay but because he was a barber surgeon for I myself learnt
a touch of that trade and thereby saved my life as I will tell
presently And I do think that a good mariner ought to have all
knowledge of carnal and worldly cunning even to tailoring and
shoemaking that he may be able to turn his hand to whatsoever may hap

Sir RichardWell spoken fellow but let us have thy text without thy
comments Forwards

YeoWell sir I was bred to the sea from my youth and was with
Captain Hawkins in his three voyages which he made to Guinea for negro
slaves and thence to the West Indies

Sir RichardThen thrice thou wentest to a bad end though Captain
Hawkins be my good friend and the last time to a bad end thou camest

YeoNo denying that last your worship but as for the former I
doubtabout the unlawfulness I mean being the negroes are of the
children of Ham who are cursed and reprobate as Scripture declares
and their blackness testifies being Satans own livery among whom
therefore there can be none of the elect wherefore the elect are not
required to treat them as brethren

Sir RichardWhat a plague of a pragmatical sealawyer have we here
And I doubt not thou hypocrite that though thou wilt call the negroes
black skin Satans livery when it serves thy turn to steal them thou
wilt find out sables to be Heavens livery every Sunday and up with a
godly howl unless a parson shall preach in a black gown Geneva fashion
Out upon thee Go on with thy tale lest thou finish thy sermon at
Launceston after all

YeoThe Lords people were always a reviled people and a persecuted
people but I will go forward sir for Heaven forbid but that I should
declare what God has done for me For till lately from my youth up
I was given over to all wretchlessness and unclean living and was by
nature a child of the devil and to every good work reprobate even as
others

Sir RichardHark to his even as others Thou newwhelped Pharisee
canst not confess thine own villainies without making out others as bad
as thyself and so thyself no worse than others I only hope that thou
hast shown none of thy devils doings to Mr Oxenham

YeoOn the word of a Christian man sir as I said before I kept true
faith with him and would have been a better friend to him sir what is
more than ever he was to himself

Sir RichardAlas that might easily be

YeoI think sir and will make good against any man that Mr Oxenham
was a noble and valiant gentleman true of his word stout of his sword
skilful by sea and land and worthy to have been Lord High Admiral of
England saving your worships presence but that through two great
sins wrath and avarice he was cast away miserably or ever his soul was
brought to the knowledge of the truth Ah sir he was a captain worth
sailing under

And Yeo heaved a deep sigh

Sir RichardSteady steady good fellow If thou wouldst quit
preaching thou art no fool after all But tell us the story without
more bushbeating

So at last Yeo settled himself to his tale

Well sirs I went as Mr Leigh knows to Nombre de Dios with Mr
Drake and Mr Oxenham in 1572 where what we saw and did your worship
I suppose knows as well as I and there was as youve heard maybe
a covenant between Mr Oxenham and Mr Drake to sail the South Seas
together which they made your worship in my hearing under the tree
over Panama For when Mr Drake came down from the tree after seeing
the sea afar off Mr Oxenham and I went up and saw it too and when we
came down Drake says John I have made a vow to God that I will sail
that water if I live and God gives me grace which he had done sir
upon his bended knees like a godly man as he always was and would I
had taken after him and Mr O says I am with you Drake to live or
die and I think I know some one there already so we shall not be quite
among strangers and laughed withal Well sirs that voyage as you
know never came off because Captain Drake was fighting in Ireland so
Mr Oxenham who must be up and doing sailed for himself and I who
loved him God knows like a brother saving the difference in our
ranks helped him to get the crew together and went as his gunner
That was in 1575 as you know he had a 140ton ship sir and seventy
men out of Plymouth and Fowey and Dartmouth and many of them old hands
of Drakes beside a dozen or so from Bideford that I picked up when I
saw young Master here

Thank God that you did not pick me up too

Amen amen said Yeo clasping his hands on his breast Those seventy
men sirseventy gallant men sir with every one of them an immortal
soul within himwhere are they now Gone like the spray And he
swept his hands abroad with a wild and solemn gesture And their blood
is upon my head

Both Sir Richard and Amyas began to suspect that the mans brain was not
altogether sound

God forbid my man said the knight kindly

Thirteen men I persuaded to join in Bideford town beside William
Penberthy of Marazion my good comrade And what if it be said to me at
the day of judgment Salvation Yeo where are those fourteen whom thou
didst tempt to their deaths by covetousness and lust of gold Not that
I was alone in my sin if the truth must be told For all the way out
Mr Oxenham was making loud speech after his pleasant way that he
would make all their fortunes and take them to such a Paradise that
they should have no lust to come home again And IGod knows whyfor
every one boast of his would make two even to lying and empty fables
and anything to keep up the mens hearts For I had really persuaded
myself that we should all find treasures beyond Solomon his temple
and Mr Oxenham would surely show us how to conquer some golden city or
discover some island all made of precious stones And one day as the
captain and I were talking after our fashion I said And you shall be
our king captain To which he If I be I shall not be long without
a queen and that no Indian one either And after that he often jested
about the Spanish ladies saying that none could show us the way to
their hearts better than he Which speeches I took no count of then
sirs but after I minded them whether I would or not Well sirs we
came to the shore of New Spain near to the old placethats Nombre
de Dios and there Mr Oxenham went ashore into the woods with a boats
crew to find the negroes who helped us three years before Those are
the Cimaroons gentles negro slaves who have fled from those devils
incarnate their Spanish masters and live wild like the beasts
that perish men of great stature sirs and fierce as wolves in
the onslaught but poor jabbering mazed fellows if they be but a bit
dismayed and have many Indian women with them who take to these
negroes a deal better than to their own kin which breeds war enough as
you may guess

Well sirs after three days the captain comes back looking heavy
enough and says We played our trick once too often when we played
it once There is no chance of stopping another reco that is a
muletrain sirs now The Cimaroons say that since our last visit
they never move without plenty of soldiers two hundred shot at least
Therefore he said my gallants we must either return emptyhanded
from this the very market and treasury of the whole Indies or do such
a deed as men never did before which I shall like all the better for
that very reason And we asking his meaning Why he said if Drake
will not sail the South Seas we will adding profanely that Drake was
like Moses who beheld the promised land afar but he was Joshua who
would enter into it and smite the inhabitants thereof And for our
confirmation showed me and the rest the superscription of a letter and
said How I came by this is none of your business but I have had it in
my bosom ever since I left Plymouth and I tell you now what I forbore
to tell you at first that the South Seas have been my mark all along
such news have I herein of plateships and goldships and what not
which will come up from Quito and Lima this very month all which with
the pearls of the Gulf of Panama and other wealth unspeakable will be
ours if we have but true English hearts within us

At which gentles we were like madmen for lust of that gold and
cheerfully undertook a toil incredible for first we run our ship
aground in a great wood which grew in the very sea itself and then took
out her masts and covered her in boughs with her four cast pieces of
great ordnance of which more hereafter and leaving no man in her
started for the South Seas across the neck of Panama with two small
pieces of ordnance and our culverins and good store of victuals and
with us six of those negroes for a guide and so twelve leagues to a
river which runs into the South Sea

And there having cut wood we made a pinnace and work enough we had
at it of fiveandforty foot in the keel and in her down the stream
and to the Isle of Pearls in the Gulf of Panama

Into the South Sea Impossible said Sir Richard Have a care what
you say my man for there is that about you which would make me sorry
to find you out a liar

Impossible or not liar or none we went there sir

Question him Amyas lest he turn out to have been beforehand with
you

The man looked inquiringly at Amyas who said

Well my man of the Gulf of Panama I cannot ask you for I never was
inside it but what other parts of the coast do you know

Every inch sir from Cabo San Francisco to Lima more is my sorrow
for I was a galleyslave there for two years and more

You know Lima

I was there three times worshipful gentlemen and the last was
February come two years and there I helped lade a great plateship the
Cacafuogo they called her

Amyas started Sir Richard nodded to him gently to be silent and then

And what became of her my lad

God knows who knows all and the devil who freighted her I broke
prison six weeks afterwards and never heard but that she got safe into
Panama

You never heard then that she was taken

Taken your worships Who should take her

Why should not a good English ship take her as well as another said
Amyas

Lord love you sir yes faith if they had but been there Manys the
time that I thought to myself as we went alongside Oh if Captain
Drake was but here well to windward and our old crew of the Dragon
Ask your pardon gentles but how is Captain Drake if I may make so
bold

Neither could hold out longer

Fellow fellow cried Sir Richard springing up either thou art the
cunningest liar that ever earned a halter or thou hast done a deed
the like of which never man adventured Dost thou not know that Captain
Drake took that Cacafuogo and all her freight in February come two
years

Captain Drake God forgive me sir butCaptain Drake in the South
Seas He saw them sir from the treetop over Panama when I was with
him and I too but sailed them sirsailed them

Yes and round the world too said Amyas and I with him and took
that very Cacafuogo off Cape San Francisco as she came up to Panama

One glance at the mans face was enough to prove his sincerity The
great stern Anabaptist who had not winced at the news of his mothers
death dropt right on his knees on the floor and burst into violent
sobs

Glory to God Glory to God O Lord I thank thee Captain Drake in
the South Seas The blood of thy innocents avenged O Lord The spoiler
spoiled and the proud robbed and all they whose hands were mighty have
found nothing Glory glory Oh tell me sir did she fight

We gave her three pieces of ordnance only and struck down her
mizzenmast and then boarded sword in hand but never had need to strike
a blow and before we left her one of her own boys had changed her
name and rechristened her the Cacaplata

Glory glory Cowards they are as I told them I told them they never
could stand the Devon mastiffs and well they flogged me for saying it
but they could not stop my mouth O sir tell me did you get the ship
that came up after her

What was that

A long raceship sir from Guayaquil with an old gentleman on
boardDon Francisco de Xararte was his name and by token he had a
gold falcon hanging to a chain round his neck and a green stone in the
breast of it I saw it as we rowed him aboard O tell me sir tell me
for the love of God did you take that ship

We did take that ship and the jewel too and her majesty has it at
this very hour

Then tell me sir said he slowly as if he dreaded an answer tell
me sir and oh try and mindwas there a little maid aboard with the
old gentleman

A little maid Let me think No I saw none

The man settled his features again sadly

I thought not I never saw her come aboard Still I hoped like I
hoped Alackaday God help me Salvation Yeo

What have you to do with this little maid then good fellow asked
Grenville

Ah sir before I tell you that I must go back and finish the story of
Mr Oxenham if you will believe me enough to hear it

I do believe thee good fellow and honor thee too

Then sir I can speak with a free tongue Where was I

Where was he Amyas

At the Isle of Pearls

And yet O gentles tell me first how Captain Drake came into the
South Seasover the neck as we did

Through the Straits good fellow like any Spaniard but go on with thy
story and thou shalt have Mr Leighs after

Through the Straits O glory But Ill tell my tale Well sirs
bothTo the Island of Pearls we came we and some of the negroes We
found many huts and Indians fishing for pearls and also a fair house
with porches but no Spaniard therein save one man at which Mr
Oxenham was like a man transported and fell on that Spaniard crying
Perro where is your mistress Where is the bark from Lima To which
he boldly enough What was his mistress to the Englishman But Mr O
threatened to twine a cord round his head till his eyes burst out and
the Spaniard being terrified said that the ship from Lima was expected
in a fortnights time So for ten days we lay quiet letting neither
negro nor Spaniard leave the island and took good store of pearls
feeding sumptuously on wild cattle and hogs until the tenth day when
there came by a small bark her we took and found her from Quito and
on board 60000 pezos of gold and other store With which if we had been
content gentlemen all had gone well And some were willing to go back
at once having both treasure and pearls in plenty but Mr O he
waxed right mad and swore to slay any one who made that motion again
assuring us that the Lima ship of which he had news was far greater and
richer and would make princes of us all which bark came in sight on
the sixteenth day and was taken without shot or slaughter The taking
of which bark I verily believe was the ruin of every mothers son of
us

And being asked why he answered First because of the discontent
which was bred thereby for on board was found no gold but only 100000
pezos of silver

Sir Richard GrenvilleThou greedy fellow and was not that enough to
stay your stomachs

Yeo answered that he would to God it had been and that moreover the
weight of that silver was afterwards a hindrance to them and fresh
cause of discontent as he would afterwards declare So that it had
been well for us sirs if we had left it behind as Mr Drake left his
three years before and carried away the gold only In which I do see
the evident hand of God and His just punishment for our greediness
of gain who caused Mr Oxenham by whom we had hoped to attain great
wealth to be a snare to us and a cause of utter ruin

Do you think then said Sir Richard that Mr Oxenham deceived you
wilfully

I will never believe that sir Mr Oxenham had his private reasons for
waiting for that ship for the sake of one on board whose face would
that he had never seen though he saw it then as I fear not for the
first time by many a one And so was silent

Come said both his hearers you have brought us thus far and you
must go on

Gentlemen I have concealed this matter from all men both on my voyage
home and since and I hope you will be secret in the matter for the
honor of my noble captain and the comfort of his friends who are alive
For I think it shame to publish harm of a gallant gentleman and of an
ancient and worshipful family and to me a true and kind captain when
what is done cannot be undone and least said soonest mended Neither
now would I have spoken of it but that I was inwardly moved to it for
the sake of that young gentleman there looking at Amyas that
he might be warned in time of Gods wrath against the crying sin of
adultery and flee youthful lusts which war against the soul

Thou hast done wisely enough then said Sir Richard and look to it
if I do not reward thee but the young gentleman here thank God needs
no such warnings having got them already both by precept and example
where thou and poor Oxenham might have had them also

You mean Captain Drake your worship

I do sirrah If all men were as clean livers as he the world would be
spared one half the tears that are shed in it

Amen sir At least there would have been many a tear spared to us and
ours Foras all must outin that bark of Lima he took a young
lady as fair as the sunshine sir and seemingly about two or
threeandtwenty years of age having with her a tall young lad of
sixteen and a little girl a marvellously pretty child of about a
six or seven And the lady herself was of an excellent beauty like a
whales tooth for whiteness so that all the crew wondered at her and
could not be satisfied with looking upon her And gentlemen this was
strange that the lady seemed in no wise afraid or mournful and bid
her little girl fear naught as did also Mr Oxenham but the lad kept a
very sour countenance and the more when he saw the lady and Mr Oxenham
speaking together apart

Well sir after this good luck we were minded to have gone straight
back to the river whence we came and so home to England with all speed
But Mr Oxenham persuaded us to return to the island and get a few more
pearls To which foolishness which after caused the mishap I verily
believe he was moved by the instigation of the devil and of that lady
For as we were about to go ashore I going down into the cabin of the
prize saw Mr Oxenham and that lady making great cheer of each other
with My life and My king and Light of my eyes and such toys
and being bidden by Mr Oxenham to fetch out the ladys mails and take
them ashore heard how the two laughed together about the old ape of
Panama which ape or devil rather I saw afterwards to my cost and
also how she said that she had been dead for five years and now that
Mr Oxenham was come she was alive again and so forth

Mr Oxenham bade take the little maid ashore kissing her and playing
with her and saying to the lady What is yours is mine and what is
mine is yours And she asking whether the lad should come ashore he
answered He is neither yours nor mine let the spawn of Beelzebub stay
on shore After which I coming on deck again stumbled over that very
lad upon the hatchway ladder who bore so black and despiteful a face
that I verily believe he had overheard their speech and so thrust him
upon deck and going below again told Mr Oxenham what I thought and
said that it were better to put a dagger into him at once professing to
be ready so to do For which grievous sin seeing that it was
committed in my unregenerate days I hope I have obtained the grace of
forgiveness as I have that of hearty repentance But the lady cried
out Though he be none of mine I have sin enough already on my soul
and so laid her hand on Mr Oxenhams mouth entreating pitifully And
Mr Oxenham answered laughing when she would let him What care we
let the young monkey go and howl to the old one and so went ashore
with the lady to that house whence for three days he never came forth
and would have remained longer but that the men finding but few
pearls and being wearied with the watching and warding so many
Spaniards and negroes came clamoring to him and swore that they
would return or leave him there with the lady So all went on board
the pinnace again every one in ill humor with the captain and he with
them

Well sirs we came back to the mouth of the river and there began our
troubles for the negroes as soon as we were on shore called on Mr
Oxenham to fulfil the bargain he had made with them And now it came out
what few of us knew till then that he had agreed with the Cimaroons
that they should have all the prisoners which were taken save the gold
And he though loath was about to give up the Spaniards to them near
forty in all supposing that they intended to use them as slaves but
as we all stood talking one of the Spaniards understanding what was
forward threw himself on his knees before Mr Oxenham and shrieking
like a madman entreated not to be given up into the hands of those
devils said he who never take a Spanish prisoner but they roast him
alive and then eat his heart among them We asked the negroes if this
was possible To which some answered What was that to us But others
said boldly that it was true enough and that revenge made the best
sauce and nothing was so sweet as Spanish blood and one pointing
to the lady said such foul and devilish things as I should be ashamed
either for me to speak or you to hear At this we were like men amazed
for very horror and Mr Oxenham said You incarnate fiends if you had
taken these fellows for slaves it had been fair enough for you were
once slaves to them and I doubt not cruelly used enough but as for
this abomination says he God do so to me and more also if I
let one of them come into your murderous hands So there was a great
quarrel but Mr Oxenham stoutly bade put the prisoners on board
the ships again and so let the prizes go taking with him only the
treasure and the lady and the little maid And so the lad went on to
Panama Gods wrath having gone out against us

Well sirs the Cimaroons after that went away from us swearing
revenge for which we cared little enough and we rowed up the river
to a place where three streams met and then up the least of the three
some four days journey till it grew all shoal and swift and there we
hauled the pinnace upon the sands and Mr Oxenham asked the men whether
they were willing to carry the gold and silver over the mountains to the
North Sea Some of them at first were loath to do it and I and others
advised that we should leave the plate behind and take the gold only
for it would have cost us three or four journeys at the least But Mr
Oxenham promised every man 100 pezos of silver over and above his wages
which made them content enough and we were all to start the morrow
morning But sirs that night as God had ordained came a mishap by
some rash speeches of Mr Oxenhams which threw all abroad again for
when we had carried the treasure about half a league inland and hidden
it away in a house which we made of boughs Mr O being always full of
that his fair lady spoke to me and William Penberthy of Marazion my
good comrade and a few more saying That we had no need to return
to England seeing that we were already in the very garden of Eden and
wanted for nothing but could live without labor or toil and that it
was better when we got over to the North Sea to go and seek out some
fair island and there dwell in joy and pleasure till our lives end
And we two he said will be king and queen and you whom I can
trust my officers and for servants we will have the Indians who I
warrant will be more fain to serve honest and merry masters like us
than those Spanish devils and much more of the like which words I
liked wellmy mind alas being given altogether to carnal pleasure
and vanityas did William Penberthy my good comrade on whom I trust
God has had mercy But the rest sirs took the matter all across and
began murmuring against the captain saying that poor honest mariners
like them had always the labor and the pain while he took his delight
with his lady and that they would have at least one merry night before
they were slain by the Cimaroons or eaten by panthers and lagartos
and so got out of the pinnace two great skins of Canary wine which were
taken in the Lima prize and sat themselves down to drink Moreover
there were in the pinnace a great sight of hens which came from the
same prize by which Mr O set great store keeping them for the lady
and the little maid and falling upon these the men began to blaspheme
saying What a plague had the captain to fill the boat with dirty live
lumber for that giglets sake They had a better right to a good supper
than ever she had and might fast awhile to cool her hot blood and
so cooked and ate those hens plucking them on board the pinnace and
letting the feathers fall into the stream But when William Penberthy
my good comrade saw the feathers floating away down he asked them if
they were mad to lay a trail by which the Spaniards would surely track
them out if they came after them as without doubt they would But they
laughed him to scorn and said that no Spanish cur dared follow on
the heels of true English mastiffs as they were and other boastful
speeches and at last being heated with wine began afresh to murmur at
the captain And one speaking of his counsel about the island the rest
altogether took it amiss and out of the way and some sprang up crying
treason and others that he meant to defraud them of the plate which he
had promised and others that he meant to desert them in a strange land
and so forth till Mr O hearing the hubbub came out to them from
the house when they reviled him foully swearing that he meant to cheat
them and one Edward Stiles a Wapping man mad with drink dared to say
that he was a fool for not giving up the prisoners to the negroes and
what was it to him if the lady roasted the negroes should have her yet
and drawing his sword ran upon the captain for which I was about to
strike him through the body but the captain not caring to waste steel
on such a ribald with his fist caught him such a buffet behind the ear
that he fell down stark dead and all the rest stood amazed Then Mr
Oxenham called out All honest men who know me and can trust me stand
by your lawful captain against these ruffians Whereon sirs I and
Penberthy my good comrade and four Plymouth men who had sailed with
Mr O in Mr Drakes ship and knew his trusty and valiant conditions
came over to him and swore before God to stand by him and the lady
Then said Mr O to the rest Will you carry this treasure knaves
or will you not Give me an answer here And they refused unless he
would before they started give each man his share So Mr O waxed
very mad and swore that he would never be served by men who did not
trust him and so went in again and that night was spent in great
disquiet I and those five others keeping watch about the house of
boughs till the rest fell asleep in their drink And next morning when
the wine was gone out of them Mr O asked them whether they would go
to the hills with him and find those negroes and persuade them after
all to carry the treasure To which they agreed after awhile thinking
that so they should save themselves labor and went off with Mr
Oxenham leaving us six who had stood by him to watch the lady and the
treasure after he had taken an oath of us that we would deal justly and
obediently by him and by her which God knows gentlemen we did So
he parted with much weeping and wailing of the lady and was gone seven
days and all that time we kept that lady faithfully and honestly
bringing her the best we could find and serving her upon our bended
knees both for her admirable beauty and for her excellent conditions
for she was certainly of some noble kin and courteous and without
fear as if she had been a very princess But she kept always within the
house which the little maid God bless her did not but soon learned
to play with us and we with her so that we made great cheer of her
gentlemen sailor fashionfor you know we must always have our minions
aboard to pet and amuse usmaybe a monkey or a little dog or a
singing bird ay or mice and spiders if we have nothing better to
play withal And she was wonderful sharp sirs was the little maid and
picked up her English from us fast calling us jolly mariners which I
doubt but she has forgotten by now but I hope in God it be not so and
therewith the good fellow began wiping his eyes

Well sir on the seventh day we six were down by the pinnace clearing
her out and the little maid with us gathering of flowers and William
Penberthy fishing on the bank about a hundred yards below when on
a sudden he leaps up and runs toward us crying Here come our hens
feathers back again with a vengeance and so bade catch up the little
maid and run for the house for the Spaniards were upon us

Which was too true for before we could win the house there were full
eighty shot at our heels but could not overtake us nevertheless some
of them stopping fixed their calivers and let fly killing one of the
Plymouth men The rest of us escaped to the house and catching up the
lady fled forth not knowing whither we went while the Spaniards
finding the house and treasure pursued us no farther

For all that day and the next we wandered in great misery the lady
weeping continually and calling for Mr Oxenham most piteously and
the little maid likewise till with much ado we found the track of our
comrades and went up that as best we might but at nightfall by good
hap we met the whole crew coming back and with them 200 negroes or
more with bows and arrows At which sight was great joy and embracing
and it was a strange thing sirs to see the lady for before that she
was altogether desperate and yet she was now a very lioness as soon
as she had got her love again and prayed him earnestly not to care
for that gold but to go forward to the North Sea vowing to him in my
hearing that she cared no more for poverty than she had cared for her
good name and thenthey being a little apart from the restpointed
round to the green forest and said in Spanishwhich I suppose they
knew not that I understoodSee all round us is Paradise Were it not
enough for you and me to stay here forever and let them take the gold
or leave it as they will

To which Mr OxenhamThose who lived in Paradise had not sinned as we
have and would never have grown old or sick as we shall

And sheIf we do that there are poisons enough in these woods by
which we may die in each others arms as would to Heaven we had died
seven years agone

But heNo no my life It stands upon my honor both to fulfil my
bond with these men whom I have brought hither and to take home to
England at least something of my prize as a proof of my own valor

Then she smilingAm I not prize enough and proof enough But he
would not be so tempted and turning to us offered us the half of that
treasure if we would go back with him and rescue it from the Spaniard
At which the lady wept and wailed much but I took upon myself to
comfort her though I was but a simple mariner telling her that it
stood upon Mr Oxenhams honor and that in England nothing was esteemed
so foul as cowardice or breaking word and troth betwixt man and man
and that better was it for him to die seven times by the Spaniards than
to face at home the scorn of all who sailed the seas So after much
ado back they went again I and Penberthy and the three Plymouth men
which escaped from the pinnace keeping the lady as before

Well sirs we waited five days having made houses of boughs as
before without hearing aught and on the sixth we saw coming afar off
Mr Oxenham and with him fifteen or twenty men who seemed very weary
and wounded and when we looked for the rest to be behind them behold
there were no more at which sirs as you may well think our hearts
sank within us

And Mr O coming nearer cried out afar off All is lost and so
walked into the camp without a word and sat himself down at the foot
of a great tree with his head between his hands speaking neither to the
lady or to any one till she very pitifully kneeling before him cursing
herself for the cause of all his mischief and praying him to avenge
himself upon that her tender body won him hardly to look once upon her
after which as is the way of vain and unstable man all between them
was as before

But the men were full of curses against the negroes for their
cowardice and treachery yea and against high Heaven itself which had
put the most part of their ammunition into the Spaniards hands and
told me and I believe truly how they forced the enemy awaiting them in
a little copse of great trees well fortified with barricades of boughs
and having with them our two falcons which they had taken out of the
pinnace And how Mr Oxenham divided both the English and the negroes
into two bands that one might attack the enemy in front and the
other in the rear and so set upon them with great fury and would have
utterly driven them out but that the negroes who had come on with much
howling like very wild beasts being suddenly scared with the shot and
noise of the ordnance turned and fled leaving the Englishmen alone in
which evil strait Mr O fought like a very Guy of Warwick and I verily
believe every man of them likewise for there was none of them who had
not his shrewd scratch to show And indeed Mr Oxenhams party had once
gotten within the barricades but the Spaniards being sheltered by
the tree trunks and especially by one mighty tree which stood as I
remembered it and remember it now borne up two fathoms high upon its
own roots as it were upon arches and pillars shot at them with such
advantage that they had several slain and seven more taken alive only
among the roots of that tree So seeing that they could prevail nothing
having little but their pikes and swords they were fain to give back
though Mr Oxenham swore he would not stir a foot and making at the
Spanish captain was borne down with pikes and hardly pulled away by
some who at last reminding him of his lady persuaded him to come away
with the rest Whereon the other party fled also but what had become
of them they knew not for they took another way And so they miserably
drew off having lost in men eleven killed and seven taken alive
besides five of the rascal negroes who were killed before they had time
to run and there was an end of the matter

  In the documents from which I have drawn this veracious
 history a note is appended to this point of Yeos story
 which seems to me to smack sufficiently of the old
 Elizabethan seaman to be inserted at length

 All so far and most after agreeth with Lopez Vaz his
 tale taken from his pocket by my Lord Cumberlands mariners
 at the river Plate in the year 1586 But note here his
 vainglory and falsehood or else fear of the Spaniard

 First lest it should be seen how great an advantage the
 Spaniards had he maketh no mention of the English calivers
 nor those two pieces of ordnance which were in the pinnace

 Second he saith nothing of the flight of the Cimaroons
 though it was evidently to be gathered from that which he
 himself saith that of less than seventy English were slain
 eleven and of the negroes but five And while of the
 English seven were taken alive yet of the negroes none
 And why but because the rascals ran

 Thirdly it is a thing incredible and out of experience
 that eleven English should be slain and seven taken with
 loss only of two Spaniards killed

 Search now and see for I will not speak of mine own small
 doings in all those memorable voyages which the worthy
 and learned Mr Hakluyt hath so painfully collected and
 which are to my old age next only to my Bible whether in
 all the fights which we have endured with the Spaniards
 their loss even in victory hath not far exceeded ours
 For we are both bigger of body and fiercer of spirit being
 even to the poorest of us thanks so the care of our
 illustrious princes the best fed men of Europe the most
 trained to feats of strength and use of weapons and put our
 trust also not in any Virgin or saints dead rags and bones
 painted idols which have no breath in their mouths or St
 Bartholomew medals and such devils remembrancers but in
 the only true God and our Lord Jesus Christ in whom
 whosoever trusteth one of them shall chase a thousand So
 I hold having had good experience and say if they have
 done it once let them do it again and kill their eleven to
 our two with any weapon they will save paper bullets blown
 out of Fames lying trumpet Yet I have no quarrel with the
 poor Portugal for I doubt not but friend Lopez Vaz had
 looking over his shoulder as he wrote some mighty black
 velvet Don with a name as long as that Don Bernaldino
 Delgadillo de Avellaneda who set forth lately his
 vainglorious libel of lies concerning the last and fatal
 voyage of my dear friends Sir F Drake and Sir John Hawkins
 who rest in peace having finished their labors as would
 God I rested To whose shameless and unspeakable lying my
 good friend Mr Henry Savile of this county did most pithily
 and wittily reply stripping the ass out of his lions skin
 and Sir Thomas Baskerville general of the fleet by my
 advice send him a cartel of defiance offering to meet him
 with choice of weapons in any indifferent kingdom of equal
 distance from this realm which challenge he hath prudently
 put in his pipe or rather rolled it up for one of his
 Spanish cigarros and smoked it and I doubt not found it
 foul in the mouth

But the next day gentlemen in came some fiveandtwenty more being
the wreck of the other party and with them a few negroes and these
last proved themselves no honester men than they were brave for there
being great misery among us English and every one of us straggling
where he could to get food every day one or more who went out never
came back and that caused a suspicion that the negroes had betrayed
them to the Spaniards or maybe slain and eaten them So these fellows
being upbraided with that altogether left us telling us boldly
that if they had eaten our fellows we owed them a debt instead of the
Spanish prisoners and we in great terror and hunger went forward and
over the mountains till we came to a little river which ran northward
which seemed to lead into the Northern Sea and there Mr Owho sirs
I will say after his first rage was over behaved himself all through
like a valiant and skilful commanderbade us cut down trees and make
canoes to go down to the sea which we began to do with great labor
and little profit hewing down trees with our swords and burning them
out with fire which after much labor we kindled but as we were
aburning out of the first tree and cutting down of another a great
party of negroes came upon us and with much friendly show bade us flee
for our lives for the Spaniards were upon us in great force And so we
were up and away again hardly able to drag our legs after us for hunger
and weariness and the broiling heat And some were taken God help
them and some fled with the negroes of whom what became God alone
knoweth but eight or ten held on with the captain among whom was I
and fled downward toward the sea for one day but afterwards finding by
the noise in the woods that the Spaniards were on the track of us we
turned up again toward the inland and coming to a cliff climbed up
over it drawing up the lady and the little maid with cords of liana
which hang from those trees as honeysuckle does here but exceeding
stout and long even to fifty fathoms and so breaking the track hoped
to be out of the way of the enemy

By which nevertheless we only increased our misery For two fell from
that cliff as men asleep for very weariness and miserably broke their
bones and others whether by the great toil or sunstrokes or eating
of strange berries fell sick of fluxes and fevers where was no drop
of water but rock of pumice stone as bare as the back of my hand and
full moreover of great cracks black and without bottom over which
we had not strength to lift the sick but were fain to leave them there
aloft in the sunshine like Dives in his torments crying aloud for
a drop of water to cool their tongues and every man a great stinking
vulture or two sitting by him like an ugly black fiend out of the pit
waiting till the poor soul should depart out of the corpse but nothing
could avail and for the dear life we must down again and into the
woods or be burned up alive upon those rocks

So getting down the slope on the farther side we came into the woods
once more and there wandered for many days I know not how many
our shoes being gone and our clothes all rent off us with brakes and
briars And yet how the lady endured all was a marvel to see for she
went barefoot many days and for clothes was fain to wrap herself in Mr
Oxenhams cloak while the little maid went all but naked but ever she
looked still on Mr Oxenham and seemed to take no care as long as he
was by comforting and cheering us all with pleasant words yea and
once sitting down under a great figtree sang us all to sleep with
very sweet music yet waking about midnight I saw her sitting still
upright weeping very bitterly on whom sirs God have mercy for she
was a fair and a brave jewel

And so to make few words of a sad matter at last there were none left
but Mr Oxenham and the lady and the little maid together with me and
William Penberthy of Marazion my good comrade And Mr Oxenham always
led the lady and Penberthy and I carried the little maid And for food
we had fruits such as we could find and water we got from the leaves
of certain lilies which grew on the bark of trees which I found by
seeing the monkeys drink at them and the little maid called them
monkeycups and asked for them continually making me climb for them
And so we wandered on and upward into very high mountains always
fearing lest the Spaniards should track us with dogs which made the
lady leap up often in her sleep crying that the bloodhounds were upon
her And it befell upon a day that we came into a great wood of ferns
which grew not on the ground like ours but on stems as big as a
pinnaces mast and the bark of them was like a fine meshed net very
strange to see where was very pleasant shade cool and green and
there gentlemen we sat down on a bank of moss like folk desperate and
fordone and every one looked the other in the face for a long while
After which I took off the bark of those ferns for I must needs be
doing something to drive away thought and began to plait slippers for
the little maid

And as I was plaiting Mr Oxenham said What hinders us from dying
like men every man falling on his own sword To which I answered that
I dare not for a wise woman had prophesied of me sirs that I should
die at sea and yet neither by water or battle wherefore I did not
think right to meddle with the Lords purposes And William Penberthy
said That he would sell his life and that dear but never give it
away But the lady said Ah how gladly would I die but then la
paouvre garse which is in French the poor maid meaning the little
one Then Mr Oxenham fell into a very great weeping a weakness I never
saw him in before or since and with many tears besought me never
to desert that little maid whatever might befall which I promised
swearing to it like a heathen but would if I had been able have kept
it like a Christian But on a sudden there was a great cry in the
wood and coming through the trees on all sides Spanish arquebusiers
a hundred strong at least and negroes with them who bade us stand
or they would shoot William Penberthy leapt up crying Treason and
running upon the nearest negro ran him through and then another and
then falling on the Spaniards fought manfully till he was borne down
with pikes and so died But I seeing no thing better to do sate
still and finished my plaiting And so we were all taken and I and Mr
Oxenham bound with cords but the soldiers made a litter for the lady
and child by commandment of Senor Diego de Trees their commander a
very courteous gentleman

Well sirs we were brought down to the place where the house of boughs
had been by the riverside there we went over in boats and found
waiting for us certain Spanish gentlemen and among others one old and
illfavored man graybearded and bent in a suit of black velvet who
seemed to be a great man among them And if you will believe me Mr
Leigh that was none other than the old man with the gold falcon at his
breast Don Francisco Xararte by name whom you found aboard of the Lima
ship And had you known as much of him as I do or as Mr Oxenham did
either you had cut him up for sharks bait or ever you let the cur
ashore again

Well sirs as soon as the lady came to shore that old man ran upon
her sword in hand and would have slain her but some there held him
back On which he turned to and reviled with every foul and spiteful
word which he could think of so that some there bade him be silent for
shame and Mr Oxenham said It is worthy of you Don Francisco thus
to trumpet abroad your own disgrace Did I not tell you years ago that
you were a cur and are you not proving my words for me

He answered English dog would to Heaven I had never seen you

And Mr Oxenham Spanish ape would to Heaven that I had sent
my dagger through your herringribs when you passed me behind St
Ildegondes church eight years last Eastereve At which the old man
turned pale and then began again to upbraid the lady vowing that
he would have her burnt alive and other devilish words to which she
answered at last

Would that you had burnt me alive on my wedding morning and spared me
eight years of misery And he

Misery Hear the witch senors Oh have I not pampered her heaped
with jewels clothes coaches what not The saints alone know what I
have spent on her What more would she have of me

To which she answered only but this one word Fool but in so
terrible a voice though low that they who were about to laugh at the
old pantaloon were more minded to weep for her

Fool she said again after a while I will waste no words upon you
I would have driven a dagger to your heart months ago but that I
was loath to set you free so soon from your gout and your rheumatism
Selfish and stupid know when you bought my body from my parents you
did not buy my soul Farewell my love my life and farewell senors
May you be more merciful to your daughters than my parents were to me
And so catching a dagger from the girdle of one of the soldiers smote
herself to the heart and fell dead before them all

At which Mr Oxenham smiled and said That was worthy of us both If
you will unbind my hands senors I shall be most happy to copy so fair
a schoolmistress

But Don Diego shook his head and said

It were well for you valiant senor were I at liberty to do so but
on questioning those of your sailors whom I have already taken I cannot
hear that you have any letters of license either from the queen of
England or any other potentate I am compelled therefore to ask you
whether this is so for it is a matter of life and death

To which Mr Oxenham answered merrily that so it was but that he
was not aware that any potentates license was required to permit a
gentlemans meeting his lady love and that as for the gold which they
had taken if they had never allowed that fresh and fair young May to be
forced into marrying that old January he should never have meddled with
their gold so that was rather their fault than his And added that if
he was to be hanged as he supposed the only favor which he asked for
was a long drop and no priests And all the while gentlemen he still
kept his eyes fixed on the ladys corpse till he was led away with me
while all that stood by God reward them for it lamented openly the
tragical end of those two sinful lovers

And now sirs what befell me after that matters little for I never
saw Captain Oxenham again nor ever shall in this life

He was hanged then

So I heard for certain the next year and with him the gunner and
sundry more but some were given away for slaves to the Spaniards
and may be alive now unless like me they have fallen into the cruel
clutches of the Inquisition For the Inquisition now gentlemen claims
the bodies and souls of all heretics all over the world as the devils
told me with their own lips when I pleaded that I was no Spanish
subject and none that it catches whether peaceable merchants or
shipwrecked mariners but must turn or burn

But how did you get into the Inquisition

Why sir after we were taken we set forth to go down the river again
and the old Don took the little maid with him in one boat and bitterly
she screeched at parting from us and from the poor dead corpse and Mr
Oxenham with Don Diego de Trees in another and I in a third And from
the Spaniards I learnt that we were to be taken down to Lima to the
Viceroy but that the old man lived hard by Panama and was going
straight back to Panama forthwith with the little maid But they said
It will be well for her if she ever gets there for the old man swears
she is none of his and would have left her behind him in the woods
now if Don Diego had not shamed him out of it And when I heard that
seeing that there was nothing but death before me I made up my mind
to escape and the very first night sirs by Gods help I did it
and went southward away into the forest avoiding the tracks of the
Cimaroons till I came to an Indian town And there gentlemen I got
more mercy from heathens than ever I had from Christians for when they
found that I was no Spaniard they fed me and gave me a house and
a wife and a good wife she was to me and painted me all over in
patterns as you see and because I had some knowledge of surgery and
bloodletting and my fleams in my pocket which were worth to me a
fortune I rose to great honor among them though they taught me more of
simples than ever I taught them of surgery So I lived with them merrily
enough being a very heathen like them or indeed worse for they
worshipped their Xemes but I nothing And in time my wife bare me a
child in looking at whose sweet face gentlemen I forgot Mr Oxenham
and his little maid and my oath ay and my native land also Wherefore
it was taken from me else had I lived and died as the beasts which
perish for one night after we were all lain down came a noise outside
the town and I starting up saw armed men and calivers shining in the
moonlight and heard one read in Spanish with a loud voice some fools
sermon after their custom when they hunt the poor Indians how God had
given to St Peter the dominion of the whole earth and St Peter
again the Indies to the Catholic king wherefore if they would all
be baptized and serve the Spaniard they should have some monkeys
allowance or other of more kicks than pence and if not then have
at them with fire and sword but I dare say your worships know that
devilish trick of theirs better than I

I know it man Go on

Wellno sooner were the words spoken than without waiting to hear
what the poor innocents within would answer though that mattered
little for they understood not one word of it what do the villains
but let fly right into the town with their calivers and then rush
in sword in hand killing pellmell all they met one of which shots
gentlemen passing through the doorway and close by me struck my poor
wife to the heart that she never spoke word more I catching up the
babe from her breast tried to run but when I saw the town full of
them and their dogs with them in leashes which was yet worse I knew
all was lost and sat down again by the corpse with the babe on my
knees waiting the end like one stunned and in a dream for now I
thought God from whom I had fled had surely found me out as He did
Jonah and the punishment of all my sins was come Well gentlemen they
dragged me out and all the young men and women and chained us together
by the neck and one catching the pretty babe out of my arms calls
for water and a priest for they had their shavelings with them and no
sooner was it christened than catching the babe by the heels he dashed
out its brainsoh gentlemen gentlemenagainst the ground as if it
had been a kitten and so did they to several more innocents that night
after they had christened them saying it was best for them to go to
heaven while they were still sure thereof and so marched us all for
slaves leaving the old folk and the wounded to die at leisure But when
morning came and they knew by my skin that I was no Indian and by my
speech that I was no Spaniard they began threatening me with torments
till I confessed that I was an Englishman and one of Oxenhams crew
At that says the leader Then you shall to Lima to hang by the side of
your captain the pirate by which I first knew that my poor captain was
certainly gone but alas for me the priest steps in and claims me for
his booty calling me Lutheran heretic and enemy of God and so to
make short a sad story to the Inquisition at Cartagena I went where
what I suffered gentlemen were as disgustful for you to hear as
unmanly for me to complain of but so it was that being twice racked
and having endured the watertorment as best I could I was put to the
scarpines whereof I am as you see somewhat lame of one leg to this
day At which I could abide no more and so wretch that I am denied my
God in hope to save my life which indeed I did but little it profited
me for though I had turned to their superstition I must have two
hundred stripes in the public place and then go to the galleys for
seven years And there gentlemen ofttimes I thought that it had been
better for me to have been burned at once and for all but you know
as well as I what a floating hell of heat and cold hunger and thirst
stripes and toil is every one of those accursed craft In which hell
nevertheless gentlemen I found the road to heavenI had almost said
heaven itself For it fell out by Gods mercy that my next comrade was
an Englishman like myself a young man of Bristol who as he told me
had been some manner of factor on board poor Captain Barkers ship and
had been a preacher among the Anabaptists here in England And oh Sir
Richard Grenville if that man had done for you what he did for me you
would never say a word against those who serve the same Lord because
they dont altogether hold with you For from time to time sir seeing
me altogether despairing and furious like a wild beast in a pit he set
before me in secret earnestly the sweet promises of God in Christwho
says Come to me all ye that are heavy laden and I will refresh
you and though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as
snowtill all that past sinful life of mine looked like a dream when
one awaketh and I forgot all my bodily miseries in the misery of my
soul so did I loathe and hate myself for my rebellion against that
loving God who had chosen me before the foundation of the world and
come to seek and save me when I was lost and falling into very despair
at the burden of my heinous sins knew no peace until I gained sweet
assurance that my Lord had hanged my burden upon His cross and washed
my sinful soul in His most sinless blood Amen

And Sir Richard Grenville said Amen also

But gentlemen if that sweet youth won a soul to Christ he paid
as dearly for it as ever did saint of God For after a three or four
months when I had been all that while in sweet converse with him and
I may say in heaven in the midst of hell there came one night to the
barranco at Lima where we were kept when on shore three black devils
of the Holy Office and carried him off without a word only saying to
me Look that your turn come not next for we hear that you have had
much talk with the villain And at these words I was so struck cold
with terror that I swooned right away and verily if they had taken me
there and then I should have denied my God again for my faith was but
young and weak but instead they left me aboard the galley for a few
months more that was a whole voyage to Panama and back in daily dread
lest I should find myself in their cruel claws againand then nothing
for me but to burn as a relapsed heretic But when we came back to
Lima the officers came on board again and said to me That heretic
has confessed naught against you so we will leave you for this time
but because you have been seen talking with him so much and the Holy
Office suspects your conversion to be but a rotten one you are adjudged
to the galleys for the rest of your life in perpetual servitude

But what became of him asked Amyas

He was burned sir a day or two before we got to Lima and five others
with him at the same stake of whom two were Englishmen old comrades of
mine as I guess

Ah said Amyas we heard of that when we were off Lima and they
said too that there were six more lying still in prison to be burnt
in a few days If we had had our fleet with us as we should have had if
it had not been for John Winter we would have gone in and rescued them
all poor wretches and sacked the town to boot but what could we do
with one ship

Would to God you had sir for the story was true enough and among
them I heard were two young ladies of quality and their confessor
who came to their ends for reproving out of Scripture the filthy and
loathsome living of those parts which as I saw well enough and too
well is liker to Sodom than to a Christian town but God will avenge
His saints and their sins Amen

Amen said Sir Richard but on with thy tale for it is as strange as
ever man heard

Well gentlemen when I heard that I must end my days in that galley I
was for awhile like a madman but in a day or two there came over me I
know not how a full assurance of salvation both for this life and the
life to come such as I had never had before and it was revealed to me
I speak the truth gentlemen before Heaven that now I had been tried
to the uttermost and that my deliverance was at hand

And all the way up to Panama that was after we had laden the
Cacafuogo I cast in my mind how to escape and found no way but just
as I was beginning to lose heart again a door was opened by the Lords
own hand for I know not why we were marched across from Panama to
Nombre which had never happened before and there put all together into
a great barranco close by the quayside shackled as is the fashion to
one long bar that ran the whole length of the house And the very first
night that we were there I looking out of the window spied lying
close aboard of the quay a goodsized caravel well armed and just
loading for sea and the land breeze blew off very strong so that the
sailors were laying out a fresh warp to hold her to the shore And it
came into my mind that if we were aboard of her we should be at sea
in five minutes and looking at the quay I saw all the soldiers who had
guarded us scattered about drinking and gambling and some going into
taverns to refresh themselves after their journey That was just at
sundown and half an hour after in comes the gaoler to take a last look
at us for the night and his keys at his girdle Whereon sirs whether
by madness or whether by the spirit which gave Samson strength to rend
the lion I rose against him as he passed me without forethought or
treachery of any kind chained though I was caught him by the head
and threw him there and then against the wall that he never spoke word
after and then with his keys freed myself and every soul in that
room and bid them follow me vowing to kill any man who disobeyed my
commands They followed as men astounded and leaping out of night into
day and death into life and so aboard that caravel and out of the
harbor the Lord only knows how who blinded the eyes of the idolaters
with no more hurt than a few chanceshot from the soldiers on the quay
But my tale has been overlong already gentlemen

Go on till midnight my good fellow if you will

Well sirs they chose me for captain and a certain Genoese for
lieutenant and away to go I would fain have gone ashore after all and
back to Panama to hear news of the little maid but that would have been
but a fools errand Some wanted to turn pirates but I and the Genoese
too who was a prudent man though an evil one persuaded them to run
for England and get employment in the Netherland wars assuring them
that there would be no safety in the Spanish Main when once our escape
got wind And the more part being of one mind for England we sailed
watering at the Barbadoes because it was desolate and so eastward
toward the Canaries In which voyage what we endured being taken by
long calms by scurvy calentures hunger and thirst no tongue can
tell Many a time were we glad to lay out sheets at night to catch
the dew and suck them in the morning and he that had a noggin of
rainwater out of the scuppers was as much sought to as if he had been
Adelantado of all the Indies till of a hundred and forty poor wretches
a hundred and ten were dead blaspheming God and man and above all
me and the Genoese for taking the Europe voyage as if I had not sins
enough of my own already And last of all when we thought ourselves
safe we were wrecked by southwesters on the coast of Brittany near to
Cape Race from which but nine souls of us came ashore with their lives
and so to Brest where I found a Flushinger who carried me to Falmouth
and so ends my tale in which if I have said one word more or less than
truth I can wish myself no worse than to have it all to undergo a
second time

And his voice as he finished sank from very weariness of soul while
Sir Richard sat opposite him in silence his elbows on the table
his cheeks on his doubled fists looking him through and through with
kindling eyes No one spoke for several minutes and then

Amyas you have heard this story You believe it

Every word sir or I should not have the heart of a Christian man

So do I Anthony

The butler entered

Take this man to the buttery clothe him comfortably and feed him with
the best and bid the knaves treat him as if he were their own father

But Yeo lingered

If I might be so bold as to ask your worship a favor

Anything in reason my brave fellow

If your worship could put me in the way of another adventure to the
Indies

Another Hast not had enough of the Spaniards already

Never enough sir while one of the idolatrous tyrants is left
unhanged said he with a right bitter smile But its not for that
only sir but my little maidOh sir my little maid that I swore to
Mr Oxenham to look to and never saw her from that day to this I must
find her sir or I shall go mad I believe Not a night but she comes
and calls to me in my dreams the poor darling and not a morning but
when I wake there is my oath lying on my soul like a great black cloud
and I no nearer the keeping of it I told that poor young minister of it
when we were in the galleys together and he said oaths were oaths and
keep it I must and keep it I will sir if youll but help me

Have patience man God will take as good care of thy little maid as
ever thou wilt

I know it sir I know it but faiths weak sir and oh if she were
bred up a Papist and an idolater wouldnt her blood be on my head then
sir Sooner than that sooner than that Id be in the Inquisition again
tomorrow I would

My good fellow there are no adventures to the Indies forward now but
if you want to fight Spaniards here is a gentleman will show you the
way Amyas take him with you to Ireland If he has learnt half the
lessons God has set him to learn he ought to stand you in good stead

Yeo looked eagerly at the young giant

Will you have me sir Theres few matters I cant turn my hand to
and maybe youll be going to the Indies again some day eh and take me
with you Id serve your turn well though I say it either for gunner
or for pilot I know every stone and tree from Nombre to Panama and all
the ports of both the seas Youll never be content Ill warrant till
youve had another turn along the gold coasts will you now

Amyas laughed and nodded and the bargain was concluded

So out went Yeo to eat and Amyas having received his despatches got
ready for his journey home

Go the short way over the moors lad and send back Carys gray when
you can You must not lose an hour but be ready to sail the moment the
wind goes about

So they started but as Amyas was getting into the saddle he saw that
there was some stir among the servants who seemed to keep carefully out
of Yeos way whispering and nodding mysteriously and just as his foot
was in the stirrup Anthony the old butler plucked him back

Dear father alive Mr Amyas whispered he and you bent going by
the moor road all alone with that chap

Why not then Im too big for him to eat I reckon

Oh Mr Amyas hes not right I tell you not company for a
Christianto go forth with creatures as has flames of fire in their
inwards tis temptation of Providence indeed then it is

Tale of a tub

Tale of a Christian sir There was two boys pigminding seed him at
it down the hill beside a maiden that was taken mazed and no wonder
poor soul and lying in screeching asterisks now down to the millyou
ask as you go byand saw the flames come out of the mouth of mun and
the smoke out of muns nose like a viredrake and the roaring of mun
like the roaring of ten thousand bulls Oh sir and to go with he after
dark over moor Tis the devils devices sir against you because
youm going against his sarvants the Pope of Room and the Spaniard and
youll be Pixyled sure as life and locked into a bog you will and
see mun vanish away to fire and brimstone like a jackolantern Oh
have a care then have a care

And the old man wrung his hands while Amyas bursting with laughter
rode off down the park with the unconscious Yeo at his stirrup
chatting away about the Indies and delighting Amyas more and more by
his shrewdness high spirit and rough eloquence

They had gone ten miles or more the day began to draw in and the
western wind to sweep more cold and cheerless every moment when Amyas
knowing that there was not an inn hard by around for many a mile ahead
took a pull at a certain bottle which Lady Grenville had put into his
holster and then offered Yeo a pull also

He declined he had meat and drink too about him Heaven be praised

Meat and drink Fall to then man and dont stand on manners

Whereon Yeo seeing an old decayed willow by a brook went to it and
took therefrom some touchwood to which he set a light with his knife
and a stone while Amyas watched a little puzzled and startled
as Yeos fiery reputation came into his mind Was he really a
salamandersprite and going to warm his inside by a meal of burning
tinder But now Yeo in his solemn methodical way pulled out of his
bosom a brown leaf and began rolling a piece of it up neatly to the
size of his little finger and then putting the one end into his mouth
and the other on the tinder sucked at it till it was alight and
drinking down the smoke began puffing it out again at his nostrils with
a grunt of deepest satisfaction and resumed his dogtrot by Amyass
side as if he had been a walking chimney

On which Amyas burst into a loud laugh and cried

Why no wonder they said you breathed fire Is not that the Indians
tobacco

Yea verily Heaven be praised but did you never see it before

Never though we heard talk of it along the coast but we took it for
one more Spanish lie Humphwell live and learn

Ah sir no lie but a blessed truth as I can tell who have ere now
gone in the strength of this weed three days and nights without eating
and therefore sir the Indians always carry it with them on their
warparties and no wonder for when all things were made none was made
better than this to be a lone mans companion a bachelors friend
a hungry mans food a sad mans cordial a wakeful mans sleep and a
chilly mans fire sir while for stanching of wounds purging of rheum
and settling of the stomach theres no herb like unto it under the
canopy of heaven

The truth of which eulogium Amyas tested in after years as shall be
fully set forth in due place and time But Mark in the meanwhile says
one of the veracious chroniclers from whom I draw these facts writing
seemingly in the palmy days of good Queen Anne and not having as he
says before his eyes the fear of that misocapnic Solomon James I or
of any other lying Stuart that not to South Devon but to North not
to Sir Walter Raleigh but to Sir Amyas Leigh not to the banks of Dart
but to the banks of Torridge does Europe owe the dayspring of the
latter age that age of smoke which shall endure and thrive when the
age of brass shall have vanished like those of iron and of gold for
whereas Mr Lane is said to have brought home that divine weed as
Spenser well names it from Virginia in the year 1584 it is hereby
indisputable that full four years earlier by the bridge of Putford in
the Torridge moors which all true smokers shall hereafter visit as a
hallowed spot and point of pilgrimage first twinkled that fiery beacon
and beneficent lodestar of Bidefordian commerce to spread hereafter
from port to port and peak to peak like the watchfires which
proclaimed the coming of the Armada or the fall of Troy even to the
shores of the Bosphorus the peaks of the Caucasus and the farthest
isles of the Malayan sea while Bideford metropolis of tobacco saw her
Pool choked with Virginian traders and the pavement of her Bridgeland
Street groaning beneath the savory bales of roll Trinadado leaf and
pudding and her grave burghers bolstered and blocked out of their own
houses by the scarce less savory stockfish casks which filled cellar
parlor and attic were fain to sit outside the door a silver pipe
in every strong right hand and each left hand chinking cheerfully the
doubloons deep lodged in the auriferous caverns of their trunkhose
while in those fairyrings of fragrant mist which circled round their
contemplative brows flitted most pleasant visions of Wiltshire farmers
jogging into Sherborne fair their heaviest shillings in their pockets
to buy unless old Aubrey lies the lotusleaf of Torridge for its
weight in silver and draw from thence after the example of the
Caciques of Dariena supplies of inspiration much needed then as now
in those Gothamite regions And yet did these improve as Englishmen
upon the method of those heathen savages for the latter so Salvation
Yeo reported as a truth and Dampiers surgeon Mr Wafer after him
when they will deliberate of war or policy sit round in the hut of the
chief where being placed enter to them a small boy with a cigarro of
the bigness of a rollingpin and puffs the smoke thereof into the face
of each warrior from the eldest to the youngest while they putting
their hand funnelwise round their mouths draw into the sinuosities of
the brain that more than Delphic vapor of prophecy which boy presently
falls down in a swoon and being dragged out by the heels and laid by to
sober enter another to puff at the sacred cigarro till he is dragged
out likewise and so on till the tobacco is finished and the seed of
wisdom has sprouted in every soul into the tree of meditation bearing
the flowers of eloquence and in due time the fruit of valiant action
With which quaint fact for fact it is in spite of the bombast I end
the present chapter



CHAPTER VIII

HOW THE NOBLE BROTHERHOOD OF THE ROSE WAS FOUNDED

 It is virtue yea virtue gentlemen that maketh gentlemen that
 maketh the poor rich the baseborn noble the subject a sovereign
 the deformed beautiful the sick whole the weak strong the most
 miserable most happy There are two principal and peculiar gifts
 in the nature of man knowledge and reason the one commandeth and
 the other obeyeth these things neither the whirling wheel of
 fortune can change neither the deceitful cavillings of worldlings
 separate neither sickness abate neither age abolishLILLYs
 Euphues 1586

It now falls to my lot to write of the foundation of that most
chivalrous brotherhood of the Rose which after a few years made itself
not only famous in its native country of Devon but formidable as will
be related hereafter both in Ireland and in the Netherlands in the
Spanish Main and the heart of South America And if this chapter shall
seem to any Quixotic and fantastical let them recollect that the
generation who spoke and acted thus in matters of love and honor were
nevertheless practised and valiant soldiers and prudent and crafty
politicians that he who wrote the Arcadia was at the same time in
spite of his youth one of the subtlest diplomatists of Europe that
the poet of the Faerie Queene was also the author of The State
of Ireland and if they shall quote against me with a sneer Lillys
Euphues itself I shall only answer by askingHave they ever read
it For if they have done so I pity them if they have not found it in
spite of occasional tediousness and pedantry as brave righteous and
pious a book as man need look into and wish for no better proof of
the nobleness and virtue of the Elizabethan age than the fact that
Euphues and the Arcadia were the two popular romances of the day It
may have suited the purposes of Sir Walter Scott in his cleverly drawn
Sir Piercie Shafton to ridicule the Euphuists and that affectatam
comitatem of the travelled English of which Languet complains but over
and above the anachronism of the whole character for to give but one
instance the Euphuist knight talks of Sidneys quarrel with Lord Oxford
at least ten years before it happened we do deny that Lillys book
could if read by any man of common sense produce such a coxcomb
whose spiritual ancestors would rather have been Gabriel Harvey and
Lord Oxfordif indeed the former has not maligned the latter and
illtempered Tom Nash maligned the maligner in his turn

But indeed there is a double anachronism in Sir Piercie for he does
not even belong to the days of Sidney but to those worse times which
began in the latter years of Elizabeth and after breaking her mighty
heart had full license to bear their crop of fools heads in the
profligate days of James Of them perhaps hereafter And in the
meanwhile let those who have not read Euphues believe that if they
could train a son after the fashion of his Ephoebus to the great
saving of their own money and his virtue all fathers even in these
moneymaking days would rise up and call them blessed Let us
rather open our eyes and see in these old Elizabeth gallants our own
ancestors showing forth with the luxuriant wildness of youth all the
virtues which still go to the making of a true Englishman Let us not
only see in their commercial and military daring in their political
astuteness in their deep reverence for law and in their solemn sense
of the great calling of the English nation the antitypes or rather
the examples of our own but let us confess that their chivalry is only
another garb of that beautiful tenderness and mercy which is now as
it was then the twin sister of English valor and even in their
extravagant fondness for Continental manners and literature let us
recognize that old AngloNorman teachableness and wideheartedness
which has enabled us to profit by the wisdom and civilization of all
ages and of all lands without prejudice to our own distinctive national
character

And so I go to my story which if any one dislikes he has but to turn
the leaf till he finds pasturage which suits him better

Amyas could not sail the next day or the day after for the southwester
freshened and blew three parts of a gale dead into the bay So having
got the Mary Grenville down the river into Appledore pool ready to
start with the first shift of wind he went quietly home and when
his mother started on a pillion behind the old servingman to ride
to Clovelly where Frank lay wounded he went in with her as far as
Bideford and there met coming down the High Street a procession of
horsemen headed by Will Cary who clad capapie in a shining armor
sword on thigh and helmet at saddlebow looked as gallant a young
gentleman as ever Bideford dames peeped at from door and window Behind
him upon country ponies came four or five stout servingmen carrying
his lances and baggage and their own longbows swords and bucklers
and behind all in a horselitter to Mrs Leighs great joy Master
Frank himself He deposed that his wounds were only fleshwounds the
dagger having turned against his ribs that he must see the last of
his brother and that with her good leave he would not come home to
Burrough but take up his abode with Cary in the Ship Tavern close to
the Bridgefoot This he did forthwith and settling himself on a couch
held his levee there in state mobbed by all the gossips of the town
not without white fibs as to who had brought him into that sorry plight

But in the meanwhile he and Amyas concocted a scheme which was put
into effect the next day being marketday first by the innkeeper who
began under Amyass orders a bustle of roasting boiling and frying
unparalleled in the annals of the Ship Tavern and next by Amyas
himself who going out into the market invited as many of his old
schoolfellows one by one apart as Frank had pointed out to him to a
merry supper and a rowse thereon consequent by which crafty scheme
in came each of Rose Salternes gentle admirers and found himself to
his considerable disgust seated at the same table with six rivals to
none of whom had he spoken for the last six months However all were
too well bred to let the Leighs discern as much and they though of
course they knew all settled their guests Frank on his couch lying
at the head of the table and Amyas taking the bottom and contrived by
filling all mouths with good things to save them the pain of speaking
to each other till the wine should have loosened their tongues and
warmed their hearts In the meanwhile both Amyas and Frank ignoring the
silence of their guests with the most provoking goodhumor chatted
and joked and told stories and made themselves such good company that
Will Cary who always found merriment infectious melted into a jest
and then into another and finding goodhumor far more pleasant than
bad tried to make Mr Coffin laugh and only made him bow and to
make Mr Fortescue laugh and only made him frown and unabashed
nevertheless began playing his light artillery upon the waiters till
he drove them out of the room bursting with laughter

So far so good And when the cloth was drawn and sack and sugar became
the order of the day and Queen and Bible had been duly drunk with all
the honors Frank tried a fresh move and

I have a toast gentlemenhere it is The gentlemen of the Irish
wars and may Ireland never be without a St Leger to stand by a
Fortescue a Fortescue to stand by a St Leger and a Chichester to
stand by both

Which toast of course involved the drinking the healths of the three
representatives of those families and their returning thanks and
paying a compliment each to the others house and so the ice cracked a
little further and young Fortescue proposed the health of Amyas Leigh
and all bold mariners to which Amyas replied by a few blunt kindly
words that he wished to know no better fortune than to sail round the
world again with the present company as fellowadventurers and so give
the Spaniards another taste of the men of Devon

And by this time the wine going down sweetly caused the lips of them
that were asleep to speak till the ice broke up altogether and every
man began talking like a rational Englishman to the man who sat next
him

And now gentlemen said Frank who saw that it was the fit moment
for the grand assault which he had planned all along let me give you
a health which none of you I dare say will refuse to drink with heart
and soul as well as with lipsthe health of one whom beauty and virtue
have so ennobled that in their light the shadow of lowly birth
is unseenthe health of one whom I would proclaim as peerless in
loveliness were it not that every gentleman here has sisters who might
well challenge from her the girdle of Venus and yet what else dare
I say while those same lovely ladies who if they but use their own
mirrors must needs be far better judges of beauty than I can be have
in my own hearing again and again assigned the palm to her Surely if
the goddesses decide among themselves the question of the golden apple
Paris himself must vacate the judgmentseat Gentlemen your hearts I
doubt not have already bid you as my unworthy lips do now to drink
The Rose of Torridge

If the Rose of Torridge herself had walked into the room she could
hardly have caused more blank astonishment than Franks bold speech
Every guest turned red and pale and red again and looked at the other
as much as to say What right has any one but I to drink her Lift
your glass and I will dash it out of your hand but Frank with sweet
effrontery drank The health of the Rose of Torridge and a double
health to that worthy gentleman whosoever he may be whom she is fated
to honor with her love

Well done cunning Frank Leigh cried blunt Will Cary none of us
dare quarrel with you now however much we may sulk at each other For
theres none of us Ill warrant but thinks that she likes him the best
of all and so we are bound to believe that you have drunk our healths
all round

And so I have and what better thing can you do gentlemen than to
drink each others healths all round likewise and so show yourselves
true gentlemen true Christians ay and true lovers For what is love
let me speak freely to you gentlemen and guests what is love but
the very inspiration of that Deity whose name is Love Be sure that not
without reason did the ancients feign Eros to be the eldest of the gods
by whom the jarring elements of chaos were attuned into harmony and
order How then shall lovers make him the father of strife Shall
Psyche wed with Cupid to bring forth a cockatrices egg or the soul be
filled with love the likeness of the immortals to burn with envy and
jealousy division and distrust True the rose has its thorn but it
leaves poison and stings to the nettle Cupid has his arrow but he
hurls no scorpions Venus is awful when despised as the daughters of
Proetus found but her handmaids are the Graces not the Furies Surely
he who loves aright will not only find love lovely but become himself
lovely also I speak not to reprehend you gentlemen for to you as
your piercing wits have already perceived to judge by your honorable
blushes my discourse tends but to point you if you will but permit
me to that rock which I myself have I know not by what Divine good
hap attained if indeed I have attained it and am not about to be
washed off again by the next tide

Franks rapid and fantastic oratory utterly unexpected as it was had
as yet left their wits no time to set their tempers on fire but when
weak from his wounds he paused for breath there was a haughty
murmur from more than one young gentleman who took his speech as
an impertinent interference with each mans right to make a fool of
himself and Mr Coffin who had sat quietly bolt upright and looking
at the opposite wall now rose as quietly and with a face which tried
to look utterly unconcerned was walking out of the room another
minute and Lady Baths prophecy about the feast of the Lapithae might
have come true

But Franks heart and head never failed him

Mr Coffin said he in a tone which compelled that gentleman to turn
round and so brought him under the power of a face which none could
have beheld for five minutes and borne malice so imploring tender
earnest was it My dear Mr Coffin If my earnestness has made me
forget even for a moment the bounds of courtesy let me entreat you to
forgive me Do not add to my heavy griefs heavy enough already the
grief of losing a friend Only hear me patiently to the end generously
I know you will hear me and then if you are still incensed I can
but again entreat your forgiveness a second time

Mr Coffin to tell the truth had at that time never been to Court and
he was therefore somewhat jealous of Frank and his Court talk and his
Court clothes and his Court company and moreover being the eldest
of the guests and only two years younger than Frank himself he was a
little nettled at being classed in the same category with some who were
scarce eighteen And if Frank had given the least hint which seemed
to assume his own superiority all had been lost but when instead
thereof he sued in forma pauperis and threw himself upon Coffins
mercy the latter who was a truehearted man enough and after all had
known Frank ever since either of them could walk had nothing to do but
to sit down again and submit while Frank went on more earnestly than
ever

Believe me believe me Mr Coffin and gentlemen all I no more
arrogate to myself a superiority over you than does the sailor hurled
on shore by the surge fancy himself better than his comrade who is still
battling with the foam For I too gentlemenlet me confess it that
by confiding in you I may perhaps win you to confide in mehave
loved ay and do love where you love also Do not start Is it a matter
of wonder that the sun which has dazzled you has dazzled me that
the lodestone which has drawn you has drawn me Do not frown either
gentlemen I have learnt to love you for loving what I love and to
admire you for admiring that which I admire Will you not try the same
lesson so easy and when learnt so blissful What breeds more close
communion between subjects than allegiance to the same queen between
brothers than duty to the same father between the devout than
adoration for the same Deity And shall not worship for the same beauty
be likewise a bond of love between the worshippers and each lover see
in his rival not an enemy but a fellowsufferer You smile and say in
your hearts that though all may worship but one can enjoy and that
one mans meat must be the poison of the rest Be it so though I deny
it Shall we anticipate our own doom and slay ourselves for fear of
dying Shall we make ourselves unworthy of her from our very eagerness
to win her and show ourselves her faithful knights by cherishing
envymost unknightly of all sins Shall we dream with the Italian
or the Spaniard that we can become more amiable in a ladys eyes by
becoming hateful in the eyes of God and of each other Will she love
us the better if we come to her with hands stained in the blood of
him whom she loves better than us Let us recollect ourselves rather
gentlemen and be sure that our only chance of winning her if she be
worth winning is to will what she wills honor whom she honors love
whom she loves If there is to be rivalry among us let it be a rivalry
in nobleness an emulation in virtue Let each try to outstrip the other
in loyalty to his queen in valor against her foes in deeds of courtesy
and mercy to the afflicted and oppressed and thus our love will indeed
prove its own divine origin by raising us nearer to those gods whose
gift it is But yet I show you a more excellent way and that is
charity Why should we not make this common love to her whom I am
unworthy to name the sacrament of a common love to each other Why
should we not follow the heroical examples of those ancient knights who
having but one grief one desire one goddess held that one heart was
enough to contain that grief to nourish that desire to worship that
divinity and so uniting themselves in friendship till they became but
one soul in two bodies lived only for each other in living only for
her vowing as faithful worshippers to abide by her decision to find
their own bliss in hers and whomsoever she esteemed most worthy of
her love to esteem most worthy also and count themselves by that her
choice the bounden servants of him whom their mistress had condescended
to advance to the dignity of her masteras I not without hope that I
shall be outdone in generous strife do here promise to be the faithful
friend and to my ability the hearty servant of him who shall be
honored with the love of the Rose of Torridge

He ceased and there was a pause

At last young Fortescue spoke

I may be paying you a lefthanded compliment sir but it seems to me
that you are so likely in that case to become your own faithful friend
and hearty servant even if you have not borne off the bell already
while we have been asleep that the bargain is hardly fair between such
a gay Italianist and us country swains

You undervalue yourself and your country my dear sir But set your
mind at rest I know no more of that ladys mind than you do nor shall
I know For the sake of my own peace I have made a vow neither to see
her nor to hear if possible tidings of her till three full years are
past Dixi

Mr Coffin rose

Gentlemen I may submit to be outdone by Mr Leigh in eloquence but
not in generosity if he leaves these parts for three years I do so
also

And go in charity with all mankind said Cary Give us your hand
old fellow If you are a Coffin you were sawn out of no wishywashy
elmboard but right heartofoak I am going too as Amyas here can
tell to Ireland away to cool my hot liver in a bog like a Jackhare
in March Come give us thy neif and let us part in peace I was minded
to have fought thee this day

I should have been most happy sir said Coffin

But now I am all love and charity to mankind Can I have the pleasure
of begging pardon of the world in general and thee in particular Does
any one wish to pull my nose send me an errand make me lend him five
pounds ay make me buy a horse of him which will be as good as giving
him ten Come along Join hands all round and swear eternal friendship
as brothers of the sacred order of theof what Frank Leigh Open thy
mouth Daniel and christen us

The Rose said Frank quietly seeing that his new lovephiltre was
working well and determined to strike while the iron was hot and carry
the matter too far to carry it back again

The Rose cried Cary catching hold of Coffins hand with his right
and Fortescues with his left Come Mr Coffin Bend sturdy oak Woe
to the stiffnecked and stouthearted says Scripture

And somehow or other whether it was Franks chivalrous speech or
Carys fun or Amyass good wine or the nobleness which lies in every
young lads heart if their elders will take the trouble to call it out
the whole party came in to terms one by one shook hands all round and
vowed on the hilt of Amyass sword to make fools of themselves no more
at least by jealousy but to stand by each other and by their ladylove
and neither grudge nor grumble let her dance with flirt with or marry
with whom she would and in order that the honor of their peerless dame
and the brotherhood which was named after her might be spread through
all lands and equal that of Angelica or Isonde of Brittany they would
each go home and ask their fathers leave easy enough to obtain in
those brave times to go abroad wheresoever there were good wars to
emulate there the courage and the courtesy of Walter Manny and Gonzalo
Fernandes Bayard and Gaston de Foix Why not Sidney was the hero of
Europe at fiveandtwenty and why not they

And Frank watched and listened with one of his quiet smiles his eyes
as some folks do smiled even when his lips were still and only said
Gentlemen be sure that you will never repent this day

Repent said Cary I feel already as angelical as thou lookest Saint
Silvertongue What was it that sneezedthe cat

The lion rather by the roar of it said Amyas making a dash at the
arras behind him Why here is a doorway here and

And rushing under the arras through an open door behind he returned
dragging out by the head Mr John Brimblecombe

Who was Mr John Brimblecombe

If you have forgotten him you have done pretty nearly what every one
else in the room had done But you recollect a certain fat lad son of
the schoolmaster whom Sir Richard punished for talebearing three years
before by sending him not to Coventry but to Oxford That was the
man He was now oneandtwenty and a bachelor of Oxford where he
had learnt such things as were taught in those days with more or less
success and he was now hanging about Bideford once more intending to
return after Christmas and read divinity that he might become a parson
and a shepherd of souls in his native land

Jack was in person exceedingly like a pig but not like every pig not
in the least like the Devon pigs of those days which I am sorry to
say were no more shapely than the true Irish greyhound who pays
Pats rint for him or than the lanky monsters who wallow in German
rivulets while the village swineherd beneath a shady lime forgets his
fleas in the melody of a Jews harpstrange mudcolored creatures four
feet high and four inches thick which look as if they had passed their
lives as a collar of Oxford brawn is said to do between two tight
boards Such were then the pigs of Devon not to be compared with the
true wild descendant of Noahs stock highwithered furry grizzled
gameflavored little rooklers whereof many a sownder still grunted
about Swinley down and Braunton woods Clovelly glens and Bursdon moor
Not like these nor like the tame abomination of those barbarous times
was Jack but prophetic in face figure and complexion of Fisher Hobbs
and the triumphs of science A Fisher Hobbs pig of twelve stone on
his hindlegsthat was what he was and nothing else and if you do not
know reader what a Fisher Hobbs is you know nothing about pigs
and deserve no bacon for breakfast But such was Jack The same plump
mulberry complexion garnished with a few scattered black bristles the
same sleek skin looking always as if it was upon the point of bursting
the same little toddling legs the same dapper bend in the small of the
back the same cracked squeak the same low upright forehead and tiny
eyes the same round selfsatisfied jowl the same charming sensitive
little cocked nose always on the lookout for a savory smelland
yet while watching for the best contented with the worst a pig of
selfhelpful and serene spirit as Jack was and therefore like him
fatting fast while other pigs ribs are staring through their skins

Such was Jack and lucky it was for him that such he was for it was
little that he got to fat him at Oxford in days when a servitor meant
really a servantstudent and wistfully that day did his eyes led by
his nose survey at the end of the Ship Inn passage the preparations
for Amyass supper The innkeeper was a friend of his for in the first
place they had lived within three doors of each other all their lives
and next Jack was quite pleasant company enough beside being a
learned man and an Oxford scholar to be asked in now and then to the
innkeepers private parlor when there were no gentlemen there to
crack his little joke and tell his little story sip the leavings of the
guests sack and sometimes help the host to eat the leavings of their
supper And it was perhaps with some such hope that Jack trotted off
round the corner to the Ship that very afternoon for that faithful
little nose of his as it sniffed out of a back window of the school
had given him warning of Sabean gales and scents of Paradise from the
inn kitchen below so he went round and asked for his pot of small ale
his only luxury and stood at the bar to drink it and looked inward
with his little twinkling right eye and sniffed inward with his little
curling right nostril and beheld in the kitchen beyond salad in
stacks and fagots salad of lettuce salad of cress and endive salad of
boiled coleworts salad of pickled coleworts salad of angelica salad
of scurvywort and seven salads more for potatoes were not as yet and
salads were during eight months of the year the only vegetable And on
the dresser and before the fire whole hecatombs of fragrant victims
which needed neither frankincense nor myrrh Clovelly herrings and
Torridge salmon Exmoor mutton and Stow venison stubble geese and
woodcocks curlew and snipe hams of Hampshire chitterlings of Taunton
and botargos of Cadiz such as Pantagruel himself might have devoured
And Jack eyed them as a ragged boy eyes the cakes in a pastrycooks
window and thought of the scraps from the commoners dinner which were
his wages for cleaning out the hall and meditated deeply on the unequal
distribution of human bliss

Ah Mr Brimblecombe said the host bustling out with knife and apron
to cool himself in the passage Here are doings Nine gentlemen to
supper

Nine Are they going to eat all that

Well I cant saythat Mr Amyas is as good as three to his trencher
but still theres crumbs Mr Brimblecombe crumbs and waste not
want not is my doctrine so you and I may have a somewhat to stay our
stomachs about an eight oclock

Eight said Jack looking wistfully at the clock Its but four now
Well its kind of you and perhaps Ill look in

Just you step in now and look to this venison Theres a breast you
may lay your two fingers into the say there and not get to the bottom
of the fat Thats Sir Richards sending Hes all for them Leighs and
no wonder theym brave lads surely and theres a saddleomutton I
rode twenty miles for mun yesterday I did over beyond Barnstaple and
five year old Mr John it is if ever five years was and not a tooth
to muns head for I looked to that and smelt all the way home like any
apple and if it dont ate so soft as ever was scald cream never you
call me Thomas Burman

Humph said Jack And thats their dinner Well some are born with a
silver spoon in their mouth

Some be born with roast beef in their mouths and plumpudding in
their pocket to take away the taste o mun and thats better than empty
spunes eh

For them that get it said Jack But for them that dont And with
a sigh he returned to his small ale and then lingered in and out of the
inn watching the dinner as it went into the best room where the guests
were assembled

And as he lounged there Amyas went in and saw him and held out his
hand and said

Hillo Jack how goes the world How youve grown and passed
onwhat had Jack Brimblecombe to do with Rose Salterne

So Jack lingered on hovering around the fragrant smell like a fly round
a honeypot till he found himself invisibly attracted and as it were
led by the nose out of the passage into the adjoining room and to that
side of the room where there was a door and once there he could not
help hearing what passed inside till Rose Salternes name fell on his
ear So as it was ordained he was taken in the fact And now behold
him brought in redhand to judgment not without a kick or two from
the wrathful foot of Amyas Leigh Whereat there fell on him a storm of
abuse which for the honor of that gallant company I shall not give in
detail but which abuse strange to say seemed to have no effect on the
impenitent and unabashed Jack who as soon as he could get his breath
made answer fiercely amid much puffing and blowing

What business have I here As much as any of you If you had asked me
in I would have come but as you didnt I came without asking

You shameless rascal said Cary Come if you were asked where there
was good wine Ill warrant you for that

Why said Amyas no lad ever had a cake at school but he would
dog him up one street and down another all day for the crumbs the
trencherscraping spaniel

Patience masters said Frank That Jacks is somewhat of a gnathonic
and parasitic soul or stomach all Bideford applewomen know but I
suspect more than Deus Venter has brought him hither

Deus eavesdropping then We shall have the whole story over the town
by tomorrow said another beginning at that thought to feel somewhat
ashamed of his late enthusiasm

Ah Mr Frank You were always the only one that would stand up for me
Deus Venter quotha Twas Deus Cupid it was

A roar of laughter followed this announcement

What asked Frank was it Cupid then who sneezed approval to our
love Jack as he did to that of Dido and Aeneas

But Jack went on desperately

I was in the next room drinking of my beer I couldnt help that
could I And then I heard her name and I couldnt help listening then
Flesh and blood couldnt

Nor fat either

No nor fat Mr Cary Do you suppose fat men havent souls to be saved
as well as thin ones and hearts to burst too as well as stomachs
Fat Fat can feel I reckon as well as lean Do you suppose theres
naught inside here but beer

And he laid his hand as Drayton might have said on that stout bastion
hornwork ravelin or demilune which formed the outworks to the citadel
of his purple isle of man

Naught but beerCheese I suppose

Bread

Beef

Love cried Jack Yes LoveAy you laugh but my eyes are not so
grown up with fat but what I can see whats fair as well as you

Oh Jack naughty Jack dost thou heap sin on sin and luxury on
gluttony

Sin If I sin you sin I tell you and I dont care who knows it Ive
loved her these three years as well as eer a one of you I have Ive
thought o nothing else prayed for nothing else God forgive me And
then you laugh at me because Im a poor parsons son and you fine
gentlemen God made us both I reckon Youyou make a deal of giving
her up today Why its what Ive done for three miserable years as
ever poor sinner spent ay from the first day I said to myself Jack
if you cant have that pearl youll have none and that you cant
have for its meat for your masters so conquer or die And I couldnt
conquer I cant help loving her worshipping her no more than you and
I will die but you neednt laugh meanwhile at me that have done as much
as you and will do again

It is the old tale said Frank to himself whom will not love
transform into a hero

And so it was Jacks squeaking voice was firm and manly his pigs
eyes flashed very fire his gestures were so free and earnest that the
ungainliness of his figure was forgotten and when he finished with
a violent burst of tears Frank forgetting his wounds sprang up and
caught him by the hand

John Brimblecombe forgive me Gentlemen if we are gentlemen we
ought to ask his pardon Has he not shown already more chivalry more
selfdenial and therefore more true love than any of us My friends
let the fierceness of affection which we have used as an excuse for
many a sin of our own excuse his listening to a conversation in which
he well deserved to bear a part

Ah said Jack you make me one of your brotherhood and see if I do
not dare to suffer as much as any of you You laugh Do you fancy none
can use a sword unless he has a bakers dozen of quarterings in his
arms or that Oxford scholars know only how to handle a pen

Let us try his metal said St Leger Heres my sword Jack draw
Coffin and have at him

Nonsense said Coffin looking somewhat disgusted at the notion of
fighting a man of Jacks rank but Jack caught at the weapon offered to
him

Give me a buckler and have at any of you

Heres a chair bottom cried Cary and Jack seizing it in his left
flourished his sword so fiercely and called so loudly to Coffin to come
on that all present found it necessary unless they wished blood to be
spilt to turn the matter off with a laugh but Jack would not hear of
it

Nay if you will let me be of your brotherhood well and good but if
not one or other I will fight and thats flat

You see gentlemen said Amyas we must admit him or die the death
so we needs must go when Sir Urian drives Come up Jack and take the
oaths You admit him gentlemen

Let me but be your chaplain said Jack and pray for your luck when
youre at the wars If I do stay at home in a country curacy tis not
much that you need be jealous of me with her I reckon said Jack with
a pathetical glance at his own stomach

Sia said Cary but if he be admitted it must be done according to
the solemn forms and ceremonies in such cases provided Take him into
the next room Amyas and prepare him for his initiation

Whats that asked Amyas puzzled by the word But judging from the
corner of Wills eye that initiation was Latin for a practical joke
he led forth his victim behind the arras again and waited five minutes
while the room was being darkened till Franks voice called to him to
bring in the neophyte

John Brimblecombe said Frank in a sepulchral tone you cannot be
ignorant as a scholar and bachelor of Oxford of that dread sacrament
by which Catiline bound the soul of his fellowconspirators in order
that both by the daring of the deed he might have proof of their
sincerity and by the horror thereof astringe their souls by adamantine
fetters and NovemStygian oaths to that wherefrom hereafter the
weakness of the flesh might shrink Wherefore O Jack we too have
determined following that ancient and classical example to fill as he
did a bowl with the lifeblood of our most heroic selves and to pledge
each other therein with vows whereat the stars shall tremble in their
spheres and Luna blushing veil her silver cheeks Your blood alone is
wanted to fill up the goblet Sit down John Brimblecombe and bare your
arm

But Mr Frank said Jack who was as superstitious as any old
wife and what with the darkness and the discourse already in a cold
perspiration

But me no buts or depart as recreant not by the door like a man but
up the chimney like a flittermouse

But Mr Frank

Thy vital juice or the chimney Choose roared Cary in his ear

Well if I must said Jack but its desperate hard that because you
cant keep faith without these barbarous oaths I must take them too
that have kept faith these three years without any

At this pathetic appeal Frank nearly melted but Amyas and Cary had
thrust the victim into a chair and all was prepared for the sacrifice

Bind his eyes according to the classic fashion said Will

Oh no dear Mr Cary Ill shut them tight enough I warrant but not
with your dagger dear Mr Williamsure not with your dagger I cant
afford to lose blood though I do look lustyI cant indeed sure a
pin would doIve got one here to my sleeve somewhereOh

See the fount of generous juice Flow on fair stream How he
bleedspints quarts Ah this proves him to be in earnest

A true lovers blood is always at his fingers ends

He does not grudge it of course not Eh Jack What matters an odd
gallon for her sake

For her sake Nothing nothing Take my life if you will butoh
gentlemen a surgeon if you love me Im going offI m fainting

Drink then quick drink and swear Pat his back Cary Courage man
it will be over in a minute Now Frank

And Frank spoke


If plighted troth I fail or secret speech reveal May Cocytean ghosts
around my pillow squeal While Ates brazen claws distringe my spleen
in sunder And drag me deep to Plutos keep mid brimstone smoke and
thunder


Placetne domine

Placet squeaked Jack who thought himself at the last gasp and
gulped down full threequarters of the goblet which Cary held to his
lips

UghAhPuh Mercy on us It tastes mighty like wine

A proof my virtuous brother said Frank first of thy
abstemiousness which has thus forgotten what wine tastes like and
next of thy pure and heroical affection by which thy carnal senses
being exalted to a higher and supralunar sphere like those Platonical
daemonizomenoi and enthusiazomenoi of whom Jamblichus says that they
were insensible to wounds and flame and much more therefore to evil
savors doth make even the most nauseous draught redolent of that
celestial fragrance which proceeding O Jack from thine own inward
virtue assimilates by sympathy even outward accidents unto its own
harmony and melody for fragrance is as has been said well the song
of flowers and sweetness the music of applesAhem Go in peace thou
hast conquered

Put him out of the door Will said Amyas or he will swoon on our
hands

Give him some sack said Frank

Not a blessed drop of yours sir said Jack I like good wine as well
as any man on earth and see as little of it but not a drop of
yours sirs after your frumps and flouts about hangingon and
trencherscraping When I first began to love her I bid goodbye to all
dirty tricks for I had some one then for whom to keep myself clean

And so Jack was sent home with a pint of good red Alicant wine in him
more poor fellow than he had tasted at once in his life before
while the rest in high glee with themselves and the rest of the world
relighted the candles had a right merry evening and parted like good
friends and sensible gentlemen of devon thinking all except Frank
Jack Brimblecombe and his vow the merriest jest they had heard for
many a day After which they all departed Amyas and Cary to Winters
squadron Frank as soon as he could travel to the Court again
and with him young Basset whose father Sir Arthur being in London
procured for him a pages place in Leicesters household Fortescue and
Chicester went to their brothers in Dublin St Leger to his uncle
the Marshal of Munster Coffin joined Champernoun and Norris in the
Netherlands and so the Brotherhood of the Rose was scattered far and
wide and Mistress Salterne was left alone with her lookingglass



CHAPTER IX

HOW AMYAS KEPT HIS CHRISTMAS DAY

 Take aim you noble musqueteers
 And shoot you round about
 Stand to it valiant pikemen
 And we shall keep them out
 Theres not a man of all of us
 A foot will backward flee
 Ill be the foremost man in fight
 Says brave Lord Willoughby

 Elizabethan Ballad

It was the blessed Christmas afternoon The light was fading down the
evensong was done and the good folks of Bideford were trooping home
in merry groups the father with his children the lover with his
sweetheart to cakes and ale and flapdragons and mummers plays and
all the happy sports of Christmas night One lady only wrapped close in
her black muffler and followed by her maid walked swiftly yet sadly
toward the long causeway and bridge which led to Northam town
Sir Richard Grenville and his wife caught her up and stopped her
courteously

You will come home with us Mrs Leigh said Lady Grenville and
spend a pleasant Christmas night

Mrs Leigh smiled sweetly and laying one hand on Lady Grenvilles arm
pointed with the other to the westward and said

I cannot well spend a merry Christmas night while that sound is in my
ears

The whole party around looked in the direction in which she pointed
Above their heads the soft blue sky was fading into gray and here and
there a misty star peeped out but to the westward where the downs and
woods of Raleigh closed in with those of Abbotsham the blue was webbed
and turfed with delicate white flakes iridescent spots marking the
path by which the sun had sunk showed all the colors of the dying
dolphin and low on the horizon lay a long band of grassy green But
what was the sound which troubled Mrs Leigh None of them with their
merry hearts and ears dulled with the din and bustle of the town had
heard it till that moment and yet nowlisten It was dead calm There
was not a breath to stir a blade of grass And yet the air was full of
sound a low deep roar which hovered over down and wood saltmarsh and
river like the roll of a thousand wheels the tramp of endless armies
orwhat it wasthe thunder of a mighty surge upon the boulders of the
pebble ridge

The ridge is noisy tonight said Sir Richard There has been wind
somewhere

There is wind now where my boy is God help him said Mrs Leigh and
all knew that she spoke truly The spirit of the Atlantic storm had sent
forward the token of his coming in the smooth groundswell which was
heard inland two miles away Tomorrow the pebbles which were now
rattling down with each retreating wave might be leaping to the ridge
top and hurled like roundshot far ashore upon the marsh by the
force of the advancing wave fleeing before the wrath of the western
hurricane

God help my boy said Mrs Leigh again

God is as near him by sea as by land said good Sir Richard

True but I am a lone mother and one that has no heart just now but to
go home and pray

And so Mrs Leigh went onward up the lane and spent all that night in
listening between her prayers to the thunder of the surge till it was
drowned long ere the sun rose in the thunder of the storm

And where is Amyas on this same Christmas afternoon

Amyas is sitting bareheaded in a boats stern in Smerwick bay with the
spray whistling through his curls as he shouts cheerfully

Pull and with a will my merry men all and never mind shipping a sea
Cannon balls are a cargo that dont spoil by taking saltwater

His mothers presage has been true enough Christmas eve has been the
last of the still dark steaming nights of the early winter and the
western gale has been roaring for the last twelve hours upon the Irish
coast

The short light of the winter day is fading fast Behind him is a
leaping line of billows lashed into mist by the tempest Beside him
green foamfringed columns are rushing up the black rocks and falling
again in a thousand cataracts of snow Before him is the deep and
sheltered bay but it is not far up the bay that he and his can see for
some four miles out at sea begins a sloping roof of thick gray cloud
which stretches over their heads and up and far away inland cutting
the cliffs off at midheight hiding all the Kerry mountains and
darkening the hollows of the distant firths into the blackness of night
And underneath that awful roof of whirling mist the storm is howling
inland ever sweeping before it the great foamsponges and the gray
salt spray till all the land is hazy dim and dun Let it howl on for
there is more mist than ever salt spray made flying before that gale
more thunder than ever seasurge wakened echoing among the cliffs of
Smerwick bay along those sandhills flash in the evening gloom red
sparks which never came from heaven for that fort now christened by
the invaders the Fort Del Oro where flaunts the hated golden flag of
Spain holds San Josepho and eight hundred of the foe and but three
nights ago Amyas and Yeo and the rest of Winters shrewdest hands
slung four culverins out of the Admirals main deck and floated them
ashore and dragged them up to the battery among the sandhills and now
it shall be seen whether Spanish and Italian condottieri can hold their
own on British ground against the men of Devon

Small blame to Amyas if he was thinking not of his lonely mother at
Burrough Court but of those quick bright flashes on sandhill and
on fort where Salvation Yeo was hurling the eighteenpound shot with
deadly aim and watching with a cool and bitter smile of triumph the
flying of the sand and the crashing of the gabions Amyas and his party
had been on board at the risk of their lives for a fresh supply of
shot for Winters battery was out of ball and had been firing stones
for the last four hours in default of better missiles They ran the
boat on shore through the surf where a cove in the shore made landing
possible and almost careless whether she stove or not scrambled
over the sandhills with each man his brace of shot slung across his
shoulder and Amyas leaping into the trenches shouted cheerfully to
Salvation Yeo

More food for the bulldogs Gunner and plums for the Spaniards
Christmas pudding

Dont speak to a man at his business Master Amyas Five mortal times
have I missed but I will have that accursed Popish rag down as Im a
sinner

Down with it then nobody wants you to shoot crooked Take good iron
to it and not footy pavingstones

I believe sir that the foul fiend is there a turning of my shot
aside I do I thought I saw him once but thank Heaven heres ball
again Ah sir if one could but cast a silver one Now stand by men

And once again Yeos eighteenpounder roared and away And oh glory
the great yellow flag of Spain which streamed in the gale lifted
clean into the air flagstaff and all and then pitched wildly down
headforemost far to leeward

A hurrah from the sailors answered by the soldiers of the opposite
camp shook the very cloud above them but ere its echoes had died away
a tall officer leapt upon the parapet of the fort with the fallen flag
in his hand and rearing it as well as he could upon his lance point
held it firmly against the gale while the fallen flagstaff was raised
again within

In a moment a dozen long bows were bent at the daring foeman but Amyas
behind shouted

Shame lads Stop and let the gallant gentleman have due courtesy

So they stopped while Amyas springing on the rampart of the battery
took off his hat and bowed to the flagholder who as soon as relieved
of his charge returned the bow courteously and descended

It was by this time all but dark and the firing began to slacken on
all sides Salvation and his brother gunners having covered up their
slaughtering tackle with tarpaulings retired for the night leaving
Amyas who had volunteered to take the watch till midnight and the rest
of the force having got their scanty supper of biscuit for provisions
were running very short lay down under arms among the sandhills and
grumbled themselves to sleep

He had paced up and down in the gusty darkness for some hour or more
exchanging a passing word now and then with the sentinel when two
men entered the battery chatting busily together One was in complete
armor the other wrapped in the plain short cloak of a man of pens
and peace but the talk of both was neither of sieges nor of sallies
catapult bombard nor culverin but simply of English hexameters

And fancy not gentle reader that the two were therein fiddling while
Rome was burning for the commonweal of poetry and letters in that same
critical year 1580 was in far greater danger from those same hexameters
than the common woe of Ireland as Raleigh called it was from the
Spaniards

Imitating the classic metres versifying as it was called in
contradistinction to rhyming was becoming fast the fashion among the
more learned Stonyhurst and others had tried their hands at hexameter
translations from the Latin and Greek epics which seem to have been
doggerel enough and ever and anon some youthful wit broke out in
iambics sapphics elegiacs and what not to the great detriment of the
queens English and her subjects ears

I know not whether Mr William Webbe had yet given to the world any
fragments of his precious hints for the Reformation of English poetry
to the tune of his own Tityrus happily thou liest tumbling under a
beechtree but the Cambridge Malvolio Gabriel Harvey had succeeded
in arguing Spenser Dyer Sidney and probably Sidneys sister and the
whole clique of beauxesprits round them into following his model of

 What might I call this tree A laurel O bonny laurel
 Needes to thy bowes will I bowe this knee and vail my bonetto

after snubbing the first book of that Elvish Queene which was then
in manuscript as a base declension from the classical to the romantic
school

And now Spenser perhaps in mere melancholy wilfulness and want of
purpose for he had just been jilted by a fair maid of Kent was wasting
his mighty genius upon doggerel which he fancied antique and some
piratical publisher bitter Tom Nash swears and with likelihood that
Harvey did it himself had just given to the worldThree proper
wittie and familiar Letters lately past between two University
men touching the Earthquake in April last and our English reformed
Versifying which had set all town wits abuzzing like a swarm of
flies being none other than a correspondence between Spenser and
Harvey which was to prove to the world forever the correctness and
melody of such lines as

 For like magnificoes not a beck but glorious in show
 In deede most frivolous not a looke but Tuscanish always

Let them passAlma Mater has seen as bad hexameters since But then the
matter was serious There is a story I know not how true that Spenser
was half bullied into rewriting the Faerie Queene in hexameters had
not Raleigh a true romanticist whose vein for ditty or amorous ode
was most lofty insolent and passionate persuaded him to follow
his better genius The great dramatists had not yet arisen to form
completely that truly English school of which Spenser unconscious of
his own vast powers was laying the foundation And indeed it was not
till Daniel twenty years after in his admirable apology for rhyme had
smashed Mr Campian and his eight several kinds of classical numbers
that the matter was finally settled and the English tongue left to go
the road on which Heaven had started it So that we may excuse Raleighs
answering somewhat waspish to some quotation of Spensers from the three
letters of Immerito and G H

Tut tut Colin Clout much learning has made thee mad A good old
fishwives ballad jingle is worth all your sapphics and trimeters and
riffraff thurlery bouncing Hey have I you there old lad Do you
mind that precious verse

But dear Wat Homer and Virgil

But dear Ned Petrarch and Ovid

But Wat what have we that we do not owe to the ancients

Ancients quotha Why the legend of King Arthur and Chevy Chase too
of which even your fellowsinner Sidney cannot deny that every time
he hears it even from a blind fiddler it stirs his heart like a
trumpetblast Speak well of the bridge that carries you over man Did
you find your Redcross Knight in Virgil or such a dame as Una in old
Ovid No more than you did your Pater and Credo you renegado baptized
heathen you

Yet surely our younger and more barbarous taste must bow before
divine antiquity and imitate afar

As dottrels do fowlers If Homer was blind lad why dost not poke
out thine eye Ay this hexameter is of an ancient house truly Ned
Spenser and so is many a rogue but he cannot make way on our rough
English roads He goes hopping and twitching in our language like a
threelegged terrier over a pebblebank tumble and up again rattle and
crash

Nay hear now

 See ye the blindfolded pretty god that feathered archer
 Of lovers miseries which maketh his bloody game

True the accent gapes in places as I have often confessed to Harvey
but

  Strange as it may seem this distich is Spensers own and
 the other hexameters are all authentic

Harvey be hanged for a pedant and the whole crew of versifiers from
Lord Dorset but he poor man has been past hanging some time since
to yourself Why delude you into playing Procrustes as he does with the
queens English racking one word till its joints be pulled asunder and
squeezing the next all aheap as the Inquisitors do heretics in their
banca cava Out upon him and you and Sidney and the whole kin You
have not made a verse among you and never will which is not as lame a
gosling as Harveys own

 Oh thou weathercocke that stands on the top of Allhallows
 Come thy ways down if thou darst for thy crown and take the wall
 on us

Hark now There is our young giant comforting his soul with a ballad
You will hear rhyme and reason together here now He will not miscall
blindfolded blindfolded I warrant or make an of and a which
and a his carry a whole verse on their wretched little backs

And as he spoke Amyas who had been grumbling to himself some Christmas
carol broke out fullmouthed

 As Joseph was awalking
 He heard an angel sing
 This night shall be the birth night
 Of Christ our heavenly King

 His birthbed shall be neither
 In housen nor in hall
 Nor in the place of paradise
 But in the oxens stall

 He neither shall be rocked
 In silver nor in gold
 But in the wooden manger
 That lieth on the mould

 He neither shall be washen
 With white wine nor with red
 But with the fair spring water
 That on you shall be shed

 He neither shall be clothed
 In purple nor in pall
 But in the fair white linen
 That usen babies all

 As Joseph was awalking
 Thus did the angel sing
 And Marys Son at midnight
 Was born to be our King

 Then be you glad good people
 At this time of the year
 And light you up your candles
 For His star it shineth clear

There Edmunde Classicaster said Raleigh does not that simple
strain go nearer to the heart of him who wrote The Shepherds
Calendar than all artificial and outlandish

 Wote ye why his mother with a veil hath covered his face

Why dost not answer man

But Spenser was silent awhile and then

Because I was thinking rather of the rhymer than the rhyme Good
heaven how that brave lad shames me singing here the hymns which his
mother taught him before the very muzzles of Spanish guns instead of
bewailing unmanly as I have done the love which he held I doubt not
as dear as I did even my Rosalind This is his welcome to the winters
storm while I who dream forsooth of heavenly inspiration can but
see therein an image of mine own cowardly despair

 Thou barren ground whom winters wrath has wasted
 Art made a mirror to behold my plight

Pah away with frosts icicles and tears and sighs

  The Shepherds Calendar

And with hexameters and trimeters too I hope interrupted Raleigh
and all the trickeries of selfpleasing sorrow

I will set my heart to higher work than barking at the hand which
chastens me

Wilt put the lad into the Faerie Queene then by my side He
deserves as good a place there believe me as ever a Guyon or even as
Lord Grey your Arthegall Let us hail him Hallo young chanticleer of
Devon Art not afraid of a chance shot that thou crowest so lustily
upon thine own mixen

Cocks crow all night long at Christmas Captain Raleigh and so do I
said Amyass cheerful voice but whos there with you

A penitent pupil of yoursMr Secretary Spenser

Pupil of mine said Amyas I wish hed teach me a little of his art
I could fill up my time here with making verses

And who would be your theme fair sir said Spenser

No who at all I dont want to make sonnets to blue eyes nor black
either but if I could put down some of the things I saw in the Spice
Islands

Ah said Raleigh he would beat you out of Parnassus Mr Secretary
Remember you may write about Fairyland but he has seen it

And so have others said Spenser it is not so far off from any one
of us Wherever is love and loyalty great purposes and lofty souls
even though in a hovel or a mine there is Fairyland

Then Fairyland should be here friend for you represent love and
Leigh loyalty while as for great purposes and lofty souls who so fit
to stand for them as I being unless my enemies and my conscience are
liars both as ambitious and as proud as Lucifers own self

Ah Walter Walter why wilt always slander thyself thus

Slander TutI do but give the world a fair challenge and tell it
Thereyou know the worst of me come on and try a fall for either
you or I must down Slander Ask Leigh here who has but known me a
fortnight whether I am not as vain as a peacock as selfish as a fox
as imperious as a bona roba and ready to make a cats paw of him or any
man if there be a chestnut in the fire and yet the poor fool cannot
help loving me and running of my errands and taking all my schemes and
my dreams for gospel and verily believes now I think that I shall be
the man in the moon some day and he my big dog

Well said Amyas half apologetically if you are the cleverest man
in the world what harm in my thinking so

Hearken to him Edmund He will know better when he has outgrown this
same callow trick of honesty and learnt of the great goddess Detraction
how to show himself wiser than the wise by pointing out to the world
the fools motley which peeps through the rents in the philosophers
cloak Go to lad slander thy equals envy thy betters pray for an eye
which sees spots in every sun and for a vultures nose to scent
carrion in every rosebed If thy friend win a battle show that he has
needlessly thrown away his men if he lose one hint that he sold it
if he rise to a place argue favor if he fall from one argue divine
justice Believe nothing hope nothing but endure all things even to
kicking if aught may be got thereby so shalt thou be clothed in purple
and fine linen and sit in kings palaces and fare sumptuously every
day

And wake with Dives in the torment said Amyas Thank you for
nothing captain

Go to Misanthropos said Spenser Thou hast not yet tasted the
sweets of this worlds comfits and thou railest at them

The grapes are sour lad

And will be to the end said Amyas if they come off such a devils
tree as that I really think you are out of your mind Captain Raleigh
at times

I wish I were for it is a troublesome hungry windy mind as man ever
was cursed withal But come in lad We were sent from the lord deputy
to bid thee to supper There is a dainty lump of dead horse waiting for
thee

Send me some out then said matteroffact Amyas And tell his
lordship that with his good leave I dont stir from here till morning
if I can keep awake There is a stir in the fort and I expect them out
on us

Tut man their hearts are broken We know it by their deserters

Seeings believing I never trust runaway rogues If they are false to
their masters theyll be false to us

Well go thy ways old honesty and Mr Secretary shall give you a
book to yourself in the Faerie QueeneSir Monoculus or the Legend of
Common Sense eh Edmund

Monoculus

Ay Singleeye my prince of wordcoinerswont that fitAnd give
him the Cyclops head for a device Heighho They may laugh that win
I am sick of this Irish work were it not for the chance of advancement
Id sooner be driving a team of red Devons on Dartside and now I am
angry with the dear lad because he is not sick of it too What a plague
business has he to be paddling up and down contentedly doing his duty
like any city watchman It is an insult to the mighty aspirations of our
nobler heartseh my wouldbe Ariosto

Ah Raleigh you can afford to confess yourself less than some for you
are greater than all Go on and conquer noble heart But as for me I
sow the wind and I suppose I shall reap the whirlwind

Your harvest seems come already what a blast that was Hold on by me
Colin Clout and Ill hold on by thee So Dont tread on that pikemans
stomach lest he take thee for a marauding Don and with sudden dagger
slit Cohns pipe and Colins weasand too

And the two stumbled away into the darkness leaving Amyas to stride up
and down as before puzzling his brains over Raleighs wild words and
Spensers melancholy till he came to the conclusion that there was some
mysterious connection between cleverness and unhappiness and thanking
his stars that he was neither scholar courtier nor poet said grace
over his lump of horseflesh when it arrived devoured it as if it had
been venison and then returned to his pacing up and down but this time
in silence for the night was drawing on and there was no need to tell
the Spaniards that any one was awake and watching

So he began to think about his mother and how she might be spending
her Christmas and then about Frank and wondered at what grand Court
festival he was assisting amid bright lights and sweet music and gay
ladies and how he was dressed and whether he thought of his brother
there far away on the dark Atlantic shore and then he said his prayers
and his creed and then he tried not to think of Rose Salterne and of
course thought about her all the more So on passed the dull hours till
it might be past eleven oclock and all lights were out in the battery
and the shipping and there was no sound of living thing but the
monotonous tramp of the two sentinels beside him and now and then a
grunt from the party who slept under arms some twenty yards to the rear

So he paced to and fro looking carefully out now and then over the
strip of sandhill which lay between him and the fort but all was blank
and black and moreover it began to rain furiously

Suddenly he seemed to hear a rustle among the harsh sandgrass True
the wind was whistling through it loudly enough but that sound was
not altogether like the wind Then a soft sliding noise something had
slipped down a bank and brought the sand down after it Amyas stopped
crouched down beside a gun and laid his ear to the rampart whereby
he heard clearly as he thought the noise of approaching feet whether
rabbits or Christians he knew not but he shrewdly guessed the latter

Now Amyas was of a sober and businesslike turn at least when he was
not in a passion and thinking within himself that if he made any noise
the enemy whether four or twolegged would retire and all the sport
be lost he did not call to the two sentries who were at the opposite
ends of the battery neither did he think it worth while to rouse the
sleeping company lest his ears should have deceived him and the whole
camp turn out to repulse the attack of a buck rabbit

So he crouched lower and lower beside the culverin and was rewarded in
a minute or two by hearing something gently deposited against the mouth
of the embrasure which by the noise should be a piece of timber

So far so good said he to himself when the scaling ladder is up
the soldier follows I suppose I can only humbly thank them for giving
my embrasure the preference There he comes I hear his feet scuffling

He could hear plainly enough some one working himself into the mouth of
the embrasure but the plague was that it was so dark that he could
not see his hand between him and the sky much less his foe at two yards
off However he made a pretty fair guess as to the whereabouts and
rising softly discharged such a blow downwards as would have split a
yule log A volley of sparks flew up from the hapless Spaniards armor
and a grunt issued from within it which proved that whether he was
killed or not the blow had not improved his respiration

Amyas felt for his head seized it dragged him in over the gun sprang
into the embrasure on his knees felt for the top of the ladder found
it hove it clean off and out with four or five men on it and then of
course tumbled after it ten feet into the sand roaring like a town bull
to her majestys liege subjects in general

Sailorfashion he had no armor on but a light morion and a cuirass
so he was not too much encumbered to prevent his springing to his legs
instantly and setting to work cutting and foining right and left at
every sound for sight there was none

Battles as soldiers know and newspaper editors do not are usually
fought not as they ought to be fought but as they can be fought and
while the literary man is laying down the law at his desk as to how many
troops should be moved here and what rivers should be crossed there
and where the cavalry should have been brought up and when the flank
should have been turned the wretched man who has to do the work finds
the matter settled for him by pestilence want of shoes empty stomachs
bad roads heavy rains hot suns and a thousand other stern warriors
who never show on paper

So with this skirmish according to Cocker it ought to have been
a very pretty one for Hercules of Pisa who planned the sortie had
arranged it all being a very sansappel in all military science upon
the best Italian precedents and had brought against this very hapless
battery a column of a hundred to attack directly in front a company of
fifty to turn the right flank and a company of fifty to turn the left
flank with regulations orders passwords countersigns and what not
so that if every man had had his rights as seldom happens Don Guzman
Maria Magdalena de Soto who commanded the sortie ought to have taken
the work out of hand and annihilated all therein But alas here stern
fate interfered They had chosen a dark night as was politic they had
waited till the moon was up lest it should be too dark as was politic
likewise but just as they had started on came a heavy squall of rain
through which seven moons would have given no light and which washed
out the plans of Hercules of Pisa as if they had been written on a
schoolboys slate The company who were to turn the left flank walked
manfully down into the sea and never found out where they were going
till they were kneedeep in water The company who were to turn the
right flank bewildered by the utter darkness turned their own flank
so often that tired of falling into rabbitburrows and filling their
mouths with sand they halted and prayed to all the saints for a compass
and lantern while the centre body who held straight on by a trackway
to within fifty yards of the battery so miscalculated that short
distance that while they thought the ditch two pikes length off they
fell into it one over the other and of six scaling ladders the only
one which could be found was the very one which Amyas threw down again
After which the clouds broke the wind shifted and the moon shone out
merrily And so was the deep policy of Hercules of Pisa on which hung
the fate of Ireland and the Papacy decided by a ten minutes squall

But where is Amyas

In the ditch aware that the enemy is tumbling into it but unable to
find them while the company above finding it much too dark to attempt
a counter sortie have opened a smart fire of musketry and arrows on
things in general whereat the Spaniards are swearing like Spaniards I
need say no more and the Italians spitting like venomous cats while
Amyas not wishing to be riddled by friendly balls has got his back
against the foot of the rampart and waits on Providence

Suddenly the moon clears and with one more fierce volley the English
sailors seeing the confusion leap down from the embrasures and to it
pellmell Whether this also was according to Cocker I know not but
the sailor then as now is not susceptible of highlyfinished drill

Amyas is now in his element and so are the brave fellows at his heels
and there are ten breathless furious minutes among the sandhills and
then the trumpets blow a recall and the sailors drop back again by twos
and threes and are helped up into the embrasures over many a dead and
dying foe while the guns of Fort del Oro open on them and blaze away
for half an hour without reply and then all is still once more And in
the meanwhile the sortie against the deputys camp has fared no better
and the victory of the night remains with the English

Twenty minutes after Winter and the captains who were on shore were
drying themselves round a peatfire on the beach and talking over the
skirmish when Will Cary asked

Where is Leigh who has seen him I am sadly afraid he has gone too
far and been slain

Slain Never less gentlemen replied the voice of the very person in
question as he stalked out of the darkness into the glare of the fire
and shot down from his shoulders into the midst of the ring as he might
a sack of corn a huge dark body which was gradually seen to be a man
in rich armor who being so shot down lay quietly where he was dropped
with his feet luckily for him mailed in the fire

I say quoth Amyas some of you had better take him up if he is to
be of any use Unlace his helm Will Cary

Pull his feet out of the embers I dare say he would have been glad
enough to put us to the scarpines but thats no reason we should put
him to them

As has been hinted there was no love lost between Admiral Winter
and Amyas and Amyas might certainly have reported himself in a more
ceremonious manner So Winter whom Amyas either had not seen or had
not chosen to see asked him pretty sharply What the plague he had to
do with bringing dead men into camp

If hes dead its not my fault He was alive enough when I started
with him and I kept him right end uppermost all the way and what would
you have more sir

Mr Leigh said Winter it behoves you to speak with somewhat
more courtesy if not respect to captains who are your elders and
commanders

Ask your pardon sir said the giant as he stood in front of the fire
with the rain steaming and smoking off his armor but I was bred in
a school where getting good service done was more esteemed than making
fine speeches

Whatsoever school you were trained in sir said Winter nettled at
the hint about Drake it does not seem to have been one in which you
learned to obey orders Why did you not come in when the recall was
sounded

Because said Amyas very coolly in the first place I did not hear
it and in the next in my school I was taught when I had once started
not to come home emptyhanded

This was too pointed and Winter sprang up with an oathDo you mean to
insult me sir

I am sorry sir that you should take a compliment to Sir Francis Drake
as an insult to yourself I brought in this gentleman because I thought
he might give you good information if he dies meanwhile the loss will
be yours or rather the queens

Help me then said Cary glad to create a diversion in Amyass favor
and we will bring him round while Raleigh rose and catching Winters
arm drew him aside and began talking earnestly

What a murrain have you Leigh to quarrel with Winter asked two or
three

I say my reverend fathers and dear children do get the Dons talking
tackle free again and leave me and the admiral to settle it our own
way

There was more than one captain sitting in the ring but discipline and
the degrees of rank were not so severely defined as now and Amyas as
a gentleman adventurer was on land in a position very difficult
to be settled though at sea he was as liable to be hanged as any other
person on board and on the whole it was found expedient to patch the
matter up So Captain Raleigh returning said that though Admiral Winter
had doubtless taken umbrage at certain words of Mr Leighs yet that
he had no doubt that Mr Leigh meant nothing thereby but what was
consistent with the profession of a soldier and a gentleman and worthy
both of himself and of the admiral

From which proposition Amyas found it impossible to dissent whereon
Raleigh went back and informed Winter that Leigh had freely retracted
his words and fully wiped off any imputation which Mr Winter might
conceive to have been put upon him and so forth So Winter returned
and Amyas said frankly enough

Admiral Winter I hope as a loyal soldier that you will understand
thus far that naught which has passed tonight shall in any way prevent
you finding me a forward and obedient servant to all your commands be
they what they may and a supporter of your authority among the men
and honor against the foe even with my life For I should be ashamed if
private differences should ever prejudice by a grain the public weal

This was a great effort of oratory for Amyas and he therefore in order
to be safe by following precedent tried to talk as much as he could
like Sir Richard Grenville Of course Winter could answer nothing to it
in spite of the plain hint of private differences but that he should
not fail to show himself a captain worthy of so valiant and trusty
a gentleman whereon the whole party turned their attention to the
captive who thanks to Will Cary was by this time sitting up standing
much in need of a handkerchief and looking about him having been
unhelmed in a confused and doleful manner

Take the gentleman to my tent said Winter and let the surgeon see
to him Mr Leigh who is he

An enemy but whether Spaniard or Italian I know not but he seemed
somebody among them I thought the captain of a company He and I cut at
each other twice or thrice at first and then lost each other and after
that I came on him among the sandhills trying to rally his men and
swearing like the mouth of the pit whereby I guess him a Spaniard But
his men ran so I brought him in

And how asked Raleigh Thou art giving us all the play but the
murders and the marriages

Why I bid him yield and he would not Then I bid him run and he
would not And it was too pitchdark for fighting so I took him by the
ears and shook the wind out of him and so brought him in

Shook the wind out of him cried Cary amid the roar of laughter which
followed Dost know thou hast nearly wrung his neck in two His vizor
was full of blood

He should have run or yielded then said Amyas and getting up
slipped off to find some ale and then to sleep comfortably in a dry
burrow which he scratched out of a sandbank

The next morning as Amyas was discussing a scanty breakfast of biscuit
for provisions were running very short in camp Raleigh came up to
him

What eating Thats more than I have done today

Sit down and share then

Nay lad I did not come abegging I have set some of my rogues to dig
rabbits but as I live young Colbrand you may thank your stars that
you are alive today to eat Poor young CheekSir John Cheek the
grammarians songot his quittance last night by a Spanish pike
rushing headlong on just as you did But have you seen your prisoner

No nor shall while he is in Winters tent

Why not then What quarrel have you against the admiral friend
Bobadil Cannot you let Francis Drake fight his own battles without
thrusting your head in between them

Well that is good As if the quarrel was not just as much mine and
every mans in the ship Why when he left Drake he left us all did he
not

And what if he did Let bygones be bygones is the rule of a Christian
and of a wise man too Amyas Here the man is at least safe home
in favor and in power and a prudent youth will just hold his tongue
mumchance and swim with the stream

But thats just what makes me mad to see this fellow after deserting
us there in unknown seas win credit and rank at home here for being the
first man who ever sailed back through the Straits What had he to do
with sailing back at all As well make the fox a knight for being the
first that ever jumped down a jakes to escape the hounds The fiercer
the flight the fouler the fear say I

Amyas Amyas thou art a hard hitter but a soft politician

I am no politician Captain Raleigh nor ever wish to be An honest
mans my friend and a rogues my foe and Ill tell both as much as
long as I breathe

And die a poor saint said Raleigh laughing But if Winter invites
you to his tent himself you wont refuse to come

Why no considering his years and rank but he knows too well to do
that

He knows too well not to do it said Raleigh laughing as he walked
away And verily in halfanhour came an invitation extracted of
course from the admiral by Raleighs silver tongue which Amyas could
not but obey

We all owe you thanks for last nights service sir said Winter who
had for some good reasons changed his tone Your prisoner is found to
be a gentleman of birth and experience and the leader of the assault
last night He has already told us more than we had hoped for which
also we are beholden to you and indeed my Lord Grey has been asking
for you already

I have young sir said a quiet and lofty voice and Amyas saw limping
from the inner tent the proud and stately figure of the stern deputy
Lord Grey of Wilton a brave and wise man but with a naturally harsh
temper which had been soured still more by the wound which had crippled
him while yet a boy at the battle of Leith He owed that limp to Mary
Queen of Scots and he did not forget the debt

I have been asking for you having heard from many both of your last
nights prowess and of your conduct and courage beyond the promise of
your years displayed in that evermemorable voyage which may well be
ranked with the deeds of the ancient Argonauts

Amyas bowed low and the lord deputy went on You will needs wish
to see your prisoner You will find him such a one as you need not be
ashamed to have taken and as need not be ashamed to have been taken by
you but here he is and will I doubt not answer as much for himself
Know each other better gentlemen both last night was an ill one for
making acquaintances Don Guzman Maria Magdalena Sotomayor de Soto know
the hidalgo Amyas Leigh

As he spoke the Spaniard came forward still in his armor all save his
head which was bound up in a handkerchief

He was an exceedingly tall and graceful personage of that sangre azul
which marked high Visigothic descent goldenhaired and fairskinned
with hands as small and white as a womans his lips were delicate but
thin and compressed closely at the corners of the mouth and his pale
blue eye had a glassy dulness In spite of his beauty and his carriage
Amyas shrank from him instinctively and yet he could not help
holding out his hand in return as the Spaniard holding out his said
languidly in most sweet and sonorous Spanish

I kiss his hands and feet The senor speaks I am told my native
tongue

I have that honor

Then accept in it for I can better express myself therein than in
English though I am not altogether ignorant of that witty and learned
language the expression of my pleasure at having fallen into the
hands of one so renowned in war and travel and of one also he added
glancing at Amyass giant bulk the vastness of whose strength beyond
that of common mortality makes it no more shame for me to have been
overpowered and carried away by him than if my captor had been a paladin
of Charlemagnes

Honest Amyas bowed and stammered a little thrown off his balance by the
unexpected assurance and cool flattery of his prisoner but he said

If you are satisfied illustrious senor I am bound to be so I
only trust that in my hurry and the darkness I have not hurt you
unnecessarily

The Don laughed a pretty little hollow laugh No kind senor my head
I trust will after a few days have become united to my shoulders
and for the present your company will make me forget any slight
discomfort

Pardon me senor but by this daylight I should have seen that armor
before

I doubt it not senor as having been yourself also in the forefront of
the battle said the Spaniard with a proud smile

If I am right senor you are he who yesterday held up the standard
after it was shot down

I do not deny that undeserved honor and I have to thank the courtesy
of you and your countrymen for having permitted me to do so with
impunity

Ah I heard of that brave feat said the lord deputy You should
consider yourself Mr Leigh honored by being enabled to show courtesy
to such a warrior

How long this interchange of solemn compliments of which Amyas was
getting somewhat weary would have gone on I know not but at that
moment Raleigh entered hastily

My lord they have hung out a white flag and are calling for a
parley

The Spaniard turned pale and felt for his sword which was gone and
then with a bitter laugh murmured to himselfAs I expected

I am very sorry to hear it Would to Heaven they had simply fought it
out said Lord Grey half to himself and then Go Captain Raleigh
and answer them that saving this gentlemans presence the laws of
war forbid a parley with any who are leagued with rebels against their
lawful sovereign

But what if they wish to treat for this gentlemans ransom

For their own more likely said the Spaniard but tell them on my
part senor that Don Guzman refuses to be ransomed and will return to
no camp where the commanding officer unable to infect his captains with
his own cowardice dishonors them against their will

You speak sharply senor said Winter after Raleigh had gone out

I have reason Senor Admiral as you will find I fear erelong

We shall have the honor of leaving you here for the present sir as
Admiral Winters guest said the lord deputy

But not my sword it seems

Pardon me senor but no one has deprived you of your sword said
Winter

I dont wish to pain you sir said Amyas but I fear that we were
both careless enough to leave it behind last night

A flash passed over the Spaniards face which disclosed terrible depths
of fury and hatred beneath that quiet mask as the summer lightning
displays the black abysses of the thunderstorm but like the summer
lightning it passed almost unseen and blandly as ever he answered

I can forgive you for such a neglect most valiant sir more easily
than I can forgive myself Farewell sir One who has lost his sword is
no fit company for you And as Amyas and the rest departed he plunged
into the inner tent stamping and writhing gnawing his hands with rage
and shame

As Amyas came out on the battery Yeo hailed him

Master Amyas Hillo sir For the love of Heaven tell me

What then

Is his lordship stanch Will he do the Lords work faithfully root and
branch or will he spare the Amalekites

The latter I think old hipandthigh said Amyas hurrying forward
to hear the news from Raleigh who appeared in sight once more

They ask to depart with bag and baggage said he when he came up

God do so to me and more also if they carry away a straw said Lord
Grey Make short work of it sir

I do not know how that will be my lord as I came up a captain shouted
to me off the walls that there were mutineers and denying that he
surrendered would have pulled down the flag of truce but the soldiers
beat him off

A house divided against itself will not stand long gentlemen Tell
them that I give no conditions Let them lay down their arms and trust
in the Bishop of Rome who sent them hither and may come to save them
if he wants them Gunners if you see the white flag go down open your
fire instantly Captain Raleigh we need your counsel here Mr Cary
will you be my herald this time

A better Protestant never went on a pleasanter errand my lord

So Cary went and then ensued an argument as to what should be done
with the prisoners in case of a surrender

I cannot tell whether my Lord Grey meant by offering conditions which
the Spaniards would not accept to force them into fighting the quarrel
out and so save himself the responsibility of deciding on their
fate or whether his mere natural stubbornness as well as his just
indignation drove him on too far to retract but the council of war
which followed was both a sad and a stormy one and one which he had
reason to regret to his dying day What was to be done with the enemy
They already outnumbered the English and some fifteen hundred of
Desmonds wild Irish hovered in the forests round ready to side with
the winning party or even to attack the English at the least sign of
vacillation or fear They could not carry the Spaniards away with them
for they had neither shipping nor food not even handcuffs enough for
them and as Mackworth told Winter when he proposed it the only plan
was for him to make San Josepho a present of his ships and swim home
himself as he could To turn loose in Ireland as Captain Touch urged
on the other hand seven hundred such monsters of lawlessness cruelty
and lust as Spanish and Italian condottieri were in those days was
as fatal to their own safety as cruel to the wretched Irish All the
captains without exception followed on the same side What was to be
done then asked Lord Grey impatiently Would they have him murder
them all in cold blood

And for a while every man knowing that it must come to that and yet
not daring to say it till Sir Warham St Leger the marshal of Munster
spoke out stoutly Foreigners had been scoffing them too long and too
truly with waging these Irish wars as if they meant to keep them alive
rather than end them Mercy and faith to every Irishman who would show
mercy and faith was his motto but to invaders no mercy Ireland was
Englands vulnerable point it might be some day her ruin a terrible
example must be made of those who dare to touch the sore Rather pardon
the Spaniards for landing in the Thames than in Irelandtill Lord
Grey became much excited and turning as a last hope to Raleigh asked
his opinion but Raleighs silver tongue was that day not on the side
of indulgence He skilfully recapitulated the arguments of his
fellowcaptains improving them as he went on till each worthy soldier
was surprised to find himself so much wiser a man than he had thought
and finished by one of his rapid and passionate perorations upon his
favorite themethe West Indian cruelties of the Spaniards   
by which great tracts and fair countries are now utterly stripped of
inhabitants by heavy bondage and torments unspeakable Oh witless
Islanders said he apostrophizing the Irish would to Heaven that you
were here to listen to me What other fate awaits you if this viper
which you are so ready to take into your bosom should be warmed to
life but to groan like the Indians slaves to the Spaniard but to
perish like the Indians by heavy burdens cruel chains plunder and
ravishment scourged racked roasted stabbed sawn in sunder cast to
feed the dogs as simple and more righteous peoples have perished ere
now by millions And what else I say had been the fate of Ireland
had this invasion prospered which God has now by our weak hands
confounded and brought to naught Shall we then answer it my lord
either to our conscience our God or our queen if we shall set loose
men not one of whom I warrant but is stained with murder on murder
to go and fill up the cup of their iniquity among these silly sheep
Have not their native wolves their barbarous chieftains shorn peeled
and slaughtered them enough already but we must add this pack of
foreign wolves to the number of their tormentors and fit the Desmond
with a bodyguard of seven yea seven hundred devils worse than
himself Nay rather let us do violence to our own human nature and
show ourselves in appearance rigorous that we may be kind indeed lest
while we presume to be overmerciful to the guilty we prove ourselves
to be overcruel to the innocent

Captain Raleigh Captain Raleigh said Lord Grey the blood of these
men be on your head

It ill befits your lordship answered Raleigh to throw on your
subordinates the blame of that which your reason approves as necessary

I should have thought sir that one so noted for ambition as Captain
Raleigh would have been more careful of the favor of that queen for
whose smiles he is said to be so longing a competitor If you have not
yet been of her counsels sir I can tell you you are not likely to be
She will be furious when she hears of this cruelty

Lord Grey had lost his temper but Raleigh kept his and answered
quietly

Her majesty shall at least not find me among the number of those who
prefer her favor to her safety and abuse to their own profit that
overtenderness and mercifulness of heart which is the only blemish
and yet rather like a mole on a fair cheek but a new beauty in her
manifold perfections

At this juncture Cary returned

My lord said he in some confusion I have proposed your terms but
the captains still entreat for some mitigation and to tell you truth
one of them has insisted on accompanying me hither to plead his cause
himself

I will not see him sir Who is he

His name is Sebastian of Modena my lord

Sebastian of Modena What think you gentlemen May we make an
exception in favor of so famous a soldier

So villainous a cutthroat said Zouch to Raleigh under his breath

All however were for speaking with so famous a man and in came in
full armor a short bullnecked Italian evidently of immense strength
of the true Caesar Borgia stamp

Will you please to be seated sir said Lord Grey coldly

I kiss your hands most illustrious but I do not sit in an enemys
camp Ha my friend Zouch How has your signoria fared since we fought
side by side at Lepanto So you too are here sitting in council on the
hanging of me

What is your errand sir Time is short said the lord deputy

Corpo di Bacco It has been long enough all the morning for my
rascals have kept me and my friend the Colonel Hercules whom you know
doubtless prisoners in our tents at the pikes point My lord deputy
I have but a few words I shall thank you to take every soldier in the
fortItalian Spaniard and Irishand hang them up as high as Haman
for a set of mutinous cowards with the archtraitor San Josepho at
their head

I am obliged to you for your offer sir and shall deliberate presently
as to whether I shall not accept it

But as for us captains really your excellency must consider that we
are gentlemen born and give us either buena querra as the Spaniards
say or a fair chance for life and so to my business

Stay sir Answer this first Have you or yours any commission to show
either from the King of Spain or any other potentate

Never a one but the cause of Heaven and our own swords And with them
my lord we are ready to meet any gentlemen of your camp man to man
with our swords only halfway between your leaguer and ours and I
doubt not that your lordship will see fair play Will any gentleman
accept so civil an offer There sits a tall youth in that corner
who would suit me very well Will any fit my gallant comrades with
halfanhours punto and stoccado

There was a silence all looking at the lord deputy whose eyes were
kindling in a very ugly way

No answer Then I must proceed to exhortation So Will that be
sufficient

And walking composedly across the tent the fearless ruffian quietly
stooped down and smote Amyas Leigh full in the face

Up sprang Amyas heedless of all the august assembly and with a single
buffet felled him to the earth

Excellent said he rising unabashed I can always trust my instinct
I knew the moment I saw him that he was a cavalier worth letting blood
Now sir your sword and harness and I am at your service outside

The solemn and sententious Englishmen were altogether taken aback by the
Italians impudence but Zouch settled the matter

Most noble captain will you be pleased to recollect a certain little
occurrence at Messina in the year 1575 For if you do not I do and
beg to inform this gentleman that you are unworthy of his sword and
had you unluckily for you been an Englishman would have found the
fashions of our country so different from your own that you would have
been then hanged sir and probably may be so still

The Italians sword flashed out in a moment but Lord Grey interfered

No fighting here gentlemen That may wait and what is more shall
wait tillStrike their swords down Raleigh Mackworth Strike their
swords down Colonel Sebastian you will be pleased to return as you
came in safety having lost nothing as I frankly tell you you
have gained nothing by your wild bearing here We shall proceed to
deliberate on your fate

I trust my lord said Amyas that you will spare this braggarts
life at least for a day or two For in spite of Captain Zouchs
warning I must have to do with him yet or my cheek will rise up in
judgment against me at the last day

Well spoken lad said the colonel as he swung out So worth a
reprieve by this sword to have one more rapierrattle before the
gallows Then I take back no further answer my lord deputy Not even
our swords our virgin blades signor the soldiers cherished bride
Shall we go forth weeping widowers and leave to strange embrace the
lovely steel

None sir by heaven said he waxing wroth Do you come hither
pirates as you are to dictate terms upon a foreign soil Is it not
enough to have set up here the Spanish flag and claimed the land
of Ireland as the Popes gift to the Spaniard violated the laws of
nations and the solemn treaties of princes under color of a mad
superstition

Superstition my lord Nothing less Believe a philosopher who has not
said a pater or an ave for seven years past at least Quod tango
credo is my motto and though I am bound to say under pain of the
Inquisition that the most holy Father the Pope has given this land of
Ireland to his most Catholic Majesty the King of Spain Queen Elizabeth
having forfeited her title to it by heresywhy my lord I believe it
as little as you do I believe that Ireland would have been mine if I
had won it I believe religiously that it is not mine now I have lost
it What is is and a fig for priests today to thee tomorrow to me
Addio And out he swung

There goes a most gallant rascal said the lord deputy

And a most rascally gallant said Zouch The murder of his own page
of which I gave him a remembrancer is among the least of his sins

And now Captain Raleigh said Lord Grey as you have been so earnest
in preaching this butchery I have a right to ask none but you to
practise it

Raleigh bit his lip and replied by the quip courteous

I am at least a man my lord who thinks it shame to allow others to do
that which I dare not do myself

Lord Grey might probably have returned the countercheck quarrelsome
had not Mackworth risen

And I my lord being in that matter at least one of Captain Raleighs
kidney will just go with him to see that he takes no harm by being bold
enough to carry out an ugly business and serving these rascals as their
countrymen served Mr Oxenham

I bid you good morning then gentlemen though I cannot bid you God
speed said Lord Grey and sitting down again covered his face with
his hands and to the astonishment of all bystanders burst say the
chroniclers into tears

Amyas followed Raleigh out The latter was pale but determined and
very wroth against the deputy

Does the man take me for a hangman said he that he speaks to me
thus But such is the way of the great If you neglect your duty
they haul you over the coals if you do it you must do it on your
own responsibility Farewell Amyas you will not shrink from me as a
butcher when I return

God forbid But how will you do it

March one company in and drive them forth and let the other cut them
down as they come outPah

     

It was done Right or wrong it was done The shrieks and curses had
died away and the Fort del Oro was a red shambles which the soldiers
were trying to cover from the sight of heaven and earth by dragging the
bodies into the ditch and covering them with the ruins of the rampart
while the Irish who had beheld from the woods that awful warning fled
trembling into the deepest recesses of the forest It was done and
it never needed to be done again The hint was severe but it was
sufficient Many years passed before a Spaniard set foot again in
Ireland

The Spanish and Italian officers were spared and Amyas had Don Guzman
Maria Magdalena Sotomayor de Soto duly adjudged to him as his prize
by right of war He was of course ready enough to fight Sebastian
of Modena but Lord Grey forbade the duel blood enough had been shed
already The next question was where to bestow Don Guzman till his
ransom should arrive and as Amyas could not well deliver the gallant
Don into the safe custody of Mrs Leigh at Burrough and still less into
that of Frank at Court he was fain to write to Sir Richard Grenville
and ask his advice and in the meanwhile keep the Spaniard with him upon
parole which he frankly gavesaying that as for running away he had
nowhere to run to and as for joining the Irish he had no mind to turn
pig and Amyas found him as shall be hereafter told pleasant company
enough But one morning Raleigh entered

I have done you a good turn Leigh if you think it one I have talked
St Leger into making you my lieutenant and giving you the custody of
a right pleasant hermitagesome castle Shackatory or other in the midst
of a big bog where time will run swift and smooth with you between
hunting wild Irish snaring snipes and drinking yourself drunk with
usquebaugh over a turf fire

Ill go quoth Amyas anything for work So he went and took
possession of his lieutenancy and his black robber tower and there
passed the rest of the winter fighting or hunting all day and chatting
and reading all the evening with Senor Don Guzman who like a good
soldier of fortune made himself thoroughly at home and a general
favorite with the soldiers

At first indeed his Spanish pride and stateliness and Amyass English
taciturnity kept the two apart somewhat but they soon began if not
to trust at least to like each other and Don Guzman told Amyas bit by
bit who he was of what an ancient house and of what a poor one and
laughed over the very small chance of his ransom being raised and
the certainty that at least it could not come for a couple of years
seeing that the only De Soto who had a penny to spare was a fat old dean
at St Yago de Leon in the Caracas at which place Don Guzman had been
born This of course led to much talk about the West Indies and the
Don was as much interested to find that Amyas had been one of Drakes
worldfamous crew as Amyas was to find that his captive was the
grandson of none other than that most terrible of manhunters Don
Ferdinando de Soto the conqueror of Florida of whom Amyas had read
many a time in Las Casas as the captain of tyrants the notoriousest
and most experimented amongst them that have done the most hurts
mischiefs and destructions in many realms And often enough his blood
boiled and he had much ado to recollect that the speaker was his guest
as Don Guzman chatted away about his grandfathers hunts of innocent
women and children murders of caciques and burnings alive of guides
pour encourager les autres without seemingly the least feeling that
the victims were human beings or subjects for human pity anything in
short but heathen dogs enemies of God servants of the devil to be
used by the Christian when he needed and when not needed killed down
as cumberers of the ground But Don Guzman was a most finished gentleman
nevertheless and told many a good story of the Indies and told it
well and over and above his stories he had among his baggage two
booksthe one Antonio Galvanos Discoveries of the World a mine
of winter evening amusement to Amyas and the other a manuscript book
which perhaps it had been well for Amyas had he never seen For it was
none other than a sort of rough journal which Don Guzman had kept as a
lad when he went down with the Adelantado Gonzales Ximenes de Casada
from Peru to the River of Amazons to look for the golden country of El
Dorado and the city of Manoa which stands in the midst of the White
Lake and equals or surpasses in glory even the palace of the Inca
Huaynacapac all the vessels of whose house and kitchen are of gold
and silver and in his wardrobe statues of gold which seemed giants and
figures in proportion and bigness of all the beasts birds trees and
herbs of the earth and the fishes of the water and ropes budgets
chests and troughs of gold yea and a garden of pleasure in an Island
near Puna where they went to recreate themselves when they would take
the air of the sea which had all kind of garden herbs flowers and
trees of gold and silver of an invention and magnificence till then
never seen

Now the greater part of this treasure and be it remembered that these
wonders were hardly exaggerated and that there were many men alive then
who had beheld them as they had worse things with their corporal and
mortal eyes was hidden by the Indians when Pizarro conquered Peru and
slew Atahuallpa son of Huaynacapac at whose death it was said one
of the Incas younger brothers fled out of Peru and taking with him
a great army vanquished all that tract which lieth between the great
Rivers of Amazons and Baraquan otherwise called Maranon and Orenoque

There he sits to this day beside the golden lake in the golden city
which is in breadth a three days journey covered he and his court
with gold dust from head to foot waiting for the fulfilment of the
ancient prophecy which was written in the temple of Caxamarca where his
ancestors worshipped of old that heroes shall come out of the West and
lead him back across the forests to the kingdom of Peru and restore him
to the glory of his forefathers

Golden phantom so possible so probable to imaginations which were yet
reeling before the actual and veritable prodigies of Peru Mexico and
the East Indies Golden phantom which has cost already the lives
of thousands and shall yet cost more from Diego de Ordas and Juan
Corteso and many another who went forth on the quest by the Andes and
by the Orinoco and by the Amazons Antonio Sedenno with his ghastly
caravan of manacled Indians on whose dead carcasses the tigers being
fleshed assaulted the Spaniards Augustine Delgado who came to a
cacique who entertained him with all kindness and gave him beside much
gold and slaves three nymphs very beautiful which bare the names
of three provinces Guanba Gotoguane and Maiarare To requite which
manifold courtesies he carried off not only all the gold but all the
Indians he could seize and took them in irons to Cubagua and sold them
for slaves after which Delgado was shot in the eye by an Indian of
which hurt he died Pedro dOrsua who found the cinnamon forests of
Loxas whom his men murdered and afterwards beheaded Lady Anes his
wife who forsook not her lord in all his travels unto death and many
another who has vanished with valiant comrades at his back into the
green gulfs of the primaeval forests never to emerge again Golden
phantom mandevouring whose maw is never satiate with souls of heroes
fatal to Spain more fatal still to England upon that shameful day when
the last of Elizabeths heroes shall lay down his head upon the block
nominally for having believed what all around him believed likewise
till they found it expedient to deny it in order to curry favor with the
crowned cur who betrayed him really because he alone dared to make one
last protest in behalf of liberty and Protestantism against the incoming
night of tyranny and superstition Little thought Amyas as he devoured
the pages of that manuscript that he was laying a snare for the life of
the man whom next to Drake and Grenville he most admired on earth

But Don Guzman on the other hand seemed to have an instinct that that
book might be a fatal gift to his captor for one day ere Amyas had
looked into it he began questioning the Don about El Dorado Whereon
Don Guzman replied with one of those smiles of his which as Amyas said
afterwards was so abominably like a sneer that he had often hard work
to keep his hands off the man

Ah You have been eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge senor
Well if you have any ambition to follow many another brave captain
to the pit I know no shorter or easier path than is contained in that
little book

I have never opened your book said Amyas your private manuscripts
are no concern of mine but my man who recovered your baggage read
part of it knowing no better and now you are at liberty to tell me as
little as you like

The man it should be said was none other than Salvation Yeo who
had attached himself by this time inseparably to Amyas in quality of
bodyguard and as was common enough in those days had turned soldier
for the nonce and taken under his patronage two or three rusty bases
swivels and falconets fourpounders which grinned harmlessly enough
from the tower top across the cheerful expanse of bog

Amyas once asked him how he reconciled this Irish sojourn with his vow
to find his little maid Yeo shook his head

I cant tell sir but theres something that makes me always to think
of you when I think of her and thats often enough the Lord knows
Whether it is that I bent to find the dear without your help or
whether it is your pleasant face puts me in mind of hers or what I
cant tell but dont you part me from you sir for Im like Ruth
and where you lodge I lodge and where you go I go and where you
diethough I shall die many a year firstthere Ill die I hope and
trust for I cant abear you out of my sight and thats the truth
thereof

So Yeo remained with Amyas while Cary went elsewhere with Sir Warham
St Leger and the two friends met seldom for many months so that
Amyass only companion was Don Guzman who as he grew more familiar
and more careless about what he said and did in his captors presence
often puzzled and scandalized him by his waywardness Fits of deep
melancholy alternated with bursts of Spanish boastfulness utterly
astonishing to the modest and soberminded Englishman who would often
have fancied him inspired by usquebaugh had he not had ocular proof of
his extreme abstemiousness

Miserable said he one night in one of these fits And have I not
a right to be miserable Why should I not curse the virgin and all the
saints and die I have not a friend not a ducat on earth not even a
swordhell and the furies It was my all the only bequest I ever had
from my father and I lived by it and earned by it Two years ago I had
as pretty a sum of gold as cavalier could wishand now

What is become of it then I cannot hear that our men plundered you of
any

Your men No senor What fifty men dared not have done one woman did
a painted patched fucused periwigged bolstered Charybdis cannibal
Megaera Lamia Why did I ever go near that cursed Naples the common
sewer of Europe whose women I believe would be swallowed up by
Vesuvius tomorrow if it were not that Belphegor is afraid of their
making the pit itself too hot to hold him Well sir she had all of
mine and more and when all was gone in wine and dice woodcocks brains
and ortolans tongues I met the witch walking with another man I had
a sword and a dagger I gave him the first though the dog fought well
enough to give him his due and her the second left them lying across
each other and fled for my lifeand here I am after twenty years of
fighting from the Levant to the Orellanafor I began ere I had a
hair on my chinand this is the endNo it is not Ill have that El
Dorado yet the Adelantado made Berreo when he gave him his daughter
swear that he would hunt for it through life and deathWell see
who finds it first he or I Hes a bungler Orsua was a bunglerPooh
Cortes and Pizarro well see whether there are not as good Castilians
as they left still I can do it senor I know a track a plan over the
Llanos is the road and Ill be Emperor of Manoa yetpossess the jewels
of all the Incas and gold gold Pizarro was a beggar to what I will
be

Conceive sir he broke forth during another of these peacock fits
as Amyas and he were riding along the hillside conceive with forty
chosen cavaliers what need of more I present myself before the golden
king trembling amid his myriad guards at the new miracle of the mailed
centaurs of the West and without dismounting I approach his throne
lift the crucifix which hangs around my neck and pressing it to my
lips present it for the adoration of the idolater and give him his
alternative that which Gayferos and the Cid my ancestors offered
the Soldan and the Moorbaptism or death He hesitates perhaps
smiles scornfully upon my little band I answer him by deeds as Don
Ferdinando my illustrious grandfather answered Atahuallpa at Peru in
sight of all his court and camp

With your lancepoint as Gayferos did the Soldan asked Amyas
amused

No sir persuasion first for the salvation of a soul is at stake Not
with the lancepoint but the spur sir thus

And striking his heels into his horses flanks he darted off at full
speed

The Spanish traitor shouted Yeo Hes going to escape Shall we
shoot sir Shall we shoot

For Heavens sake no said Amyas looking somewhat blank
nevertheless for he much doubted whether the whole was not a ruse on
the part of the Spaniard and he knew how impossible it was for his
fifteen stone of flesh to give chase to the Spaniards twelve But he
was soon reassured the Spaniard wheeled round towards him and began to
put the rough hackney through all the paces of the manege with a grace
and skill which won applause from the beholders

Thus he shouted waving his hand to Amyas between his curvets and
caracoles did my illustrious grandfather exhibit to the Paynim emperor
the prowess of a Castilian cavalier Thusand thusand thus at
last he dashed up to his very feet as I to yours and bespattering
that unbaptized visage with his Christian bridle foam pulled up his
charger on his haunches thus

And as was to be expected from a blown Irish garron on a peaty Irish
hillside down went the hapless hackney on his tail away went his
heels a yard in front of him and ere Don Guzman could avoid his
selle horse and man rolled over into neighboring boghole

After pride comes a fall quoth Yeo with unmoved visage as he lugged
him out

And what would you do with the emperor at last asked Amyas when the
Don had been scrubbed somewhat clean with a bunch of rushes Kill him
as your grandfather did Atahuallpa

My grandfather answered the Spaniard indignantly was one of those
who to their eternal honor protested to the last against that most
cruel and unknightly massacre He could be terrible to the heathen but
he kept his plighted word sir and taught me to keep mine as you have
seen today

I have senor said Amyas You might have given us the slip easily
enough just now and did not Pardon me if I have offended you

The Spaniard who after all was cross principally with himself and the
unlucky mares son as the old romances have it which had played him
so scurvy a trick was all smiles again forthwith and Amyas as they
chatted on could not help asking him next

I wonder why you are so frank about your own intentions to an enemy
like me who will surely forestall you if he can

Sir a Spaniard needs no concealment and fears no rivalry He is the
soldier of the Cross and in it he conquers like Constantine of old
Not that you English are not very heroes but you have not sir and
you cannot have who have forsworn our Lady and the choir of saints the
same divine protection the same celestial mission which enables the
Catholic cavalier singlehanded to chase a thousand Paynims

And Don Guzman crossed himself devoutly and muttered halfadozen Ave
Marias in succession while Amyas rode silently by his side utterly
puzzled at this strange compound of shrewdness with fanaticism of
perfect highbreeding with a boastfulness which in an Englishman would
have been the sure mark of vulgarity

At last came a letter from Sir Richard Grenville complimenting Amyas
on his success and promotion bearing a long and courtly message to Don
Guzman whom Grenville had known when he was in the Mediterranean at
the battle of Lepanto and offering to receive him as his own guest
at Bideford till his ransom should arrive a proposition which the
Spaniard who of course was getting sufficiently tired of the Irish
bogs could not but gladly accept and one of Winters ships returning
to England in the spring of 1581 delivered duly at the quay of Bideford
the body of Don Guzman Maria Magdalena Raleigh after forming for
that summer one of the triumvirate by which Munster was governed after
Ormonds departure at last got his wish and departed for England and
the Court and Amyas was left alone with the snipes and yellow mantles
for two more weary years



CHAPTER X

HOW THE MAYOR OF BIDEFORD BAITED HIS HOOK WITH HIS OWN FLESH

 And therewith he blent and cried ha
 As though he had been stricken to the harte

 Palamon and Arcite

So it befell to Chaucers knight in prison and so it befell also to Don
Guzman and it befell on this wise

He settled down quietly enough at Bideford on his parole in better
quarters than he had occupied for many a day and took things as they
came like a true soldier of fortune till after he had been with
Grenville hardly a month old Salterne the Mayor came to supper

Now Don Guzman however much he might be puzzled at first at our strange
English ways of asking burghers and such lowbred folk to eat and drink
above the salt in the company of noble persons was quite gentleman
enough to know that Richard Grenville was gentleman enough to do only
what was correct and according to the customs and proprieties So after
shrugging the shoulders of his spirit he submitted to eat and drink at
the same board with a tradesman who sat at a desk and made up ledgers
and took apprentices and hearing him talk with Grenville neither
unwisely nor in a vulgar fashion actually before the evening was out
condescended to exchange words with him himself Whereon he found him
a very prudent and courteous person quite aware of the Spaniards
superior rank and making him feel in every sentence that he was aware
thereof and yet holding his own opinion and asserting his own rights
as a wise elder in a fashion which the Spaniard had only seen before
among the merchant princes of Genoa and Venice

At the end of supper Salterne asked Grenville to do his humble roof the
honor etc etc of supping with him the next evening and then turning
to the Don said quite frankly that he knew how great a condescension
it would be on the part of a nobleman of Spain to sit at the board of
a simple merchant but that if the Spaniard deigned to do him such
a favor he would find that the cheer was fit enough for any rank
whatsoever the company might be which invitation Don Guzman being on
the whole glad enough of anything to amuse him graciously condescended
to accept and gained thereby an excellent supper and if he had chosen
to drink it much good wine

Now Mr Salterne was of course as a wise merchant as ready as any man
for an adventure to foreign parts as was afterwards proved by his great
exertions in the settlement of Virginia and he was therefore equally
ready to rack the brains of any guest whom he suspected of knowing
anything concerning strange lands and so he thought no shame first to
try to loose his guests tongue by much good sack and next to ask him
prudent and wellconcocted questions concerning the Spanish Main Peru
the Moluccas China the Indies and all parts

The first of which schemes failed for the Spaniard was as abstemious
as any monk and drank little but water the second succeeded not over
well for the Spaniard was as cunning as any fox and answered little
but wind

In the midst of which tonguefence in came the Rose of Torridge looking
as beautiful as usual and hearing what they were upon added artlessly
enough her questions to her fathers to her Don Guzman could not but
answer and without revealing any very important commercial secrets
gave his host and his hosts daughter a very amusing evening

Now little Eros though spirits like Frank Leighs may choose to call
him as perhaps he really is to them the eldest of the gods and
the son of Jove and Venus yet is reported by other equally good
authorities as Burton has set forth in his Anatomy of Melancholy to
be after all only the child of idleness and fulness of bread To which
scandalous calumny the thoughts of Don Guzmans heart gave at least a
certain color for he being idle as captives needs must be and also
full of bread for Sir Richard kept a very good table had already
looked round for mere amusements sake after some one with whom to fall
in love Lady Grenville as nearest was I blush to say thought of
first but the Spaniard was a man of honor and Sir Richard his host so
he put away from his mind with a selfdenial on which he plumed himself
much the pleasure of a chase equally exciting to his pride and his love
of danger As for the sinfulness of the said chase he of course thought
no more of that than other Southern Europeans did then or than I blush
again to have to say it the English did afterwards in the days of the
Stuarts Nevertheless he had put Lady Grenville out of his mind and so
left room to take Rose Salterne into it not with any distinct purpose
of wronging her but as I said before half to amuse himself and half
too because he could not help it For there was an innocent freshness
about the Rose of Torridge fond as she was of being admired which was
new to him and most attractive The train of the peacock as he
said to himself and yet the heart of the dove made so charming a
combination that if he could have persuaded her to love no one but him
perhaps he might become fool enough to love no one but her And at that
thought he was seized with a very panic of prudence and resolved to
keep out of her way and yet the days ran slowly and Lady Grenville
when at home was stupid enough to talk and think about nothing but her
husband and when she went to Stow and left the Don alone in one corner
of the great house at Bideford what could he do but lounge down to the
buttgardens to show off his fine black cloak and fine black feather
see the shooting have a game or two of rackets with the youngsters a
game or two of bowls with the elders and get himself invited home to
supper by Mr Salterne

And there of course he had it all his own way and ruled the roast
which he was fond enough of doing right royally not only on account
of his rank but because he had something to say worth hearing as a
travelled man For those times were the daydawn of English commerce
and not a merchant in Bideford or in all England but had his
imagination all on fire with projects of discoveries companies
privileges patents and settlements with gallant rivalry of the brave
adventures of Sir Edward Osborne and his new London Company of Turkey
Merchants with the privileges just granted by the Sultan Murad Khan
to the English with the worthy Levant voyages of Roger Bodenham in
the great bark Aucher and of John Fox and Lawrence Aldersey and John
Rule and with hopes from the vast door for Mediterranean trade which
the crushing of the Venetian power at Famagusta in Cyprus and the
alliance made between Elizabeth and the Grand Turk had just thrown
open So not a word could fall from the Spaniard about the Mediterranean
but took root at once in right fertile soil Besides Master Edmund
Hogan had been on a successful embassy to the Emperor of Morocco John
Hawkins and George Fenner had been to Guinea and with the latter Mr
Walter Wren a Bideford man and had traded there for musk and civet
gold and grain and African news was becoming almost as valuable as West
Indian Moreover but two months before had gone from London Captain
Hare in the bark Minion for Brazil and a company of adventurers with
him with Sheffield hardware and Devonshire and Northern kersies
hollands and Manchester cottons for there was a great opening for
English goods by the help of one John Whithall who had married a
Spanish heiress and had an ingenio and slaves in Santos Dont smile
reader or despise the day of small things and those who sowed the seed
whereof you reap the mighty harvest In the meanwhile Drake had proved
not merely the possibility of plundering the American coasts but
of establishing an East Indian trade Frobisher and Davis worthy
forefathers of our Parrys and Franklins had begun to bore their way
upward through the Northern ice in search of a passage to China which
should avoid the dangers of the Spanish seas and Anthony Jenkinson not
the least of English travellers had in sixandtwenty years of travel
in behalf of the Muscovite Company penetrated into not merely Russia
and the Levant but Persia and Armenia Bokhara Tartary Siberia and
those waste Arctic shores where thirty years before the brave Sir Hugh
Willoughby

 In Arzina caught
 Perished with all his crew

Everywhere English commerce under the genial sunshine of Elizabeths
wise rule was spreading and taking root and as Don Guzman talked
with his new friends he soon saw for he was shrewd enough that they
belonged to a race which must be exterminated if Spain intended to
become as she did intend the mistress of the world and that it was
not enough for Spain to have seized in the Popes name the whole new
world and claimed the exclusive right to sail the seas of America not
enough to have crushed the Hollanders not enough to have degraded the
Venetians into her bankers and the Genoese into her mercenaries not
enough to have incorporated into herself with the kingdom of Portugal
the whole East Indian trade of Portugal while these fierce islanders
remained to assert with cunning policy and texts of Scripture and if
they failed with sharp shot and cold steel free seas and free trade
for all the nations upon earth He saw it and his countrymen saw it
too and therefore the Spanish Armada came but of that hereafter And
Don Guzman knew also by hard experience that these same islanders who
sat in Salternes parlor talking broad Devon through their noses were
no mere counters of money and hucksters of goods but men who though
they thoroughly hated fighting and loved making money instead could
fight upon occasion after a very dogged and terrible fashion as well
as the bluest blood in Spain and who sent out their merchant ships
armed up to the teeth and filled with men who had been trained from
childhood to use those arms and had orders to use them without mercy
if either Spaniard Portugal or other created being dared to stop their
moneymaking And one evening he waxed quite mad when after having
civilly enough hinted that if Englishmen came where they had no right to
come they might find themselves sent back again he was answered by a
volley of

Well see that sir

Depends on who says No right

You found might right said another when you claimed the Indian
seas we may find right might when we try them

Try them then gentlemen by all means if it shall so please your
worships and find the sacred flag of Spain as invincible as ever was
the Roman eagle

We have sir Did you ever hear of Francis Drake

Or of George Fenner and the Portugals at the Azores one against
seven

Or of John Hawkins at St Juan dUlloa

You are insolent burghers said Don Guzman and rose to go

Sir said old Salterne as you say we are burghers and plain men
and some of us have forgotten ourselves a little perhaps we must beg
you to forgive our want of manners and to put it down to the strength
of my wine for insolent we never meant to be especially to a noble
gentleman and a foreigner

But the Don would not be pacified and walked out calling himself
an ass and a blinkard for having demeaned himself to such a company
forgetting that he had brought it on himself

Salterne prompted by the great devil Mammon came up to him next day
and begged pardon again promising moreover that none of those who had
been so rude should be henceforth asked to meet him if he would deign
to honor his house once more And the Don actually was appeased and
went there the very next evening sneering at himself the whole time for
going

Fool that I am that girl has bewitched me I believe Go I must and
eat my share of dirt for her sake

So he went and cunningly enough hinted to old Salterne that he
had taken such a fancy to him and felt so bound by his courtesy and
hospitality that he might not object to tell him things which he would
not mention to every one for that the Spaniards were not jealous of
single traders but of any general attempt to deprive them of their
hardearned wealth that however in the meanwhile there were plenty
of opportunities for one man here and there to enrich himself etc

Old Salterne shrewd as he was had his weak point and the Spaniard had
touched it and delighted at this opportunity of learning the mysteries
of the Spanish monopoly he often actually set Rose on to draw out the
Don without a fear so blind does money make men lest she might be
herself drawn in For first he held it as impossible that she would
think of marrying a Popish Spaniard as of marrying the man in the moon
and next as impossible that he would think of marrying a burghers
daughter as of marrying a negress and trusted that the religion of the
one and the family pride of the other would keep them as separate as
beings of two different species And as for love without marriage if
such a possibility ever crossed him the thought was rendered absurd
on Roses part by her virtue on which the old roan and rightly would
have staked every farthing he had on earth and on the Dons part by a
certain human fondness for the continuity of the carotid artery and the
parts adjoining for which and that not altogether justly seeing
that Don Guzman cared as little for his own life as he did for his
neighbors Mr Salterne gave him credit And so it came to pass that
for weeks and months the merchants house was the Dons favorite haunt
and he saw the Rose of Torridge daily and the Rose of Torridge heard
him

And as for her poor child she had never seen such a man He had or
seemed to have all the highbred grace of Frank and yet he was cast in
a manlier mould he had just enough of his nations proud selfassertion
to make a woman bow before him as before a superior and yet tact enough
to let it very seldom degenerate into that boastfulness of which the
Spaniards were then so often and so justly accused He had marvels to
tell by flood and field as many and more than Amyas and he told
them with a grace and an eloquence of which modest simple old Amyas
possessed nothing Besides he was on the spot and the Leighs were not
nor indeed were any of her old lovers and what could she do but amuse
herself with the only person who came to hand

So thought in time more ladies than she for the country the north of
it at least was all but bare just then of young gallants what with the
Netherland wars and the Irish wars and the Spaniard became soon welcome
at every house for many a mile round and made use of his welcome so
freely and received so much unwonted attention from fair young dames
that his head might have been a little turned and Rose Salterne have
thereby escaped had not Sir Richard delicately given him to understand
that in spite of the free and easy manners of English ladies brothers
were just as jealous and ladies honors at least as inexpugnable as
in the land of demureness and duennas Don Guzman took the hint well
enough and kept on good terms with the country gentlemen as with their
daughters and to tell the truth the cunning soldier of fortune found
his account in being intimate with all the ladies he could in order to
prevent old Salterne from fancying that he had any peculiar predilection
for Mistress Rose

Nevertheless Mr Salternes parlor being nearest to him still remained
his most common haunt where while he discoursed for hours about

 Antres vast and deserts idle
 And of the cannibals that each other eat
 Of Anthropophagi and men whose heads
 Do grow beneath their shoulders

to the boundless satisfaction of poor Roses fancy he took care to
season his discourse with scraps of mercantile information which kept
the old merchant always expectant and hankering for more and made it
worth his while to ask the Spaniard in again and again

And his stories certainly were worth hearing He seemed to have been
everywhere and to have seen everything born in Peru and sent home to
Spain at ten years old brought up in Italy a soldier in the Levant an
adventurer to the East Indies again in America first in the islands
and then in Mexico Then back again to Spain and thence to Rome and
thence to Ireland Shipwrecked captive among savages looking down the
craters of volcanoes hanging about all the courts of Europe fighting
Turks Indians lions elephants alligators and what not At
fiveandthirty he had seen enough for three lives and knew how to make
the best of what he had seen

He had shared as a lad in the horrors of the memorable siege of
Famagusta and had escaped he hardly knew himself how from the hands
of the victorious Turks and from the certainty if he escaped being
flayed alive or impaled as most of the captive officers were of ending
his life as a Janissary at the Sultans court He had been at the Battle
of the Three Kings had seen Stukely borne down by a hundred lances
unconquered even in death and had held upon his knee the head of the
dying King of Portugal

And now as he said to Rose one evening what had he left on earth but
a heart trampled as hard as the pavement Whom had he to love Who loved
him He had nothing for which to live but fame and even that was denied
to him a prisoner in a foreign land

Had he no kindred then asked pitying Rose

My two sisters are in a conventthey had neither money nor beauty
so they are dead to me My brother is a Jesuit so he is dead to me My
father fell by the hands of Indians in Mexico my mother a penniless
widow is companion duennawhatsoever they may choose to call
itcarrying fans and lapdogs for some princess or other there in
Seville of no better blood than herself and Idevil I have lost even
my swordand so fares the house of De Soto

Don Guzman of course intended to be pitied and pitied he was
accordingly And then he would turn the conversation and begin telling
Italian stories after the Italian fashion according to his auditory
the pathetic ones when Rose was present the racy ones when she was
absent so that Rose had wept over the sorrows of Juliet and Desdemona
and over many another moving tale long before they were ever enacted
on an English stage and the ribs of the Bideford worthies had shaken to
many a jest which Cinthio and Bandellos ghosts must come and make for
themselves over again if they wish them to be remembered for I shall
lend them no shove toward immortality

And so on and so on What need of more words Before a year was out
Rose Salterne was far more in love with Don Guzman than he with her and
both suspected each others mind though neither hinted at the truth
she from fear and he to tell the truth from sheer Spanish pride of
blood For he soon began to find out that he must compromise that blood
by marrying the heretic burghers daughter or all his labor would be
thrown away

He had seen with much astonishment and then practised with much
pleasure that graceful old English fashion of saluting every lady on
the cheek at meeting which like the old Dutch fashion of asking young
ladies out to feasts without their mothers used to give such cause of
brutal calumny and scandal to the coarse minds of Romish visitors from
the Continent and he had seen too fuming with jealous rage more than
one Bideford burgher redolent of onions profane in that way the velvet
cheek of Rose Salterne

So one day he offered his salute in like wise but he did it when she
was alone for something within perhaps a guilty conscience whispered
that it might be hardly politic to make the proffer in her fathers
presence however to his astonishment he received a prompt though
quiet rebuff

No sir you should know that my cheek is not for you

Why said he stifling his anger it seems free enough to every
counterjumper in the town

Was it love or simple innocence which made her answer apologetically

True Don Guzman but they are my equals

And I

You are a nobleman sir and should recollect that you are one

Well said he forcing a sneer it is a strange taste to prefer the
shopkeeper

Prefer said she forcing a laugh in her turn it is a mere form
among us They are nothing to me I can tell you

And I then less than nothing

Rose turned very red but she had nerve to answer

And why should you be anything to me You have condescended too much
sir already to us in giving us many amany a pleasant evening You
must condescend no further You wrong yourself sir and me too No
sir not a step nearerI will not A salute between equals means
nothing but between you and meI vow sir if you do not leave me this
moment I will complain to my father

Do so madam I care as little for your fathers anger as you for my
misery

Cruel cried Rose trembling from head to foot

I love you madam cried he throwing himself at her feet I adore
you Never mention differences of rank to me more for I have forgotten
them forgotten all but love all but you madam My light my lodestar
my princess my goddess You see where my pride is gone remember I
plead as a suppliant a beggarthough one who may be one day a prince
a king ay and a prince now a very Lucifer of pride to all except to
you to you a wretch who grovels at your feet and cries Have mercy
on me on my loneliness my homelessness my friendlessness Ah Rose
madam I should have said forgive the madness of my passion you know
not the heart which you break Cold Northerns you little dream how a
Spaniard can love Love Worship rather as I worship you madam as
I bless the captivity which brought me the sight of you and the ruin
which first made me rich Is it possible saints and Virgin do my own
tears deceive my eyes or are there tears too in those radiant orbs

Go sir cried poor Rose recovering herself suddenly and let me
never see you more And as a last chance for life she darted out of
the room

Your slave obeys you madam and kisses your hands and feet forever
and a day said the cunning Spaniard and drawing himself up walked
serenely out of the house while she poor fool peeped after him out
of her window upstairs and her heart sank within her as she watched his
jaunty and careless air

How much of that rhapsody of his was honest how much premeditated I
cannot tell though she poor child began to fancy that it was all a
set speech when she found that he had really taken her at her word and
set foot no more within her fathers house So she reproached herself
for the cruelest of women settled that if he died she should be his
murderess watched for him to pass at the window in hopes that he might
look up and then hid herself in terror the moment he appeared round
the corner and so forth and so forthone lovemaking is very like
another and has been so I suppose since that first blessed marriage
in Paradise when Adam and Eve made no love at all but found it
readymade for them from heaven and really it is fiddling while Rome
is burning to spend more pages over the sorrows of poor little Rose
Salterne while the destinies of Europe are hanging on the marriage
between Elizabeth and Anjou and Sir Humphrey Gilbert is stirring heaven
and earth and Devonshire of course as the most important portion
of the said earth to carry out his dormant patent which will give to
England in due time we are not jesting now Newfoundland Nova Scotia
and Canada and the Northern States and to Humphrey Gilbert himself
something better than a new world namely another world and a crown of
glory therein which never fades away



CHAPTER XI

HOW EUSTACE LEIGH MET THE POPES LEGATE

 Misguided rash intruding fool farewell
 Thou seest to be too busy is some danger

 Hamlet

It is the spring of 15823 The gray March skies are curdling hard and
high above black mountain peaks The keen March wind is sweeping harsh
and dry across a dreary sheet of bog still red and yellow with the
stains of winter frost One brown knoll alone breaks the waste and on
it a few leafless windclipt oaks stretch their mossgrown arms like
giant hairy spiders above a desolate pool which crisps and shivers in
the biting breeze while from beside its brink rises a mournful cry and
sweeps down faint and fitful amid the howling of the wind

Along the brink of the bog picking their road among crumbling rocks and
green spongy springs a company of English soldiers are pushing fast
clad capapie in helmet and quilted jerkin with arquebus on shoulder
and pikes trailing behind them stern steadfast men who two years
since were working the guns at Smerwick fort and have since then seen
many a bloody fray and shall see more before they die Two captains
ride before them on shaggy ponies the taller in armor stained and
rusted with many a storm and fray the other in brilliant inlaid cuirass
and helmet gaudy sash and plume and sword hilt glittering with gold
a quaint contrast enough to the meager garron which carries him and his
finery Beside them secured by a cord which a pikeman has fastened to
his own wrist trots a barelegged Irish kerne whose only clothing is
his ragged yellow mantle and the unkempt glib of hair through which
his eyes peer out right and left in mingled fear and sullenness He is
the guide of the company in their hunt after the rebel Baltinglas and
woe to him if he play them false

A pleasant country truly Captain Raleigh says the dingy officer to
the gay one I wonder how having once escaped from it to Whitehall
you have the courage to come back and spoil that gay suit with bogwater
and mud

A very pleasant country my friend Amyas what you say in jest I say
in earnest

Hillo Our tastes have changed places I am sick of it already as you
foretold Would Heaven that I could hear of some adventure Westwardho
and find these big bones swinging in a hammock once more Pray what has
made you so suddenly in love with bog and rock that you come back to
tramp them with us I thought you had spied out the nakedness of the
land long ago

Bog and rock Nakedness of the land What is needed here but prudence
and skill justice and law This soil see is fat enough if men were
here to till it These rockswho knows what minerals they may hold I
hear of gold and jewels found already in divers parts and Daniel my
brother Humphreys German assayer assures me that these rocks are of
the very same kind as those which yield the silver in Peru Tut man
if her gracious majesty would but bestow on me some few square miles of
this same wilderness in seven years time I would make it blossom like
the rose by Gods good help

Humph I should be more inclined to stay here then

So you shall and be my agent if you will to get in my minerents and
my cornrents and my fisheryrents eh Could you keep accounts old
knight of the bearspaw

Well enough for such short reckonings as yours would be on the profit
side at least No noId sooner carry lime all my days from Cauldy to
Bideford than pass another twelvemonth in the land of Ire among
the children of wrath There is a curse upon the face of the earth I
believe

There is no curse upon it save the old one of mans sinThorns and
thistles it shall bring forth to thee But if you root up the thorns
and thistles Amyas I know no fiend who can prevent your growing wheat
instead and if you till the ground like a man you plough and barrow
away natures curse and other fables of the schoolmen beside added
he in that daring fashion which afterwards obtained for him and never
did good Christian less deserve it the imputation of atheism

It is sword and bullet I think that are needed here before plough
and harrow to clear away some of the curse Until a few more of these
Irish lords are gone where the Desmonds are there is no peace for
Ireland

Humph not so far wrong I fear And yetIrish lords These very
traitors are better English blood than we who hunt them down When Yeo
here slew the Desmond the other day he no more let out a drop of Irish
blood than if he had slain the lord deputy himself

His blood be on his own head said Yeo He looked as wild a savage as
the worst of them more shame to him and the ancient here had nigh cut
off his arm before he told us who he was and then your worship having
a price upon his head and like to bleed to death too

Enough enough good fellow said Raleigh Thou hast done what was
given thee to do Strange Amyas is it not Noble Normans sunk into
savagesHibernis ipsis hiberniores Is there some uncivilizing venom in
the air

Some venom at least which makes English men traitors But the Irish
themselves are well enough if their tyrants would let them be See now
what more faithful liegeman has her majesty than the Inchiquin who
they say is Prince of Themond and should be king of all Ireland if
every man had his right

Dont talk of rights in the land of wrongs man But the Inchiquin
knows well that the true Irish Esau has no worse enemy than his
supplanter the Norman Jacob And yet Amyas are even these men worse
than we might be if we had been bred up masters over the bodies and
souls of men in some remote land where law and order had never come
Look at this Desmond brought up a savage among savages a Papist among
Papists a despot among slaves a thousand easy maidens deeming it honor
to serve his pleasure a thousand wild ruffians deeming it piety to
fulfil his revenge and let him that is without sin among us cast the
first stone

Ay went on Raleigh to himself as the conversation dropped What
hadst thou been Raleigh hadst thou been that Desmond whose lands thou
now desirest What wilt thou be when thou hast them Will thy children
sink downwards as these noble barons sank Will the genius of tyranny
and falsehood find soil within thy heart to grow and ripen fruit What
guarantee hast thou for doing better here than those who went before
thee And yet cannot I do justice and love mercy Can I not establish
plantations build and sow and make the desert valleys laugh with corn
Shall I not have my Spenser with me to fill me with all noble thoughts
and raise my soul to his heroic pitch Is not this true knighterrantry
to redeem to peace and use and to the glory of that glorious queen whom
God has given to me a generous soil and a more generous race Trustful
and tenderhearted they arenone more and if they be fickle and
passionate will not that very softness of temper which makes them so
easily led to evil make them as easy to be led towards good Yeshere
away from courts among a people who should bless me as their benefactor
and delivererwhat golden days might be mine And yetis this but
another angels mask from that same cunning fiend ambitions stage And
will my house be indeed the house of God the foundations of which are
loyalty and its bulwarks righteousness and not the house of fame
whose walls are of the soapbubble and its floor a sea of glass mingled
with fire I would be good and greatWhen will the day come when I
shall be content to be good and yet not great like this same simple
Leigh toiling on by my side to do his duty with no more thought for
the morrow than the birds of God Greatness I have tasted that cup
within the last twelve months do I not know that it is sweet in the
mouth but bitter in the belly Greatness And was not Essex great and
John of Austria great and Desmond great whose race but three
short years ago had stood for ages higher than I shall ever hope to
climbcastles and lands and slaves by thousands and five hundred
gentlemen of his name who had vowed to forswear God before they
forswore him and well have they kept their vow And now dead in a
turfhovel like a coney in a burrow Leigh what noise was that

An Irish howl I fancied but it came from off the bog it may be only
a plovers cry

Something not quite right sir captain to my mind said the ancient
They have ugly stories here of pucks and banshees and what not of
ghosts There it was again wailing just like a woman They say the
banshee cried all night before Desmond was slain

Perhaps then this one may be crying for Baltinglas for his turn is
likely to come nextnot that I believe in such old wives tales

Shamus my man said Amyas to the guide do you hear that cry in the
bog

The guide put on the most stolid of faces and answered in broken
English

Shamus hear naught Perhapswhat you call himfishing in ta pool

An otter he means and I believe he is right Stay no Did you not
hear it then Shamus It was a womans voice

Shamus is shick in his ears ever since Christmas

Shamus will go after Desmond if he lies said Amyas Ancient we had
better send a few men to see what it is there may be a poor soul taken
by robbers or perhaps starving to death as I have seen many a one

And I too poor wretches and by no fault of their own or ours either
but if their lords will fall to quarrelling and then drive each others
cattle and waste each others lands sir you know

I know said Amyas impatiently why dost not take the men and go

Cry you mercy noble captain butI fear nothing born of woman

Well what of that said Amyas with a smile

But these pucks sir The wild Irish do say that they haunt the pools
and they do no manner of harm sir when you are coming up to them but
when you are past sir they jump on your back like to apes sirand
who can tackle that manner of fiend

Why then by thine own showing ancient said Raleigh thou mayst
go and see all safely enough and then if the puck jumps on thee as thou
comest back just run in with him here and Ill buy him of thee for a
noble or thou mayst keep him in a cage and make money in London by
showing him for a monster

Good heavens forefend Captain Raleigh but you talk rashly But if I
must Captain Leigh

 Where duty calls
 To brazen walls
 How base the slave who flinches

Lads wholl follow me

Thou askest for volunteers as if thou wert to lead a forlorn hope
Pull away at the usquebaugh man and swallow Dutch courage since thine
English is oozed away Stay Ill go myself

And I with you said Raleigh As the queens true knighterrant I
am bound to be behindhand in no adventure Who knows but we may find a
wicked magician just going to cut off the head of some saffronmantled
princess and he dismounted

Oh sirs sirs to endanger your precious

Pooh said Raleigh I wear an amulet and have a spell of artmagic
at my tongues end whereby sir ancient neither can a ghost see me
nor I see them Come with us Yeo the Desmondslayer and we will shame
the devil or be shamed by him

He may shame me sir but he will never frighten me quoth Yeo but
the bog captains

Tut Devonshire men and heathtrotters born and not know our way over
a peat moor

And the three strode away

They splashed and scrambled for some quarter of a mile to the knoll
while the cry became louder and louder as they neared

Thats neither ghost nor otter sirs but a true Irish howl as Captain
Leigh said and Ill warrant Master Shamus knew as much long ago said
Yeo

And in fact they could now hear plainly the Ochone Ochonorie of
some wild woman and scrambling over the boulders of the knoll in
another minute came full upon her

She was a young girl sluttish and unkempt of course but fair enough
her only covering as usual was the ample yellow mantle There she sat
upon a stone tearing her black dishevelled hair and every now and then
throwing up her head and bursting into a long mournful cry for all
the world as Yeo said like a dumb fourfooted hound and not a
Christian soul

On her knees lay the head of a man of middle age in the long soutane of
a Romish priest One look at the attitude of his limbs told them that he
was dead

The two paused in awe and Raleighs spirit susceptible of all poetical
images felt keenly that strange scenethe bleak and bitter sky the
shapeless bog the stunted trees the savage girl alone with the corpse
in that utter desolation And as she bent her head over the still face
and called wildly to him who heard her not and then utterly unmindful
of the intruders sent up again that dreary wail into the dreary air
they felt a sacred horror which almost made them turn away and leave
her unquestioned but Yeo whose nerves were of tougher fibre asked
quietly

Shall I go and search the fellow captain

Better I think said Amyas

Raleigh went gently to the girl and spoke to her in English She looked
up at him his armor and his plume with wide and wondering eyes and
then shook her head and returned to her lamentation

Raleigh gently laid his hand on her arm and lifted her up while Yeo
and Amyas bent over the corpse

It was the body of a large and coarsefeatured man but wasted and
shrunk as if by famine to a very skeleton The hands and legs were
cramped up and the trunk bowed together as if the man had died of cold
or famine Yeo drew back the clothes from the thin bosom while the girl
screamed and wept but made no effort to stop him

Ask her who it is Yeo you know a little Irish said Amyas

He asked but the girl made no answer The stubborn jade wont tell of
course sir If she were but a man Id make her soon enough

Ask her who killed him

No one she says and I believe she says true for I can find no wound
The man has been starved sirs as I am a sinful man God help him
though he is a priest and yet he seems full enough down below Whats
here A big pouch sirs stuffed full of somewhat

Hand it hither

The two opened the pouch papers papers but no scrap of food Then a
parchment They unrolled it

Latin said Amyas you must construe Don Scholar

Is it possible said Raleigh after reading a moment This is indeed
a prize This is Saunders himself

Yeo sprang up from the body as if he had touched an adder Nick
Saunders the Legacy sir

Nicholas Saunders the legate

The villain why did not he wait for me to have the comfort of killing
him Dog and he kicked the corpse with his foot

Quiet quiet Remember the poor girl said Amyas as she shrieked at
the profanation while Raleigh went on half to himself

Yes this is Saunders Misguided fool and this is the end To this
thou hast come with thy plotting and thy conspiring thy lying and thy
boasting consecrated banners and Popes bulls Agnus Deis and holy
waters the blessing of all saints and angels and thy Lady of the
Immaculate Conception Thou hast called on the heavens to judge between
thee and us and here is their answer What is that in his hand Amyas
Give it me A pastoral epistle to the Earl of Ormond and all nobles of
the realm of Ireland To all who groan beneath the loathsome tyranny
of an illegitimate adulteress etc Nicholas Saunders by the grace
of God Legate etc Bah and this forsooth was thy last meditation
Incorrigible pedant Victrix causa Diis placuit sed victa Catoni

He ran his eye through various other documents written in the usual
strain full of huge promises from the Pope and the king of Spain
frantic and filthy slanders against Elizabeth Burghley Leicester
Essex the elder Sidney and every great and good man never mind
of which party who then upheld the commonweal bombastic attempts to
terrify weak consciences by denouncing endless fire against those who
opposed the true faith fulsome ascriptions of martyrdom and sanctity to
every rebel and traitor who had been hanged for the last twenty
years wearisome arguments about the bull In Caena Domini Elizabeths
excommunication the nullity of English law the sacred duty of
rebellion the right to kill a prince impenitently heretical and the
like insanities and villainies which may be read at large in Camden
the Phoenix Britannicus Foxs Martyrs or surest of all in the
writings of the worthies themselves

With a gesture of disgust Raleigh crammed the foul stuff back again
into the pouch Taking it with them they walked back to the company
and then remounting marched away once more towards the lands of the
Desmonds and the girl was left alone with the dead

An hour had passed when another Englishman was standing by the wailing
girl and round him a dozen shockheaded kernes skene on thigh and
javelin in hand were tossing about their tawny rags and adding their
lamentations to those of the lonely watcher

The Englishman was Eustace Leigh a layman still but still at his old
work By two years of intrigue and labor from one end of Ireland to the
other he had been trying to satisfy his conscience for rejecting the
higher calling of the celibate for mad hopes still lurked within that
fiery heart His brow was wrinkled now his features harshened the
scar upon his face and the slight distortion which accompanied it was
hidden by a bushy beard from all but himself and he never forgot it for
a day nor forgot who had given it to him

He had been with Desmond wandering in moor and moss for many a month
in danger of his life and now he was on his way to James FitzEustace
Lord Baltinglas to bring him the news of Desmonds death and with
him a remnant of the clan who were either too stouthearted or too
desperately stained with crime to seek peace from the English and as
their fellows did find it at once and freely

There Eustace stood looking down on all that was left of the most
sacred personage of Ireland the man who as he once had hoped was to
regenerate his native land and bring the proud island of the West once
more beneath that gentle yoke in which united Christendom labored for
the commonweal of the universal Church There he was and with him all
Eustaces dreams in the very heart of that country which he had vowed
and believed as he vowed was ready to rise in arms as one man even to
the baby at the breast so he had said in vengeance against the Saxon
heretic and sweep the hated name of Englishman into the deepest abysses
of the surge which walled her coasts with Spain and the Pope to back
him and the wealth of the Jesuits at his command in the midst
of faithful Catholics valiant soldiers noblemen who had pledged
themselves to die for the cause serfs who worshipped him as a
demigodstarved to death in a bog It was a pretty plain verdict on the
reasonableness of his expectations but not to Eustace Leigh

It was a failure of course but it was an accident indeed to have
been expected in a wicked world whose prince and master as all
knew was the devil himself indeed proof of the righteousness of
the causefor when had the true faith been other than persecuted and
trampled under foot If one came to think of it with eyes purified from
the tears of carnal impatience what was it but a glorious martyrdom

Blest Saunders murmured Eustace Leigh let me die the death of the
righteous and let my last end he like this Ora pro me most excellent
martyr while I dig thy grave upon this lonely moor to wait there for
thy translation to one of those stately shrines which cemented by the
blood of such as thee shall hereafter rise restored toward heaven to
make this land once more The Isle of Saints

The corpse was buried a few prayers said hastily and Eustace Leigh was
away again not now to find Baltinglas for it was more than his life
was worth The girl had told him of the English soldiers who had passed
and he knew that they would reach the earl probably before he did The
game was up all was lost So he retraced his steps as a desperate
resource to the last place where he would be looked for and after a
month of disguising hiding and other expedients found himself again
in his native county of Devon while FitzEustace Viscount Baltinglas
had taken ship for Spain having got little by his famous argument
to Ormond in behalf of his joining the Church of Rome Had not thine
ancestor blessed Thomas of Canterbury died for the Church of Rome
thou hadst never been Earl of Ormond The premises were certainly
sounder than those of his party were wont to be for it was to expiate
the murder of that turbulent hero that the Ormond lands had been granted
by Henry II but as for the conclusion therefrom it was much on a par
with the rest

And now let us return to Raleigh and Amyas as they jog along their
weary road They have many things to talk of for it is but three days
since they met

Amyas as you see is coming fast into Raleighs old opinion of Ireland
Raleigh under the inspiration of a possible grant of Desmonds lands
looks on bogs and rocks transfigured by his own hopes and fancy as if
by the glory of a rainbow He looked at all things so noble fellow
even thirty years after when old worn out and ruined well for him
had it been otherwise and his heart had grown old with his head Amyas
who knows nothing about Desmonds lands is puzzled at the change

Why what is this Raleigh You are like children sitting in the
marketplace and nothing pleases you You wanted to get to Court and
you have got there and are lord and master I hear or something very
like it alreadyand as soon as fortune stuffs your mouth full of
sweetmeats do you turn informer on her

Raleigh laughed insignificantly but was silent

And how is your friend Mr Secretary Spenser who was with us at
Smerwick

Spenser He has thriven even as I have and he has found as I have
that in making one friend at Court you make ten foes but Oderint dum
metuant is no more my motto than his Leigh I want to be greatgreat
I am already they say if princes favor can swell the frog into an ox
but I want to be liked lovedI want to see people smile when I enter

So they do Ill warrant said Amyas

So do hyenas said Raleigh grin because they are hungry and I may
throw them a bone Ill throw you one now old lad or rather a good
sirloin of beef for the sake of your smile Thats honest at least
Ill warrant whosoevers else is not Have you heard of my brother
Humphreys new project

How should I hear anything in this waste howling wilderness

Kiss hands to the wilderness then and come with me to Newfoundland

You to Newfoundland

Yes I to Newfoundland unless my little matter here is settled at
once Gloriana dont know it and shant till Im off Shed send me to
the Tower I think if she caught me playing truant I could hardly get
leave to come hither but I must out and try my fortune I am over ears
in debt already and sick of courts and courtiers Humphrey must go next
spring and take possession of his kingdom beyond seas or his patent
expires and with him I go and you too my circumnavigating giant

And then Raleigh expounded to Amyas the details of the great
Newfoundland scheme which whoso will may read in the pages of Hakluyt

Sir Humphrey Gilbert Raleighs halfbrother held a patent for
planting the lands of Newfoundland and Meta Incognita Labrador
He had attempted a voyage thither with Raleigh in 1578 whereof I never
could find any news save that he came back again after a heavy brush
with some Spanish ships in which his best captain Mr Morgan was
killed having done nothing and much impaired his own estate but now
he had collected a large sum Sir Gilbert Peckham of London Mr Hayes
of South Devon and various other gentlemen of whom more hereafter had
adventured their money and a considerable colony was to be sent out the
next year with miners assayers and what was more Parmenius Budaeus
Franks old friend who had come to England full of thirst to see the
wonders of the New World and over and above this as Raleigh told Amyas
in strictest secrecy Adrian Gilbert Humphreys brother was turning
every stone at Court for a patent of discovery in the NorthWest
and this Newfoundland colony though it was to produce gold silver
merchandise and what not was but a basis of operations a halfway
house from whence to work out the NorthWest passage to the Indiesthat
golden dream as fatal to English valor as the Guiana one to
Spanishand yet hardly hardly to be regretted when we remember the
seamanship the science the chivalry the heroism unequalled in the
history of the English nation which it has called forth among those
our later Arctic voyagers who have combined the knighterrantry of the
middle age with the practical prudence of the modern and dared for duty
more than Cortez or Pizarro dared for gold

Amyas simple fellow took all in greedily he knew enough of the
dangers of the Magellan passage to appreciate the boundless value of a
road to the East Indies which would as all supposed then save half the
distance and be as it were a private possession of the English safe
from Spanish interference and he listened reverently to Sir Humphreys
quaint proofs half true half fantastic of such a passage which
Raleigh detailed to himof the Primum Mobile and its diurnal motion
from east to west in obedience to which the seacurrent flowed westward
ever round the Cape of Good Hope and being unable to pass through the
narrow strait between South America and the Antarctic Continent rushed
up the American shore as the Gulf Stream and poured northwestward
between Greenland and Labrador towards Cathay and India of that most
crafty argument of Sir Humphreyshow Aristotle in his book De Mundo
and Simon Gryneus in his annotations thereon declare that the world
the Old World is an island compassed by that which Homer calls the
river Oceanus ergo the New World is an island also and there is
a NorthWest passage of the three brothers names unknown who had
actually made the voyage and named what was afterwards called Daviss
Strait after themselves of the Indians who were cast ashore in Germany
in the reign of Frederic Barbarossa who as Sir Humphrey had learnedly
proved per modum tollendi could have come only by the NorthWest and
above all of Salvaterra the Spaniard who in 1568 had told Sir Henry
Sidney Philips father there in Ireland how he had spoken with a
Mexican friar named Urdaneta who had himself come from Mar del Zur the
Pacific into Germany by that very NorthWest passage at which last
Amyas shook his head and said that friars were liars and seeing
believing but if you must needs have an adventure you insatiable soul
you why not try for the golden city of Manoa

Manoa asked Raleigh who had heard as most had dim rumors of the
place What do you know of it

Whereon Amyas told him all that he had gathered from the Spaniard and
Raleigh in his turn believed every word

Humph said he after a long silence To find that golden emperor
offer him help and friendship from the queen of England defend him
against the Spaniards if we became strong enough conquer back all Peru
from the Popish tyrants and reinstate him on the throne of the Incas
with ourselves for his bodyguard as the Norman Varangians were to
the effeminate emperors of ByzantHey Amyas You would make a gallant
chieftain of Varangs Well do it lad

Well try said Amyas but we must be quick for theres one Berreo
sworn to carry out the quest to the death and if the Spaniards once get
thither their plan of works will be much more like Pizarros than like
yours and by the time we come there will be neither gold nor city
left

Nor Indians either Ill warrant the butchers but lad I am promised
to Humphrey I have a bark fitting out already and all I have and
more adventured in her so Manoa must wait

It will wait well enough if the Spaniards prosper no better on the
Amazon than they have done but must I come with you To tell the truth
I am quite shoresick and to sea I must go What will my mother say

Ill manage thy mother said Raleigh and so he did for to cut a
long story short he went back the month after and he not only took
home letters from Amyas to his mother but so impressed on that good
lady the enormous profits and honors to be derived from Meta Incognita
and which was most true the advantage to any young man of sailing
with such a general as Humphrey Gilbert most pious and most learned of
seamen and of cavaliers beloved and honored above all his compeers by
Queen Elizabeth that she consented to Amyass adventuring in the
voyage some two hundred pounds which had come to him as his share of
prizemoney after the ever memorable circumnavigation For Mrs
Leigh be it understood was no longer at Burrough Court By Franks
persuasion she had let the old place moved up to London with her
eldest son and taken for herself a lodging somewhere by Palace Stairs
which looked out upon the silver Thames for Thames was silver then
with its busy ferries and gliding boats across to the pleasant fields
of Lambeth and the Archbishops palace and the wooded Surrey hills
and there she spent her peaceful days close to her Frank and to the
Court Elizabeth would have had her reenter it offering her a small
place in the household but she declined saying that she was too old
and heartweary for aught but prayer So by prayer she lived under the
sheltering shadow of the tall minster where she went morn and even to
worship and to entreat for the two in whom her heart was bound up and
Frank slipped in every day if but for five minutes and brought with him
Spenser or Raleigh or Dyer or Budaeus or sometimes Sidneys self and
there was talk of high and holy things of which none could speak better
than could she and each guest went from that hallowed room a humbler
and yet a loftier man So slipped on the peaceful months and few
and far between came Irish letters for Ireland was then farther from
Westminster than is the Black Sea now but those were days in which
wives and mothers had learned as they have learned once more sweet
souls to walk by faith and not by sight for those they love and Mrs
Leigh was content though when was she not content to hear that Amyas
was winning a good report as a brave and prudent officer sober just
and faithful beloved and obeyed alike by English soldiers and Irish
kernes

Those two years and the one which followed were the happiest which she
had known since her husbands death But the cloud was fast coming up
the horizon though she saw it not A little longer and the sun would
be hid for many a wintry day

Amyas went to Plymouth with Yeo of course at his heels and there
beheld for the first time the majestic countenance of the philosopher
of Compton castle He lodged with Drake and found him not oversanguine
as to the success of the voyage

For learning and manners Amyas theres not his equal and the queen
may well love him and Devon be proud of him but booklearning is not
business booklearning didnt get me round the world booklearning
didnt make Captain Hawkins nor his father neither the best
shipbuilders from Hull to Cadiz and booklearning I very much fear
wont plant Newfoundland

However the die was cast and the little fleet of five sail assembled
in Cawsand Bay Amyas was to go as a gentleman adventurer on board of
Raleighs bark Raleigh himself however at the eleventh hour had been
forbidden by the queen to leave England Ere they left Sir Humphrey
Gilberts picture was painted by some Plymouth artist to be sent up to
Elizabeth in answer to a letter and a gift sent by Raleigh which as a
specimen of the men and of the time I here transcribe


BROTHERI have sent you a token from her Majesty an anchor guided
by a lady as you see And further her Highness willed me to send you
word that she wisheth you as great good hap and safety to your ship as
if she were there in person desiring you to have care of yourself as of
that which she tendereth and therefore for her sake you must provide
for it accordingly Furthermore she commandeth that you leave your
picture with her For the rest I leave till our meeting or to the
report of the bearer who would needs be the messenger of this good
news So I commit you to the will and protection of God who send us
such life and death as he shall please or hath appointed

Richmond this Friday morning

Your true Brother

W RALEIGH

  This letter was a few years since in the possession of Mr
 Pomeroy Gilbert fortmajor at Dartmouth a descendant of
 the admirals

Who would not die sir for such a woman said Sir Humphrey and he
said truly as he showed that letter to Amyas

Who would not But she bids you rather live for her

I shall do both young man and for God too I trust We are going in
Gods cause we go for the honor of Gods Gospel for the deliverance of
poor infidels led captive by the devil for the relief of my distressed
countrymen unemployed within this narrow isle and to God we commit our
cause We fight against the devil himself and stronger is He that is
within us than he that is against us

Some say that Raleigh himself came down to Plymouth accompanied the
fleet a days sail to sea and would have given her majesty the slip
and gone with them Westwardho but for Sir Humphreys advice It is
likely enough but I cannot find evidence for it At all events on the
11th June the fleet sailed out having says Mr Hayes in number about
260 men among whom we had of every faculty good choice as shipwrights
masons carpenters smiths and such like requisite for such an action
also mineral men and refiners Beside for solace of our people and
allurement of the savages we were provided of musique in good variety
not omitting the least toys as morrisdancers hobbyhorses and
Maylike conceits to delight the savage people whom we intended to win
by all fair means possible An armament complete enough even to that
tenderness towards the Indians which is so striking a feature of
the Elizabethan seamen called out in them perhaps by horror at the
Spanish cruelties as well as by their more liberal creed and to the
daily service of God on board of every ship according to the simple
old instructions of Captain John Hawkins to one of his little squadrons
Keep good company beware of fire serve God daily and love one
anotheran armament in short complete in all but men The sailors
had been picked up hastily and anywhere and soon proved themselves a
mutinous and in the case of the bark Swallow a piratical set The
mechanics were little better The gentlemenadventurers puffed up with
vain hopes of finding a new Mexico became soon disappointed and surly
at the hard practical reality while over all was the head of a sage and
an enthusiast a man too noble to suspect others and too pure to
make allowances for poor dirty human weaknesses He had got his scheme
perfect upon paper well for him and for his company if he had asked
Francis Drake to translate it for him into fact As early as the second
day the seeds of failure began to sprout above ground The men of
Raleighs bark the ViceAdmiral suddenly found themselves seized or
supposed themselves seized with a contagious sickness and at midnight
forsook the fleet and went back to Plymouth whereto Mr Hayes can only
say The reason I never could understand Sure I am that Mr Raleigh
spared no cost in setting them forth And so I leave it unto God

But Amyas said more He told Butler the captain plainly that if the
bark went back he would not that he had seen enough of ships deserting
their consorts that it should never be said of him that he had followed
Winters example and that too on a fair easterly wind and finally
that he had seen Doughty hanged for trying to play such a trick and
that he might see others hanged too before he died Whereon Captain
Butler offered to draw and fight to which Amyas showed no repugnance
whereon the captain having taken a second look at Amyass thews and
sinews reconsidered the matter and offered to put Amyas on board of
Sir Humphreys Delight if he could find a crew to row him

Amyas looked around

Are there any of Sir Francis Drakes men on board

Three sir said Yeo Robert Drew and two others

Pelicans roared Amyas you have been round the world and will you
turn back from Westwardho

There was a moments silence and then Drew came forward

Lower us a boat captain and lend us a caliver to make signals with
while I get my kit on deck Ill after Captain Leigh if I row him
aboard all alone to my own hands

If I ever command a ship I will not forget you said Amyas

Nor us either sir we hope for we havent forgotten you and your
honest conditions said both the other Pelicans and so away over the
side went all the five and pulled away after the admirals lantern
firing shots at intervals as signals Luckily for the five desperadoes
the night was all but calm They got on board before the morning and so
away into the boundless West

  The Raleigh the largest ship of the squadron was of only
 200 tons burden The Golden Hind Hayes ship which
 returned safe of 40 and The Squirrel whereof more
 hereafter of 10 tons In such cockboats did these old
 heroes brave the unknown seas



CHAPTER XII

HOW BIDEFORD BRIDGE DINED AT ANNERY HOUSE

 Three lords sat drinking late yestreen
 And ere they paid the lawing
 They set a combat them between
 To fight it in the dawingScotch Ballad

Every one who knows Bideford cannot but know Bideford bridge for it is
the very omphalos cynosure and soul around which the town as a body
has organized itself and as Edinburgh is Edinburgh by virtue of its
castle Rome Rome by virtue of its capitol and Egypt Egypt by virtue of
its pyramids so is Bideford Bideford by virtue of its bridge But all
do not know the occult powers which have advanced and animated the
said wondrous bridge for now five hundred years and made it the chief
wonder according to Prince and Fuller of this fair land of Devon
being first an inspired bridge a soulsaving bridge an almsgiving
bridge an educational bridge a sentient bridge and last but not
least a dinnergiving bridge All do not know how when it began to
be built some half mile higher up hands invisible carried the stones
downstream each night to the present site until Sir Richard Gurney
parson of the parish going to bed one night in sore perplexity and fear
of the evil spirit who seemed so busy in his sheepfold beheld a vision
of an angel who bade build the bridge where he himself had so kindly
transported the materials for there alone was sure foundation amid the
broad sheet of shifting sand All do not know how Bishop Grandison of
Exeter proclaimed throughout his diocese indulgences benedictions and
participation in all spiritual blessings for ever to all who would
promote the bridging of that dangerous ford and so consulting alike
the interests of their souls and of their bodies make the best of both
worlds

All do not know nor do I that though the foundation of the bridge
is laid upon wool yet it shakes at the slightest step of a horse or
that though it has twentythree arches yet one Wm Alford another
Milo carried on his back for a wager four bushels saltwater measure
all the length thereof or that the bridge is a veritable esquire
bearing arms of its own a ship and bridge proper on a plain field
and owning lands and tenements in many parishes with which the said
miraculous bridge has from time to time founded charities built
schools waged suits at law and finally for this concerns us most
given yearly dinners and kept for that purpose luxurious and liquorish
bridge that it was the best stocked cellar of wines in all Devon

To one of these dinners as it happened were invited in the year 1583
all the notabilities of Bideford and beside them Mr St Leger
of Annery close by brother of the marshal of Munster and of Lady
Grenville a most worthy and hospitable gentleman who finding riches
a snare parted with them so freely to all his neighbors as long as he
lived that he effectually prevented his children after him from falling
into the temptations thereunto incident

Between him and one of the bridge trustees arose an argument whether
a salmon caught below the bridge was better or worse than one caught
above and as that weighty question could only be decided by practical
experiment Mr St Leger vowed that as the bridge had given him a good
dinner he would give the bridge one offered a bet of five pounds that
he would find them out of the pool below Annery as firm and flaky a
salmon as the Appledore one which they had just eaten and then in the
fulness of his heart invited the whole company present to dine with him
at Annery three days after and bring with them each a wife or daughter
and Don Guzman being at table he was invited too

So there was a mighty feast in the great hall at Annery such as had
seldom been since Judge Hankford feasted Edward the Fourth there and
while every one was eating their best and drinking their worst Rose
Salterne and Don Guzman were pretending not to see each other and
watching each other all the more But Rose at least had to be very
careful of her glances for not only was her father at the table but
just opposite her sat none other than Messrs William Cary and Arthur
St Leger lieutenants in her majestys Irish army who had returned on
furlough a few days before

Rose Salterne and the Spaniard had not exchanged a word in the last six
months though they had met many times The Spaniard by no means avoided
her company except in her fathers house he only took care to obey
her carefully by seeming always unconscious of her presence beyond the
stateliest of salutes at entering and departing But he took care at
the same time to lay himself out to the very best advantage whenever
he was in her presence to be more witty more eloquent more romantic
more full of wonderful tales than he ever yet had been The cunning
Don had found himself foiled in his first tactic and he was now
trying another and a far more formidable one In the first place Rose
deserved a very severe punishment for having dared to refuse the love
of a Spanish nobleman and what greater punishment could he inflict than
withdrawing the honor of his attentions and the sunshine of his smiles
There was conceit enough in that notion but there was cunning too
for none knew better than the Spaniard that women like the world are
pretty sure to value a man especially if there be any real worth in
him at his own price and that the more he demands for himself the
more they will give for him

And now he would put a high price on himself and pique her pride as
she was too much accustomed to worship to be won by flattering it He
might have done that by paying attention to some one else but he was
too wise to employ so coarse a method which might raise indignation or
disgust or despair in Roses heart but would have never brought her to
his feetas it will never bring any woman worth bringing So he quietly
and unobtrusively showed her that he could do without her and she poor
fool as she was meant to do began forthwith to ask herselfwhy What
was the hidden treasure what was the reserve force which made him
independent of her while she could not say that she was independent of
him Had he a secret how pleasant to know it Some huge ambition how
pleasant to share in it Some mysterious knowledge how pleasant to
learn it Some capacity of love beyond the common how delicious to have
it all for her own He must be greater wiser richerhearted than she
was as well as betterborn Ah if his wealth would but supply her
poverty And so step by step she was being led to sue in forma
pauperis to the very man whom she had spurned when he sued in like form
to her That temptation of having some mysterious private treasure of
being the priestess of some hidden sanctuary and being able to thank
Heaven that she was not as other women are was becoming fast too much
for Rose as it is too much for most For none knew better than the
Spaniard how much more fond women are by the very law of their sex
of worshipping than of being worshipped and of obeying than of being
obeyed how their coyness often their scorn is but a mask to hide
their consciousness of weakness and a mask too of which they
themselves will often be the first to tire

And Rose was utterly tired of that same mask as she sat at table at
Annery that day and Don Guzman saw it in her uneasy and downcast looks
and thinking conceited coxcomb that she must be by now sufficiently
punished stole a glance at her now and then and was not abashed when
he saw that she dropped her eyes when they met his because he saw her
silence and abstraction increase and something like a blush steal into
her cheeks So he pretended to be as much downcast and abstracted as she
was and went on with his glances till he once found her poor thing
looking at him to see if he was looking at her and then he knew his
prey was safe and asked her with his eyes Do you forgive me and
saw her stop dead in her talk to her next neighbor and falter and drop
her eyes and raise them again after a minute in search of his that
he might repeat the pleasant question And then what could she do but
answer with all her face and every bend of her pretty neck And do you
forgive me in turn

Whereon Don Guzman broke out jubilant like nightingale on bough with
story and jest and repartee and became forthwith the soul of the
whole company and the most charming of all cavaliers And poor Rose
knew that she was the cause of his sudden change of mood and blamed
herself for what she had done and shuddered and blushed at her own
delight and longed that the feast was over that she might hurry home
and hide herself alone with sweet fancies about a love the reality of
which she felt she dared not face

It was a beautiful sight the great terrace at Annery that afternoon
with the smart dames in their gaudy dresses parading up and down in twos
and threes before the stately house or looking down upon the park with
the old oaks and the deer and the broad landlocked river spread out
like a lake beneath all bright in the glare of the midsummer sun or
listening obsequiously to the two great ladies who did the honors Mrs
St Leger the hostess and her sisterinlaw fair Lady Grenville All
chatted and laughed and eyed each others dresses and gossiped about
each others husbands and servants only Rose Salterne kept apart and
longed to get into a corner and laugh or cry she knew not which

Our pretty Rose seems sad said Lady Grenville coming up to her
Cheer up child we want you to come and sing to us

Rose answered she knew not what and obeyed mechanically

She took the lute and sat down on a bench beneath the house while the
rest grouped themselves round her

What shall I sing

Let us have your old song Earl Haldans Daughter

Rose shrank from it It was a loud and dashing ballad which chimed in
but little with her thoughts and Frank had praised it too in happier
days long since gone by She thought of him and of others and of her
pride and carelessness and the song seemed ominous to her and yet for
that very reason she dared not refuse to sing it for fear of suspicion
where no one suspected and so she began per force


I

It was Earl Haldans daughter She lookd across the sea She lookd
across the water And long and loud laughd she The locks of six
princesses Must be my marriagefee So hey bonny boat and ho bonny
boat Who comes a wooing me

II

It was Earl Haldans daughter She walkd along the sand When she was
aware of a knight so fair Come sailing to the land His sails were all
of velvet His mast of beaten gold And hey bonny boat and ho bonny
boat Who saileth here so bold

III

The locks of five princesses I won beyond the sea I shore their
golden tresses To fringe a cloak for thee One handful yet is wanting
But one of all the tale So hey bonny boat and ho bonny boat Furl up
thy velvet sail

IV

He leapt into the water That rover young and bold He gript Earl
Haldans daughter He shore her locks of gold Go weep go weep proud
maiden The tale is full today Now hey bonny boat and ho bonny boat
Sail Westwardho and away


As she ceased a measured voice with a foreign accent thrilled through
her

In the East they say the nightingale sings to the rose Devon more
happy has nightingale and rose in one

We have no nightingales in Devon Don Guzman said Lady Grenville
but our little forest thrushes sing as you hear sweetly enough to
content any ear But what brings you away from the gentlemen so early

These letters said he which have just been put into my hand and
as they call me home to Spain I was loath to lose a moment of that
delightful company from which I must part so soon

To Spain asked halfadozen voices for the Don was a general
favorite

Yes and thence to the Indies My ransom has arrived and with it
the promise of an office I am to be Governor of La Guayra in Caracas
Congratulate me on my promotion

A mist was over Roses eyes The Spaniards voice was hard and flippant
Did he care for her after all And if he did was it nevertheless
hopeless How her cheeks glowed Everybody must see it Anything to turn
away their attention from her and in that nervous haste which makes
people speak and speak foolishly too just because they ought to be
silent she asked

And where is La Guayra

Half round the world on the coast of the Spanish Main The loveliest
place on earth and the loveliest governors house in a forest of palms
at the foot of a mountain eight thousand feet high I shall only want a
wife there to be in paradise

I dont doubt that you may persuade some fair lady of Seville to
accompany you thither said Lady Grenville

Thanks gracious madam but the truth is that since I have had the
bliss of knowing English ladies I have begun to think that they are the
only ones on earth worth wooing

A thousand thanks for the compliment but I fear none of our free
English maidens would like to submit to the guardianship of a duenna
Eh Rose how should you like to be kept under lock and key all day by
an ugly old woman with a horn on her forehead

Poor Rose turned so scarlet that Lady Grenville knew her secret on the
spot and would have tried to turn the conversation but before she
could speak some burghers wife blundered out a commonplace about
the jealousy of Spanish husbands and another to make matters better
giggled out something more true than delicate about West Indian masters
and fair slaves

Ladies said Don Guzman reddening believe me that these are but the
calumnies of ignorance If we be more jealous than other nations it is
because we love more passionately If some of us abroad are profligate
it is because they poor men have no helpmate which like the
amethyst keeps its wearer pure I could tell you stories ladies of
the constancy and devotion of Spanish husbands even in the Indies as
strange as ever romancer invented

Can you Then we challenge you to give us one at least

I fear it would be too long madam

The longer the more pleasant senor How can we spend an hour better
this afternoon while the gentlemen within are finishing their wine

Storytelling in those old times when books and authors also lucky
for the public were rarer than now was a common amusement and as the
Spaniards accomplishments in that line were well known all the ladies
crowded round him the servants brought chairs and benches and Don
Guzman taking his seat in the midst with a proud humility at Lady
Grenvilles feet began

Your perfections fair and illustrious ladies must doubtless have
heard ere now how Sebastian Cabota some fortyfive years ago sailed
forth with a commission from my late master the Emperor Charles the
Fifth to discover the golden lands of Tarshish Ophir and Cipango but
being in want of provisions stopped short at the mouth of that mighty
South American river to which he gave the name of Rio de la Plata and
sailing up it discovered the fair land of Paraguay But you may not
have heard how on the bank of that river at the mouth of the Rio
Terceiro he built a fort which men still call Cabots Tower nor have
you perhaps heard of the strange tale which will ever make the tower a
sacred spot to all true lovers

For when he returned to Spain the year after he left in his tower a
garrison of a hundred and twenty men under the command of Nuno de Lara
Ruiz Moschera and Sebastian da Hurtado old friends and fellowsoldiers
of my invincible grandfather Don Ferdinando da Soto and with them
a jewel than which Spain never possessed one more precious Lucia
Miranda the wife of Hurtado who famed in the court of the emperor
no less for her wisdom and modesty than for her unrivalled beauty
had thrown up all the pomp and ambition of a palace to marry a poor
adventurer and to encounter with him the hardships of a voyage round
the world Mangora the cacique of the neighboring Timbuez Indians with
whom Lara had contrived to establish a friendship cast his eyes on
this fair creature and no sooner saw than he coveted no sooner coveted
than he plotted with the devilish subtilty of a savage to seize by
force what he knew he could never gain by right She soon found out his
passion she was wise enoughwhat every woman is notto know when she
is loved and telling her husband kept as much as she could out of her
new lovers sight while the savage pressed Hurtado to come and visit
him and to bring his lady with him Hurtado suspecting the snare and
yet fearing to offend the cacique excused himself courteously on
the score of his soldiers duty and the savage mad with desire and
disappointment began plotting against Hurtados life

So went on several weeks till food grew scarce and Don Hurtado and
Don Ruiz Moschera with fifty soldiers were sent up the river on a
foraging party Mangora saw his opportunity and leapt at it forthwith

The tower ladies as I have heard from those who have seen it stands
on a knoll at the meeting of the two rivers while on the land side
stretches a dreary marsh covered with tall grass and bushes a fit
place for the ambuscade of four thousand Indians which Mangora with
devilish cunning placed around the tower while he himself went boldly
up to it followed by thirty men laden with grain fruit game and all
the delicacies which his forests could afford

There with a smiling face he told the unsuspecting Lara his sorrow
for the Spaniards want of food besought him to accept the provision he
had brought and was as he had expected invited by Lara to come in and
taste the wines of Spain

In went he and his thirty fellowbandits and the feast continued
with songs and libations far into the night while Mangora often looked
round and at last boldly asked for the fair Miranda but she had shut
herself into her lodging pleading illness

A plea fair ladies which little availed that hapless dame for no
sooner had the Spaniards retired to rest leaving by I know not what
madness Mangora and his Indians within than they were awakened by the
cry of fire the explosion of their magazine and the inward rush of the
four thousand from the marsh outside

Why pain your gentle ears with details of slaughter A few fearful
minutes sufficed to exterminate my bewildered and unarmed countrymen to
bind the only survivors Miranda innocent cause of the whole tragedy
and four other women with their infants and to lead them away in
triumph across the forest towards the Indian town

Stunned by the suddenness of the evils which had passed and still
more by the thought of those worse which were to come as she too
well foresaw Miranda travelled all night through the forest and was
brought in triumph at daydawn before the Indian king to receive her
doom Judge of her astonishment when on looking up she saw that he
was not Mangora

A ray of hope flashed across her and she asked where he was

He was slain last night said the king and I his brother Siripa
am now cacique of the Timbuez

It was true Lara maddened with drink rage and wounds had caught up
his sword rushed into the thick of the fight singled out the traitor
and slain him on the spot and then forgetting safety in revenge had
continued to plunge his sword into the corpse heedless of the blows of
the savages till he fell pierced with a hundred wounds

A ray of hope as I said flashed across the wretched Miranda for a
moment but the next she found that she had been freed from one bandit
only to be delivered to another

Yes said the new king in broken Spanish my brother played a bold
stake and lost it but it was well worth the risk and he showed his
wisdom thereby You cannot be his queen now you must content yourself
with being mine

Miranda desperate answered him with every fierce taunt which she
could invent against his treachery and his crime and asked him how he
came to dream that the wife of a Christian Spaniard would condescend
to become the mistress of a heathen savage hoping unhappy lady to
exasperate him into killing her on the spot But in vain she only
prolonged thereby her own misery For whether it was ladies that the
novel sight of divine virtue and beauty awed as it may have awed me ere
now where it had just before maddened or whether some dream crossed
the savage as it may have crossed me ere now that he could make the
wisdom of a mortal angel help his ambition as well as her beauty his
happiness or whether which I will never believe of one of those dark
children of the devil though I can boldly assert it of myself some
spark of boldness within him made him too proud to take by force what
he could not win by persuasion certain it is as the Indians themselves
confessed afterwards that the savage only answered her by smiles and
bidding his men unbind her told her that she was no slave of his and
that it only lay with her to become the sovereign of him and all
his vassals assigned her a hut to herself loaded her with savage
ornaments and for several weeks treated her with no less courtesy
so miraculous is the power of love than if he had been a cavalier of
Castile

Three months and more ladies as I have heard passed in this misery
and every day Miranda grew more desperate of all deliverance and saw
staring her in the face nearer and nearer some hideous and shameful
end when one day going down with the wives of the cacique to draw water
in the river she saw on the opposite bank a white man in a tattered
Spanish dress with a drawn sword in his hand who had no sooner espied
her than shrieking her name he plunged into the stream swam across
landed at her feet and clasped her in his arms It was no other
ladies incredible as it may seem than Don Sebastian himself who had
returned with Ruiz Moschera to the tower and found it only a charred
and bloodstained heap of ruins

He guessed as by inspiration what had passed and whither his lady
was gone and without a thought of danger like a true Spanish gentleman
and a true Spanish lover darted off alone into the forest and
guided only by the inspiration of his own loyal heart found again his
treasure and found it still unstained and his own

Who can describe the joy and who again the terror of their meeting
The Indian women had fled in fear and for the short ten minutes that
the lovers were left together life to be sure was one long kiss
But what to do they knew not To go inland was to rush into the enemys
arms He would have swum with her across the river and attempted it
but his strength worn out with hunger and travel failed him he drew
her with difficulty on shore again and sat down by her to await their
doom with prayer the first and last resource of virtuous ladies as
weapons are of cavaliers

Alas for them May no true lovers ever have to weep over joys so soon
lost after having been so hardly found For ere a quarter of an hour
was passed the Indian women who had fled at his approach returned
with all the warriors of the tribe Don Sebastian desperate would
fain have slain his wife and himself on the spot but his hand sank
againand whose would not but an Indiansas he raised it against
that fair and faithful breast in a few minutes he was surrounded
seized from behind disarmed and carried in triumph into the village
And if you cannot feel for him in that misery fair ladies who have
known no sorrow yet I a prisoner can

Don Guzman paused a moment as if overcome by emotion and I will not
say that as he paused he did not look to see if Rose Salternes eyes
were on him as indeed they were

Yes I can feel with him I can estimate better than you ladies the
greatness of that love which could submit to captivity to the loss of
his sword to the loss of that honor which next to god and his mother
is the true Spaniards deity There are those who have suffered that
shame at the hands of valiant gentlemen and again Don Guzman looked
up at Rose and yet would have sooner died a thousand deaths but he
dared to endure it from the hands of villains savages heathens for he
was a true Spaniard and therefore a true lover but I will go on with
my tale

This wretched pair then as I have been told by Ruiz Moschera himself
stood together before the cacique He like a true child of the devil
comprehending in a moment who Don Sebastian was laughed with delight at
seeing his rival in his power and bade bind him at once to a tree and
shoot him to death with arrows

But the poor Miranda sprang forward and threw herself at his feet and
with piteous entreaties besought for mercy from him who knew no mercy

And yet love and the sight of her beauty and the terrible eloquence of
her words while she invoked on his head the just vengeance of Heaven
wrought even on his heart nevertheless the pleasure of seeing her who
had so long scorned him a suppliant at his feet was too delicate to
be speedily foregone and not till she was all but blind with tears
and dumb with agony of pleading did he make answer that if she would
consent to become his wife her husbands life should be spared She in
her haste and madness sobbed out desperately I know not what consent
Don Sebastian who understood if not the language still the meaning
so had love quickened his understanding shrieked to her not to lose
her precious soul for the sake of his worthless body that death was
nothing compared to the horror of that shame and such other words as
became a noble and valiant gentleman She shuddering now at her own
frailty would have recalled her promise but Siripa kept her to it
vowing if she disappointed him again such a death to her husband as
made her blood run cold to hear of and the wretched woman could only
escape for the present by some story that it was not the custom of her
race to celebrate nuptials till a month after the betrothment that the
anger of Heaven would be on her unless she first performed in solitude
certain religious rites and lastly that if he dared to lay hands
on her husband she would die so resolutely that every drop of water
should be deep enough to drown her every thorn sharp enough to stab
her to the heart till fearing lest by demanding too much he should lose
all and awed too as he had been at first by a voice and looks which
seemed to be in comparison with his own divine Siripa bade her go
back to her hut promising her husband life but promising too that
if he ever found the two speaking together even for a moment he would
pour out on them both all the cruelty of those tortures in which the
devil their father has so perfectly instructed the Indians

So Don Sebastian being stripped of his garments and painted after
the Indian fashion was set to all mean and toilsome work amid the
buffetings and insults of the whole village And this ladies he
endured without a murmur ay took delight in enduring it as he would
have endured things worse a thousand times only for the sake like a
true lover as he was of being near the goddess whom he worshipped and
of seeing her now and then afar off happy enough to be repaid even by
that for all indignities

And yet you who have loved may well guess as I can that ere a week
had passed Don Sebastian and the Lady Miranda had found means in spite
of all spiteful eyes to speak to each other once and again and to
assure each other of their love even to talk of escape before the
months grace should be expired And Miranda whose heart was full of
courage as long as she felt her husband near her went so far as to plan
a means of escape which seemed possible and hopeful

For the youngest wife of the cacique who till Mirandas coming
had been his favorite often talked with the captive insulting and
tormenting her in her spite and jealousy and receiving in return only
gentle and conciliatory words And one day when the woman had been
threatening to kill her Miranda took courage to say Do you fancy that
I shall not be as glad to be rid of your husband as you to be rid of
me Why kill me needlessly when all that you require is to get me forth
of the place Out of sight out of mind When I am gone your husband
will soon forget me and you will be his favorite as before Soon
seeing that the girl was inclined to listen she went on to tell her
of her love to Don Sebastian entreating and adjuring her by the love
which she bore the cacique to pity and help her and so won upon the
girl that she consented to be privy to Mirandas escape and even
offered to give her an opportunity of speaking to her husband about it
and at last was so won over by Miranda that she consented to keep all
intruders out of the way while Don Sebastian that very night visited
Miranda in her hut

The hapless husband thirsting for his love was in that hut be sure
the moment that kind darkness covered his stepsand what cheer these
two made of each other when they once found themselves together
lovers must fancy for themselves but so it was that after many a
leavetaking there was no departure and when the night was wellnigh
past Sebastian and Miranda were still talking together as if they had
never met before and would never meet again

But it befell ladies would that I was not speaking truth but
inventing that I might have invented something merrier for your ears
it befell that very night that the young wife of the cacique whose
heart was lifted up with the thought that her rival was now at last
disposed of tried all her wiles to win back her faithless husband
but in vain He only answered her caresses by indifference then by
contempt then insults then blows for with the Indians woman is
always a slave or rather a beast of burden and went on to draw such
cruel comparisons between her dark skin and the glorious fairness of the
Spanish lady that the wretched girl beside herself with rage burst
out at last with her own secret Fool that you are to madden yourself
about a stranger who prizes one hair of her Spanish husbands head more
than your whole body Much does your new bride care for you She is at
this moment in her husbands arms

The cacique screamed furiously to know what she meant and she her
jealousy and hate of the guiltless lady boiling over once for all bade
him if he doubted her go see for himself

What use of many words They were taken Love or rather lust
repelled turned in a moment into devilish hate and the cacique
summoning his Indians bade them bind the wretched Don Sebastian to a
tree and there inflicted on him the lingering death to which he had at
first been doomed For Miranda he had more exquisite cruelty in store
And shall I tell it Yes ladies for the honor of love and of Spain
and for a justification of those cruelties against the Indians which are
so falsely imputed to our most Christian nation it shall be told he
delivered the wretched lady over to the tender mercies of his wives and
what they were is neither fit for me to tell nor you to hear

The two wretched lovers cast themselves upon each others neck drank
each others salt tears with the last kisses accused themselves as
the cause of each others death and then rising above fear and grief
broke out into triumph at thus dying for and with each other and
proclaiming themselves the martyrs of love commended their souls to
God and then stepped joyfully and proudly to their doom

And what was that asked halfadozen trembling voices

Don Sebastian as I have said was shot to death with arrows but as
for the Lady Miranda the wretches themselves confessed afterwards when
they received due vengeance for their crimes as they did receive it
that after all shameful and horrible indignities she was bound to
a tree and there burned slowly in her husbands sight stifling her
shrieks lest they should wring his heart by one additional pang and
never taking her eyes to the last off that beloved face And so died
but not unavenged Sebastian de Hurtado and Lucia Mirandaa Spanish
husband and a Spanish wife

The Don paused and the ladies were silent awhile for indeed there
was many a gentle tear to be dried but at last Mrs St Leger spoke
half it seemed to turn off the too painful impression of the overtrue
tale the outlines whereof may be still read in old Charlevoix

You have told a sad and a noble tale sir and told it well but
though your story was to set forth a perfect husband it has ended
rather by setting forth a perfect wife

And if I have forgotten madam in praising her to praise him also
have I not done that which would have best pleased his heroical and
chivalrous spirit He be sure would have forgotten his own virtue in
the light of hers and he would have wished me I doubt not to do the
same also And beside madam where ladies are the theme who has time
or heart to cast one thought upon their slaves And the Don made one of
his deliberate and highlyfinished bows

Don Guzman is courtier enough as far as compliments go said one of
the young ladies but it was hardly courtierlike of him to find us so
sad an entertainment upon a merry evening

Yes said another we must ask him for no more stories

Or songs either said a third I fear he knows none but about
forsaken maidens and despairing lovers

I know nothing at all about forsaken ladies madam because ladies are
never forsaken in Spain

Nor about lovers despairing there I suppose

That good opinion of ourselves madam with which you English are
pleased to twit us now and then always prevents so sad a state of mind
For myself I have had little to do with love but I have had still less
to do with despair and intend by help of Heaven to have less

You are valiant sir

You would not have me a coward madam and so forth

Now all this time Don Guzman had been talking at Rose Salterne and
giving her the very slightest hint every now and then that he was
talking at her till the poor girls face was almost crimson with
pleasure and she gave herself up to the spell He loved her still
perhaps he knew that she loved him he must know some day She felt now
that there was no escape she was almost glad to think that there was
none

The dark handsome stately face the melodious voice with its rich
Spanish accent the quiet grace of the gestures the wild pathos of
the story even the measured and inflated style as of one speaking of
another and a loftier world the chivalrous respect and admiration for
woman and for faithfulness to womanwhat a man he was If he had been
pleasant heretofore he was now enchanting All the ladies round felt
that she could see as much as she herself did no not quite as much
she hoped She surely understood him and felt for his loneliness more
than any of them Had she not been feeling for it through long and sad
months But it was she whom he was thinking of she whom he was speaking
to all along Oh why had the tale ended so soon She would gladly have
sat and wept her eyes out till midnight over one melodious misery after
another but she was quite wise enough to keep her secret to herself
and sat behind the rest with greedy eyes and demure lips full of
strange and new happinessor misery she knew not which to call it

In the meanwhile as it was ordained Cary could see and hear through
the window of the hall a good deal of what was going on

How that Spanish crocodile ogles the Rose whispered he to young St
Leger

What wonder He is not the first by many a one

AybutBy heaven she is making sideshots at him with those
languishing eyes of hers the little baggage

What wonder He is not the first say I and wont be the last Pass
the wine man

I have had enough between sack and singing my head is as mazed as a
dizzy sheep Let me slip out

Not yet man remember you are bound for one song more

So Cary against his will sat and sang another song and in the
meanwhile the party had broken up and wandered away by twos and threes
among trim gardens and pleasaunces and clipped yewwalks

 Where westwinds with musky wing
 About the cedarn alleys fling
 Nard and cassias balmy smells

admiring the beauty of that stately place long since passed into other
hands and fallen to decay but then if old Prince speaks true one of
the noblest mansions of the West

At last Cary got away and out sober but just enough flushed with wine
to be ready for any quarrel and luckily for him had not gone twenty
yards along the great terrace before he met Lady Grenville

Has your ladyship seen Don Guzman

Yeswhy where is he He was with me not ten minutes ago You know he
is going back to Spain

Going Has his ransom come

Yes and with it a governorship in the Indies

Governorship Much good may it do the governed

Why not then He is surely a most gallant gentleman

Gallant enoughyes said Cary carelessly I must find him and
congratulate him on his honors

I will help you to find him said Lady Grenville whose womans eye
and ear had already suspected something Escort me sir

It is but too great an honor to squire the Queen of Bideford said
Cary offering his hand

If I am your queen sir I must be obeyed answered she in a meaning
tone Cary took the hint and went on chattering cheerfully enough

But Don Guzman was not to be found in garden or in pleasaunce

Perhaps at last said a burghers wife with a toss of her head your
ladyship may meet with him at Hankfords oak

At Hankfords oak what should take him there

Pleasant company I reckon with another toss I heard him and
Mistress Salterne talking about the oak just now

Cary turned pale and drew in his breath

Very likely said Lady Grenville quietly Will you walk with me so
far Mr Cary

To the worlds end if your ladyship condescends so far And off they
went Lady Grenville wishing that they were going anywhere else but
afraid to let Cary go alone and suspecting too that some one or other
ought to go

So they went down past the herds of deer by a trimkept path into
the lonely dell where stood the fatal oak and as they went Lady
Grenville to avoid more unpleasant talk poured into Carys unheeding
ears the story which he probably had heard fifty times before how old
Chiefjustice Hankford whom some contradictory myths make the man who
committed Prince Henry to prison for striking him on the bench weary
of life and sickened at the horrors and desolations of the Wars of the
Roses went down to his house at Annery there and bade his keeper shoot
any man who passing through the deerpark at night should refuse to
stand when challenged and then going down into that glen himself and
hiding himself beneath that oak met willingly by his keepers hand the
death which his own dared not inflict but ere the story was half done
Cary grasped Lady Grenvilles hand so tightly that she gave a little
shriek of pain

There they are whispered he heedless of her and pointed to the oak
where half hidden by the tall fern stood Rose and the Spaniard

Her head was on his bosom She seemed sobbing trembling he talking
earnestly and passionately but Lady Grenvilles little shriek made them
both look up To turn and try to escape was to confess all and the
two collecting themselves instantly walked towards her Rose wishing
herself fathoms deep beneath the earth

Mind sir whispered Lady Grenville as they came up you have seen
nothing

Madam

If you are not on my ground you are on my brothers Obey me

Cary bit his lip and bowed courteously to the Don

I have to congratulate you I hear senor on your approaching
departure

I kiss your hands senor in return but I question whether it be a
matter of congratulation considering all that I leave behind

So do I answered Cary bluntly enough and the four walked back to
the house Lady Grenville taking everything for granted with the most
charming good humor and chatting to her three silent companions
till they gained the terrace once more and found four or five of
the gentlemen with Sir Richard at their head proceeding to the
bowlinggreen

Lady Grenville in an agony of fear about the quarrel which she knew
must come would have gladly whispered five words to her husband but
she dared not do it before the Spaniard and dreaded too a faint or
a scream from the Rose whose father was of the party So she walked
on with her fair prisoner commanding Cary to escort them in and the
Spaniard to go to the bowlinggreen

Cary obeyed but he gave her the slip the moment she was inside the
door and then darted off to the gentlemen

His heart was on fire all his old passion for the Rose had flashed up
again at the sight of her with a loverand that lover a Spaniard He
would cut his throat for him if steel could do it Only he recollected
that Salterne was there and shrank from exposing Rose and shrank too
as every gentleman should from making a public quarrel in another mans
house Never mind Where there was a will there was a way He could get
him into a corner and quarrel with him privately about the cut of
his beard or the color of his ribbon So in he went and luckily or
unluckily found standing together apart from the rest Sir Richard the
Don and young St Leger

Well Don Guzman you have given us winebibbers the slip this
afternoon I hope you have been well employed in the meanwhile

Delightfully to myself senor said the Don who enraged at being
interrupted if not discovered was as ready to fight as Cary but
disliked of course an explosion as much as he did and to others I
doubt not

So the ladies say quoth St Leger He has been making them all cry
with one of his stories and robbing us meanwhile of the pleasure we had
hoped for from some of his Spanish songs

The devil take Spanish songs said Cary in a low voice but loud
enough for the Spaniard Don Guzman clapt his hand on his swordhilt
instantly

Lieutenant Cary said Sir Richard in a stern voice the wine has
surely made you forget yourself

As sober as yourself most worshipful knight but if you want a Spanish
song heres one and a very scurvy one it is like its subject

 Don Desperado
 Walked on the Prado
 And there he met his enemy
 He pulled out a knife a
 And let out his life a
 And fled for his own across the sea

And he bowed low to the Spaniard

The insult was too gross to require any spluttering

Senor Cary we meet

I thank your quick apprehension Don Guzman Maria Magdalena Sotomayor
de Soto When where and with what weapons

For Gods sake gentlemen Nephew Arthur Cary is your guest do you
know the meaning of this

St Leger was silent Cary answered for him

An old Irish quarrel I assure you sir A matter of years standing
In unlacing the senors helmet the evening that he was taken prisoner
I was unlucky enough to twitch his mustachios You recollect the fact
of course senor

Perfectly said the Spaniard and then halfamused and halfpleased
in spite of his bitter wrath at Carys quickness and delicacy in
shielding Rose he bowed and

And it gives me much pleasure to find that he whom I trust to have the
pleasure of killing tomorrow morning is a gentleman whose nice sense of
honor renders him thoroughly worthy of the sword of a De Soto

Cary bowed in return while Sir Richard who saw plainly enough that the
excuse was feigned shrugged his shoulders

What weapons senor asked Will again

I should have preferred a horse and pistols said Don Guzman after
a moment half to himself and in Spanish they make surer work of it
than bodkins but with a sigh and one of his smiles beggars must not
be choosers

The best horse in my stable is at your service senor said Sir
Richard Grenville instantly

And in mine also senor said Cary and I shall be happy to allow you
a week to train him if he does not answer at first to a Spanish hand

You forget in your courtesy gentle sir that the insult being with me
the time lies with me also We wipe it off tomorrow morning with simple
rapiers and daggers Who is your second

Mr Arthur St Leger here senor who is yours

The Spaniard felt himself alone in the world for one moment and then
answered with another of his smiles

Your nation possesses the soul of honor He who fights an Englishman
needs no second

And he who fights among Englishmen will always find one said Sir
Richard I am the fittest second for my guest

You only add one more obligation illustrious cavalier to a twoyears
prodigality of favors which I shall never be able to repay

But Nephew Arthur said Grenville you cannot surely be second
against your fathers guest and your own uncle

I cannot help it sir I am bound by an oath as Will can tell you I
suppose you wont think it necessary to let me blood

You half deserve it sirrah said Sir Richard who was very angry but
the Don interposed quickly

Heaven forbid senors We are no French duellists who are mad enough
to make four or six lives answer for the sins of two This gentleman
and I have quarrel enough between us I suspect to make a right bloody
encounter

The dependence is good enough sir said Cary licking his sinful
lips at the thought Very well Rapiers and shirts at three tomorrow
morningIs that the bill of fare Ask Sir Richard where Atty It is
against punctilio now for me to speak to him till after I am killed

On the sands opposite The tide will be out at three And now gallant
gentlemen let us join the bowlers

And so they went back and spent a merry evening all except poor Rose
who ere she went back had poured all her sorrows into Lady Grenvilles
ear For the kind woman knowing that she was motherless and guileless
carried her off into Mrs St Legers chamber and there entreated her
to tell the truth and heaped her with pity but with no comfort For
indeed what comfort was there to give

     

Three oclock upon a still pure bright midsummer morning A broad
and yellow sheet of ribbed tidesands through which the shallow river
wanders from one hillfoot to the other whispering round dark knolls
of rock and under low treefringed cliffs and banks of golden broom
A mile below the long bridge and the white walled town all sleeping
pearly in the soft haze beneath a cloudless vault of blue The
white glare of dawn which last night hung high in the northwest has
travelled now to the northeast and above the wooded wall of the hills
the sky is flushing with rose and amber

A long line of gulls goes wailing up inland the rooks from Annery come
cawing and sporting round the corner at Landcross while high above them
four or five herons flap solemnly along to find their breakfast on the
shallows The pheasants and partridges are clucking merrily in the long
wet grass every copse and hedgerow rings with the voice of birds but
the lark who has been singing since midnight in the blank height of
the dark suddenly hushes his carol and drops headlong among the corn
as a broadwinged buzzard swings from some wooded peak into the abyss of
the valley and hangs highpoised above the heavenward songster The air
is full of perfume sweet clover newmown hay the fragrant breath of
kine the dainty scent of seaweed wreaths and fresh wet sand Glorious
day glorious place bridal of earth and sky decked well with bridal
garlands bridal perfumes bridal songsWhat do those four cloaked
figures there by the river brink a dark spot on the fair face of the
summer morn

Yet one is as cheerful as if he too like all nature round him were
going to a wedding and that is Will Cary He has been bathing down
below to cool his brain and steady his hand and he intends to stop Don
Guzman Maria Magdalena Sotomayor de Sotos wooing for ever and a day
The Spaniard is in a very different mood fierce and haggard he is
pacing up and down the sand He intends to kill Will Cary but then
Will he be the nearer to Rose by doing so Can he stay in Bideford
Will she go with him Shall he stoop to stain his family by marrying a
burghers daughter It is a confused all but desperate business and
Don Guzman is certain but of one thing that he is madly in love with
this fair witch and that if she refuse him then rather than see her
accept another man he would kill her with his own hands

Sir Richard Grenville too is in no very pleasant humor as St Leger
soon discovers when the two seconds begin whispering over their
arrangements

We cannot have either of them killed Arthur

Mr Cary swears he will kill the Spaniard sir

He shant The Spaniard is my guest I am answerable for him to Leigh
and for his ransom too And how can Leigh accept the ransom if the man
is not given up safe and sound They wont pay for a dead carcass boy
The mans life is worth two hundred pounds

A very bad bargain sir for those who pay the said two hundred for
the rascal but what if he kills Cary

Worse still Cary must not be killed I am very angry with him but he
is too good a lad to be lost and his father would never forgive us We
must strike up their swords at the first scratch

It will make them very mad sir

Hang them let them fight us then if they dont like our counsel It
must be Arthur

Be sure sir said Arthur that whatsoever you shall command I shall
perform It is only too great an honor to a young man as I am to find
myself in the same duel with your worship and to have the advantage of
your wisdom and experience

Sir Richard smiles and saysNow gentlemen are you ready

The Spaniard pulls out a little crucifix and kisses it devoutly
smiting on his breast crosses himself two or three times and
saysMost willingly senor

Cary kisses no crucifix but says a prayer nevertheless

Cloaks and doublets are tossed off the men placed the rapiers measured
hilt and point Sir Richard and St Leger place themselves right and
left of the combatants facing each other the points of their drawn
swords on the sand Cary and the Spaniard stand for a moment quite
upright their swordarms stretched straight before them holding the
long rapier horizontally the left hand clutching the dagger close to
their breasts So they stand eye to eye with clenched teeth and pale
crushed lips while men might count a score St Leger can hear the
beating of his own heart Sir Richard is praying inwardly that no life
may be lost Suddenly there is a quick turn of Carys wrist and a leap
forward The Spaniards dagger flashes and the rapier is turned aside
Cary springs six feet back as the Spaniard rushes on him in turn Parry
thrust parrythe steel rattles the sparks fly the men breathe fierce
and loud the devils game is begun in earnest

Five minutes have the two had instant death a short six inches off from
those wild sinful hearts of theirs and not a scratch has been given
Yes the Spaniards rapier passes under Carys left arm he bleeds

A hit a hit Strike up Atty and the swords are struck up instantly

Cary nettled by the smart tries to close with his foe but the seconds
cross their swords before him

It is enough gentlemen Don Guzmans honor is satisfied

But not my revenge senor says the Spaniard with a frown This duel
is a loutrance on my part and I believe on Mr Carys also

By heaven it is says Will trying to push past Let me go Arthur
St Leger one of us must down Let me go I say

If you stir Mr Cary you have to do with Richard Grenville thunders
the lion voice I am angry enough with you for having brought on this
duel at all Dont provoke me still further young hothead

Cary stops sulkily

You do not know all Sir Richard or you would not speak in this way

I do sir all and I shall have the honor of talking it over with Don
Guzman myself

Hey said the Spaniard You came here as my second Sir Richard as I
understood but not as my counsellor

Arthur take your man away Cary obey me as you would your father
sir Can you not trust Richard Grenville

Come away for Gods sake says poor Arthur dragging Carys sword
from him Sir Richard must know best

So Cary is led off sulking and Sir Richard turns to the Spaniard

And now Don Guzman allow me though much against my will to speak to
you as a friend to a friend You will pardon me if I say that I cannot
but have seen last nights devotion to

You will be pleased senor not to mention the name of any lady to whom
I may have shown devotion I am not accustomed to have my little affairs
talked over by any unbidden counsellors

Well senor if you take offence you take that which is not given
Only I warn you with all apologies for any seeming forwardness that
the quest on which you seem to be is one on which you will not be
allowed to proceed

And who will stop me asked the Spaniard with a fierce oath

You are not aware illustrious senor said Sir Richard parrying the
question that our English laity look upon mixed marriages with full as
much dislike as your own ecclesiastics

Marriage sir Who gave you leave to mention that word to me

Sir Richards brow darkened the Spaniard in his insane pride had
forced upon the good knight a suspicion which was not really just

Is it possible then Senor Don Guzman that I am to have the shame of
mentioning a baser word

Mention what you will sir All words are the same to me for just or
unjust I shall answer them alike only by my sword

You will do no such thing sir You forget that I am your host

And do you suppose that you have therefore a right to insult me Stand
on your guard sir

Grenville answered by slapping his own rapier home into the sheath with
a quiet smile

Senor Don Guzman must be well enough aware of who Richard Grenville is
to know that he may claim the right of refusing duel to any man if he
shall so think fit

Sir cried the Spaniard with an oath this is too much Do you dare
to hint that I am unworthy of your sword Know insolent Englishman I
am not merely a De Soto though that by St James were enough for you
or any man I am a Sotomayor a Mendoza a Bovadilla a Losada asir
I have blood royal in my veins and you dare to refuse my challenge

Richard Grenville can show quarterings probably against even Don
Guzman Maria Magdalena Sotomayor de Soto or against with no offence to
the unquestioned nobility of your pedigree the bluest blood of Spain
But he can show moreover thank God a reputation which raises him
as much above the imputation of cowardice as it does above that of
discourtesy If you think fit senor to forget what you have just in
very excusable anger vented and to return with me you will find me
still as ever your most faithful servant and host If otherwise you
have only to name whither you wish your mails to be sent and I shall
with unfeigned sorrow obey your commands concerning them

The Spaniard bowed stiffly answered To the nearest tavern senor
and then strode away His baggage was sent thither He took a boat down
to Appledore that very afternoon and vanished none knew whither A
very courteous note to Lady Grenville enclosing the jewel which he had
been used to wear round his neck was the only memorial he left behind
him except indeed the scar on Carys arm and poor Roses broken
heart

Now county towns are scandalous places at best and though all parties
tried to keep the duel secret yet of course before noon all Bideford
knew what had happened and a great deal more and what was even worse
Rose in an agony of terror had seen Sir Richard Grenville enter her
fathers private room and sit there closeted with him for an hour and
more and when he went upstairs came old Salterne with his stick in
his hand and after rating her soundly for far worse than a flirt gave
her I am sorry to have to say it but such was the mild fashion of
paternal rule in those times even over such daughters as Lady Jane
Grey if Roger Ascham is to be believed such a beating that her poor
sides were black and blue for many a day and then putting her on a
pillion behind him carried her off twenty miles to her old prison at
Stow mill commanding her aunt to tame down her saucy blood with bread
of affliction and water of affliction Which commands were willingly
enough fulfilled by the old dame who had always borne a grudge against
Rose for being rich while she was poor and pretty while her daughter
was plain so that between flouts and sneers and watchings and pretty
open hints that she was a disgrace to her family and no better than she
should be the poor innocent child watered her couch with her tears for
a fortnight or more stretching out her hands to the wide Atlantic and
calling wildly to Don Guzman to return and take her where he would and
she would live for him and die for him and perhaps she did not call in
vain



CHAPTER XIII

HOW THE GOLDEN HIND CAME HOME AGAIN

 The spirits of your fathers
 Shall start from every wave
 For the deck it was their field of fame
 And ocean was their grave

 CAMPBELL

So you see my dear Mrs Hawkins having the silver as your own eyes
show you beside the ores of lead manganese and copper and above all
this gossan as the Cornish call it which I suspect to be not merely
the matrix of the ore but also the very crude form and materia prima
of all metalsyou mark meIf my recipes which I had from Doctor Dee
succeed only half so well as I expect then I refine out the luna the
silver lay it by and transmute the remaining ores into sol gold
Whereupon Peru and Mexico become superfluities and England the mistress
of the globe Strange no doubt distant no doubt but possible my
dear madam possible

And what good to you if it be Mr Gilbert If you could find a
philosophers stone to turn sinners into saints nowbut naught save
Gods grace can do that and that last seems ofttimes over long in
coming And Mrs Hawkins sighed

But indeed my dear madam conceive nowThe Comb Martin mine thus
becomes a gold mine perhaps inexhaustible yields me wherewithal to
carry out my NorthWest patent meanwhile my brother Humphrey holds
Newfoundland and builds me fresh ships year by year for the forests of
pine are boundless for my China voyage

Sir Humphrey has better thoughts in his dear heart than gold Mr
Adrian a very close and gracious walker he has been this seven year I
wish my Captain John were so too

And how do you know I have naught better in my minds eye than gold
Or indeed what better could I have Is not gold the Spaniards
strengththe very mainspring of Antichrist By gold only therefore
can we outwrestle him You shake your head but say dear madam for
gold England must have which is better to make gold bloodlessly at
home or take it bloodily abroad

Oh Mr Gilbert Mr Gilbert is it not written that those who make
haste to be rich pierce themselves through with many sorrows Oh Mr
Gilbert Gods blessing is not on it all

Not on you madam Be sure that brave Captain John Hawkinss star
told me a different tale when I cast his nativity for himBorn under
stormy planets truly but under right royal and fortunate ones

Ah Mr Adrian I am a simple body and you a great philosopher but
I hold there is no star for the seaman like the Star of Bethlehem and
that goes with peace on earth and good will to men and not with such
arms as that Mr Adrian I cant abide to look upon them

And she pointed up to one of the bosses of the ribbed oakroof on which
was emblazoned the fatal crest which Clarencieux Hervey had granted
years before to her husband the DemiMoor proper bound

Ah Mr Gilbert since first he went to Guinea after those poor
negroes little lightness has my heart known and the very day that that
crest was put up in our grand new house as the parson read the first
lesson there was this text in it Mr Gilbert Woe to him that
buildeth his house by iniquity and his chambers by wrong Shalt thou
live because thou closest thyself in cedar And it went into my ears
like fire Mr Gilbert and into my heart like lead and when the parson
went on Did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice
Then it was well with him I thought of good old Captain Will andI
tell you Mr Gilbert those negroes are on my soul from morning until
night We are all mighty grand now and money comes in fast but the
Lord will require the blood of them at our hands yet He will

My dearest madam who can prosper more than you If your husband copied
the Dons too closely once or twice in the matter of those negroes which
I do not deny was he not punished at once when he lost ships men all
but life at St Juan dUlloa

Ay yes she said and that did give me a bit of comfort especially
when the queenGod save her tender heartwas so sharp with him for
pity of the poor wretches but it has not mended him He is growing fast
like the rest now Mr Gilbert greedy to win and niggardly to spend
God forgive him and always fretting and plotting for some new gain
and envying and grudging at Drake and all who are deeper in the
snare of prosperity than he is Gold gold nothing but gold in
every mouththere it is Ah I mind when Plymouth was a quiet little
Godfearing place as God could smile upon but ever since my John and
Sir Francis and poor Mr Oxenham found out the way to the Indies its
been a sad place Not a sailors wife but is crying Give give like
the daughters of the horseleech and every woman must drive her
husband out across seas to bring her home money to squander on hoods and
farthingales and go mincing with outstretched necks and wanton eyes
and they will soon learn to do worse than that for the sake of gain
But the Lords hand will be against their tires and crispingpins their
mufflers and farthingales as it was against the Jews of old Ah dear
me

The two interlocutors in this dialogue were sitting in a low
oakpanelled room in Plymouth town handsomely enough furnished adorned
with carving and gilding and coats of arms and noteworthy for many
strange knickknacks Spanish gold and silver vessels on the sideboard
strange birds and skins and charts and rough drawings of coast which
hung about the room while over the fireplace above the portrait of old
Captain Will Hawkins pet of Henry the Eighth hung the Spanish ensign
which Captain John had taken in fair fight at Rio de la Hacha fifteen
years before when with two hundred men he seized the town in despite
of ten hundred Spanish soldiers and watered his ship triumphantly at
the enemys wells

The gentleman was a tall fair man with a broad and lofty forehead
wrinkled with study and eyes weakened by long poring over the crucible
and the furnace

The lady had once been comely enough but she was aged and worn as
sailors wives are apt to be by many sorrows Many a sad day had she
had already for although John Hawkins portadmiral of Plymouth and
patriarch of British shipbuilders was a faithful husband enough and
as ready to forgive as he was to quarrel yet he was obstinate and
ruthless and in spite of his religiosity for all men were religious
then was by no means a consistent walker

And sadder days were in store for her poor soul Nine years hence she
would be asked to name her sons brave new ship and would christen it
The Repentance giving no reason in her quiet steadfast way so says
her son Sir Richard but that Repentance was the best ship in which
we could sail to the harbor of heaven and she would hear that Queen
Elizabeth complaining of the name for an unlucky one had rechristened
her The Dainty not without some byquip perhaps at the character
of her most dainty captain Richard Hawkins the complete seaman and
Euphuist afloat of whom perhaps more hereafter

With sad eyes Mrs then Lady Hawkins would see that gallant bark sail
Westwardho to go the world around as many another ship sailed and
then wait as many a mother beside had waited for the sail which never
returned till dim and uncertain came tidings of her boy fighting for
four days three great Armadas for the coxcomb had his fathers heart in
him after all a prisoner wounded ruined languishing for weary years
in Spanish prisons And a sadder day than that was in store when a
gallant fleet should round the Ram Head not with drum and trumpet but
with solemn minuteguns and all flags halfmast high to tell her
that her terrible husbands work was done his terrible heart broken by
failure and fatigue and his body laid by Drakes beneath the faroff
tropic seas

And if at the close of her eventful life one gleam of sunshine opened
for a while when her boy Richard returned to her bosom from his Spanish
prison to be knighted for his valor and made a privy councillor for
his wisdom yet soon how soon was the old cloud to close in again
above her until her weary eyes should open in the light of Paradise
For that son dropped dead some say at the very counciltable leaving
behind him naught but broken fortunes and huge purposes which never
were fulfilled and the stormy star of that bold race was set forever
and Lady Hawkins bowed her weary head and died the groan of those
stolen negroes ringing in her ears having lived long enough to see her
husbands youthful sin become a national institution and a national
curse for generations yet unborn

I know not why she opened her heart that night to Adrian Gilbert with
a frankness which she would hardly have dared to use to her own family
Perhaps it was that Adrian like his great brothers Humphrey and
Raleigh was a man full of all lofty and delicate enthusiasms tender
and poetical such as women cling to when their hearts are lonely but
so it was and Adrian half ashamed of his own ambitious dreams sate
looking at her a while in silence and then

The Lord be with you dearest lady Strange how you women sit at home
to love and suffer while we men rush forth to break our hearts and
yours against rocks of our own seeking Ah well were it not for
Scripture I should have thought that Adam rather than Eve had been
the one who plucked the fruit of the forbidden tree

We women I fear did the deed nevertheless for we bear the doom of it
our lives long

You always remind me madam of my dear Mrs Leigh of Burrough and her
counsels

Do you see her often I hear of her as one of the Lords most precious
vessels

I would have done more ere now than see her said he with a blush
had she allowed me but she lives only for the memory of her husband
and the fame of her noble sons

As he spoke the door opened and in walked wrapped in his rough
seagown none other than one of those said noble sons

Adrian turned pale

Amyas Leigh What brings you hither how fares my brother Where is the
ship

Your brother is well Mr Gilbert The Golden Hind is gone on to
Dartmouth with Mr Hayes I came ashore here meaning to go north to
Bideford ere I went to London I called at Drakes just now but he was
away

The Golden Hind What brings her home so soon

Yet welcome ever sir said Mrs Hawkins This is a great surprise
though Captain John did not look for you till next year

Amyas was silent

Something is wrong cried Adrian Speak

Amyas tried but could not

Will you drive a man mad sir Has the adventure failed You said my
brother was well

He is well

Then whatWhy do you look at me in that fashion sir and springing
up Adrian rushed forward and held the candle to Amyass face

Amyass lip quivered as he laid his hand on Adrians shoulder

Your great and glorious brother sir is better bestowed than in
settling Newfoundland

Dead shrieked Adrian

He is with the God whom he served

He was always with Him like Enoch parable me no parables if you love
me sir

And like Enoch he was not for God took him

Adrian clasped his hands over his forehead and leaned against the
table

Go on sir go on God will give me strength to hear all

And gradually Amyas opened to Adrian that tragic story which Mr Hayes
has long ago told far too well to allow a second edition of it from me
of the unruliness of the men ruffians as I said before caught up at
haphazard of conspiracies to carry off the ships plunder of fishing
vessels desertions multiplying daily licenses from the general to the
lazy and fearful to return home till Adrian broke out with a groan

From him Conspired against him Deserted from him Dotards buzzards
Where would they have found such another leader

Your illustrious brother sir said Amyas if you will pardon me was
a very great philosopher but not so much of a general

General sir Where was braver man

Not on Gods earth but that does not make a general sir If Cortez
had been brave and no more Mexico would have been Mexico still The
truth is sir Cortez like my Captain Drake knew when to hang a man
and your great brother did not

Amyas as I suppose was right Gilbert was a man who could be angry
enough at baseness or neglect but who was too kindly to punish it he
was one who could form the wisest and bestdigested plans but who could
not stoop to that hailfellowwellmet drudgery among his subordinates
which has been the talisman of great captains

Then Amyas went on to tell the rest of his story the setting sail from
St Johns to discover the southward coast Sir Humphreys chivalrous
determination to go in the little Squirrel of only ten tons and
overcharged with nettings fights and small ordnance not only
because she was more fit to examine the creeks but because he had heard
of some taunt against him among the men that he was afraid of the sea

After that woe on woe how seven days after they left Cape Raz their
largest ship the Delight after she had most part of the night I
quote Hayes like the swan that singeth before her death continued in
sounding of trumpets drums and fifes also winding of the comets and
hautboys and in the end of their jollity left off with the battle and
doleful knells struck the next day the Golden Hind and the Squirrel
sheering off just in time upon unknown shoals where were lost all but
fourteen and among them Franks philosopher friend poor Budaeus and
those who escaped after all horrors of cold and famine were cast on
shore in Newfoundland How worn out with hunger and want of clothes
the crews of the two remaining ships persuaded Sir Humphrey to sail
toward England on the 31st of August and on that very instant even in
winding about beheld close alongside a very lion in shape hair and
color not swimming but sliding on the water with his whole body who
passed along turning his head to and fro yawning and gaping wide
with ugly demonstration of long teeth and glaring eyes and to bid us
farewell coming right against the Hind he sent forth a horrible voice
roaring or bellowing as doth a lion What opinion others had thereof
and chiefly the general himself I forbear to deliver but he took it
for bonum omen rejoicing that he was to war against such an enemy if
it were the devil

And the devil it was doubtless said Adrian the roaring lion who
goes about seeking whom he may devour

He has not got your brother at least quoth Amyas

No rejoined Mrs Hawkins smile not reader for those were days in
which men believed in the devil he roared for joy to think how many
poor souls would be left still in heathen darkness by Sir Humphreys
death God be with that good knight and send all mariners where he is
now

Then Amyas told the last scene how when they were off the Azores the
storms came on heavier than ever with terrible seas breaking short
and pyramidwise till on the 9th September the tiny Squirrel nearly
foundered and yet recovered and the general sitting abaft with a
book in his hand cried out to us in the Hind so oft as we did approach
within hearing We are as near heaven by sea as by land reiterating
the same speech well beseeming a soldier resolute in Jesus Christ as I
can testify he was

The same Monday about twelve of the clock or not long after the
frigate the Squirrel being ahead of us in the Golden Hind suddenly
her lights were out and withal our watch cried the general was cast
away which was true for in that moment the frigate was devoured and
swallowed up of the sea

And so ended I have used Hayes own words Amyas Leighs story

Oh my brother my brother moaned poor Adrian the glory of his
house the glory of Devon

Ah what will the queen say asked Mrs Hawkins through her tears

Tell me asked Adrian had he the jewel on when he died

The queens jewel He always wore that and his own posy too Mutare
vel timere sperno He wore it and he lived it

Ay said Adrian the same to the last

Not quite that said Amyas He was a meeker man latterly than he used
to be As he said himself once a better refiner than any whom he had on
board had followed him close all the seas over and purified him in the
fire And gold seven times tried he was when God having done His work
in him took him home at last

And so the talk ended There was no doubt that the expedition had
been an utter failure Adrian was a ruined man and Amyas had lost his
venture

Adrian rose and begged leave to retire he must collect himself

Poor gentleman said Mrs Hawkins it is little else he has left to
collect

Or I either said Amyas I was going to ask you to lend me one of
your sons shirts and five pounds to get myself and my men home

Five Fifty Mr Leigh God forbid that John Hawkinss wife should
refuse her last penny to a distressed mariner and he a gentleman born
But you must eat and drink

Its more than I have done for many a day worth speaking of

And Amyas sat down in his rags to a good supper while Mrs Hawkins told
him all the news which she could of his mother whom Adrian Gilbert had
seen a few months before in London and then went on naturally enough
to the Bideford news

And by the by Captain Leigh Ive sad news for you from your place
and I had it from one who was there at the time You must know a Spanish
captain a prisoner

What the one I sent home from Smerwick

You sent Mercy on us Then perhaps youve heard

How can I have heard What

That hes gone off the villain

Without paying his ransom

I cant say that but theres a poor innocent young maid gone off with
him one Salternes daughterthe Popish serpent

Rose Salterne the mayors daughter the Rose of Torridge

Thats her Bless your dear soul what ails you

Amyas had dropped back in his seat as if he had been shot but he
recovered himself before kind Mrs Hawkins could rush to the cupboard
for cordials

Youll forgive me madam but Im weak from the sea and your good ale
has turned me a bit dizzy I think

Ay yes tis too too heavy till youve been on shore a while Try
the aqua vitae my Captain John has it right good and a bit too fond of
it too poor dear soul between whiles Heaven forgive him

So she poured some strong brandy and water down Amyass throat in spite
of his refusals and sent him to bed but not to sleep and after a
night of tossing he started for Bideford having obtained the means for
so doing from Mrs Hawkins



CHAPTER XIV

HOW SALVATION YEO SLEW THE KING OF THE GUBBINGS

 Ignorance and evil even in full flight deal terrible backhanded
 strokes at their pursuersHELPS

Now I am sorry to say for the honor of my country that it was by no
means a safe thing in those days to travel from Plymouth to the north of
Devon because to get to your journeys end unless you were minded to
make a circuit of many miles you must needs pass through the territory
of a foreign and hostile potentate who had many times ravaged the
dominions and defeated the forces of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and
was named behind his back at least the King of the Gubbings So now
I dare call them says Fuller secured by distance which one of more
valor durst not do to their face for fear their fury fall upon him Yet
hitherto have I met with none who could render a reason of their name
We call the shavings of fish which are little worth gubbings and sure
it is that they are sensible that the word importeth shame and disgrace

As for the suggestion of my worthy and learned friend Mr Joseph
Maynard that such as did inhabitare montes gibberosos were called
Gubbings such will smile at the ingenuity who dissent from the truth of
the etymology

I have read of an England beyond Wales but the Gubbings land is a
Scythia within England and they pure heathens therein It lieth nigh
Brent For in the edge of Dartmoor it is reported that some two hundred
years since two bad women being with child fled thither to hide
themselves to whom certain lewd fellows resorted and this was their
first original They are a peculiar of their own making exempt from
bishop archdeacon and all authority either ecclesiastical or civil
They live in cots rather holes than houses like swine having all in
common multiplied without marriage into many hundreds Their language
is the dross of the dregs of the vulgar Devonian and the more learned
a man is the worse he can understand them During our civil wars no
soldiers were quartered upon them for fear of being quartered amongst
them Their wealth consisteth in other mens goods they live by
stealing the sheep on the moors and vain is it for any to search their
houses being a work beneath the pains of any sheriff and above the
power of any constable Such is their fleetness they will outrun many
horses vivaciousness they outlive most men living in an ignorance of
luxury the extinguisher of life They hold together like bees offend
one and all will revenge his quarrel

But now I am informed that they begin to be civilized and tender their
children to baptism and return to be men yea Christians again I hope
no CIVIL people amongst us will turn barbarians now these barbarians
begin to be civilized

  Fuller p 398

With which quip against the Anabaptists of his day Fuller ends his
story and I leave him to set forth how Amyas in fear of these same
Scythians and heathens rode out of Plymouth on a right good horse in
his full suit of armor carrying lance and sword and over and above two
great dags or horsepistols and behind him Salvation Yeo and five
or six north Devon men who had served with him in Ireland and were
returning on furlough clad in headpieces and quilted jerkins each
man with his pike and sword and Yeo with arquebuse and match while two
sumpter ponies carried the baggage of this formidable troop

They pushed on as fast as they could through Tavistock to reach before
nightfall Lydford where they meant to sleep but what with buying the
horses and other delays they had not been able to start before
noon and night fell just as they reached the frontiers of the enemys
country A dreary place enough it was by the wild glare of sunset A
high tableland of heath banked on the right by the crags and hills of
Dartmoor and sloping away to the south and west toward the foot of the
great cone of BrentTor which towered up like an extinct volcano as
some say that it really is crowned with the tiny church the votive
offering of some Plymouth merchant of old times who vowed in sore
distress to build a church to the Blessed Virgin on the first point of
English land which he should see Far away down those waste slopes
they could see the tiny threads of blue smoke rising from the dens of
the Gubbings and more than once they called a halt to examine whether
distant furzebushes and ponies might not be the patrols of an advancing
army It is all very well to laugh at it now in the nineteenth century
but it was no laughing matter then as they found before they had gone
two miles farther

On the middle of the down stood a wayside inn a desolate and
villainouslooking lump of lichenspotted granite with windows
paperpatched and rotting thatch kept down by stones and strawbanks
and at the back a rambling courtledge of barns and walls around which
pigs and barefoot children grunted in loving communion of dirt At the
door rapt apparently in the contemplation of the mountain peaks which
glowed rich orange in the last lingering sunrays but really watching
which way the sheep on the moor were taking stood the innkeeper a
brawny soddenvisaged bleareyed six feet of brutishness holding up
his hose with one hand for want of points and clawing with the other
his elflocks on which a fair sprinkling of feathers might denote
first that he was just out of bed having been out sheepstealing
all the night before and secondly that by natural genius he had
anticipated the opinion of that great apostle of sluttishness
Fridericus Dedekind and his faithful disciple Dekker which last speaks
thus to all gulls and grobians Consider that as those trees of cobweb
lawn woven by spinners in the fresh May mornings do dress the curled
heads of the mountains and adorn the swelling bosoms of the valleys or
as those snowy fleeces which the naked briar steals from the innocent
sheep to make himself a warm winter livery are to either of them
both an excellent ornament so make thou account that to have feathers
sticking here and there on thy head will embellish thee and set thy
crown out rarely None dare upbraid thee that like a beggar thou hast
lain on straw or like a travelling pedlar upon musty flocks for those
feathers will rise up as witnesses to choke him that says so and to
prove thy bed to have been of the softest down Even so did those
feathers bear witness that the possessor of Rogues Harbor Inn on
BrentTor Down whatever else he lacked lacked not geese enough to keep
him in soft lying

Presently he spies Amyas and his party coming slowly over the hill
pricks up his ears and counts them sees Amyass armor shakes his head
and grunts and then being a man of few words utters a sleepy howl

MirooiFushing pooale

A strapping lasswhose only covering for country women at work in
those days dispensed with the ornament of a gown is a green bodice and
red petticoat neither of them over amplebrings out his fishingrod
and basket and the man having tied up his hose with some ends of
string examines the footlink

Don vlies gone

May be says Mary shouldnt hay left mun out to coort May be old
hens ate mun off I see her chocking about a while agone

The host receives this intelligence with an oath and replies by a
violent blow at Marys head which she accustomed to such slight
matters dodges and then returns the blow with good effect on the shock
head

Whereon mine host equally accustomed to such slight matters quietly
shambles off howling as he departs

Tell Patrico

Mary runs in combs her hair slips a pair of stockings and her best
gown over her dirt and awaits the coming guests who make a few long
faces at the mucksy sort of a place but prefer to spend the night
there than to bivouac close to the enemys camp

So the old hen who has swallowed the dun fly is killed plucked and
roasted and certain black Dartmoor mutton is put on the gridiron and
being compelled to confess the truth by that fiery torment proclaims
itself to all noses as reddeer venison In the meanwhile Amyas has put
his horse and the ponies into a shed to which he can find neither
lock nor key and therefore returns grumbling not without fear for his
steeds safety The baggage is heaped in a corner of the room and Amyas
stretches his legs before a turf fire while Yeo who has his notions
about the place posts himself at the door and the men are seized with
a desire to superintend the cooking probably to be attributed to the
fact that Mary is cook

Presently Yeo comes in again

Theres a gentleman just coming up sir all alone

Ask him to make one of our party then with my compliments Yeo goes
out and returns in five minutes

Please sir hes gone in back ways by the court

Well he has an odd taste if he makes himself at home here

Out goes Yeo again and comes back once more after five minutes in high
excitement

Come out sir for goodness sake come out Ive got him Safe as a rat
in a trap I have

Who

A Jesuit sir

Nonsense man

I tell you truth sir I went round the house for I didnt like the
looks of him as he came up I knew he was one of them villains the
minute he came up by the way he turned in his toes and put down his
feet so still and careful like as if he was afraid of offending God at
every step So I just put my eye between the wall and the dern of the
gate and I saw him come up to the back door and knock and call Mary
quite still like any Jesuit and the wench flies out to him ready to
eat him and Go away I heard her say theres a dear man and then
something about a queer cuffin thats a justice in these canters
thieves Latin and with that he takes out a somewhatIll swear it
was one of those Popish Agnusesand gives it her and she kisses it
and crosses herself and asks him if thats the right way and then puts
it into her bosom and he says Bless you my daughter and then I was
sure of the dog and he slips quite still to the stable and peeps in
and when he sees no one there in he goes and out I go and shut to the
door and back a cart that was there up against it and call out one of
the men to watch the stable and the girls crying like mad

What a fools trick man How do you know that he is not some honest
gentleman after all

Fool or none sir honest gentlemen dont give maidens Agnuses Ive
put him in and if you want him let out again you must come and do it
yourself for my conscience is against it sir If the Lords enemies
are delivered into my hand Im answerable sir went on Yeo as Amyas
hurried out with him Tis written If any let one of them go his
life shall be for the life of him

So Amyas ran out pulled back the cart grumbling opened the door and
began a string of apologies tohis cousin Eustace

Yes here he was with such a countenance half foolish half venomous
as reynard wears when the last spadeful of earth is thrown back and
he is revealed sitting disconsolately on his tail within a yard of the
terriers noses

Neither cousin spoke for a minute or two At last Amyas

Well cousin hideandseek how long have you added horsestealing to
your other trades

My dear Amyas said Eustace very meekly I may surely go into an inn
stable without intending to steal what is in it

Of course old fellow said Amyas mollified I was only in jest But
what brings you here Not prudence certainly

I am bound to know no prudence save for the Lords work

Thats giving away Agnus Deis and deceiving poor heathen wenches I
suppose said Yeo

Eustace answered pretty roundly

Heathens Yes truly you Protestants leave these poor wretches
heathens and then insult and persecute those who with a devotion
unknown to you labor at the danger of their lives to make them
Christians Mr Amyas Leigh you can give me up to be hanged at Exeter
if it shall so please you to disgrace your own family but from this
spot neither you no nor all the myrmidons of your queen shall drive
me while there is a soul here left unsaved

Come out of the stable at least said Amyas you dont want to make
the horses Papists as well as the asses do you Come out man and go
to the devil your own way I shant inform against you and Yeo here
will hold his tongue if I tell him I know

It goes sorely against my conscience sir but being that he is your
cousin of course

Of course and now come in and eat with me suppers just ready and
bygones shall be bygones if you will have them so

How much forgiveness Eustace felt in his heart I know not but he knew
of course that he ought to forgive and to go in and eat with Amyas was
to perform an act of forgiveness and for the best of motives too for
by it the cause of the Church might be furthered and acts and motives
being correct what more was needed So in he went and yet he never
forgot that scar upon his cheek and Amyas could not look him in the
face but Eustace must fancy that his eyes were on the scar and peep
up from under his lids to see if there was any smile of triumph on that
honest visage They talked away over the venison guardedly enough at
first but as they went on Amyass straightforward kindliness warmed
poor Eustaces frozen heart and ere they were aware they found
themselves talking over old haunts and old passages of their
boyhooduncles aunts and cousins and Eustace without any sinister
intention asked Amyas why he was going to Bideford while Frank and his
mother were in London

To tell you the truth I cannot rest till I have heard the whole story
about poor Rose Salterne

What about her cried Eustace

Do you not know

How should I know anything here For heavens sake what has happened

Amyas told him wondering at his eagerness for he had never had the
least suspicion of Eustaces love

Eustace shrieked aloud

Fool fool that I have been Caught in my own trap Villain villain
that he is After all he promised me at Lundy

And springing up Eustace stamped up and down the room gnashing
his teeth tossing his head from side to side and clutching with
outstretched hands at the empty air with the horrible gesture Heaven
grant that no reader has ever witnessed it of that despair which still
seeks blindly for the object which it knows is lost forever

Amyas sat thunderstruck His first impulse was to ask Lundy What
knew you of him What had he or you to do at Lundy but pity conquered
curiosity

Oh Eustace And you then loved her too

Dont speak to me Loved her Yes sir and had as good a right to love
her as any one of your precious Brotherhood of the Rose Dont speak to
me I say or I shall do you a mischief

So Eustace knew of the brotherhood too Amyas longed to ask him how but
what use in that If he knew it he knew it and what harm So he only
answered

My good cousin why be wroth with me If you really love her now is
the time to take counsel with me how best we shall

Eustace did not let him finish his sentence Conscious that he had
betrayed himself upon more points than one he stopped short in his
walk suddenly collected himself by one great effort and eyed Amyas
from underneath his brows with the old down look

How best we shall do what my valiant cousin said he in a meaning
and halfscornful voice What does your most chivalrous Brotherhood of
the Rose purpose in such a case

Amyas a little nettled stood on his guard in return and answered
bluntly

What the Brotherhood of the Rose will do I cant yet say What it
ought to do I have a pretty sure guess

So have I To hunt her down as you would an outlaw because forsooth
she has dared to love a Catholic to murder her lover in her arms and
drag her home again stained with his blood to be forced by threats and
persecution to renounce that Church into whose maternal bosom she has
doubtless long since found rest and holiness

If she has found holiness it matters little to me where she has found
it Master Eustace but that is the very point that I should be glad to
know for certain

And you will go and discover for yourself

Have you no wish to discover it also

And if I had what would that be to you

Only said Amyas trying hard to keep his temper that if we had the
same purpose we might sail in the same ship

You intend to sail then

I mean simply that we might work together

Our paths lie on very different roads sir

I am afraid you never spoke a truer word sir In the meanwhile ere we
part be so kind as to tell me what you meant by saying that you had met
this Spaniard at Lundy

I shall refuse to answer that

You will please to recollect Eustace that however good friends we
have been for the last halfhour you are in my power I have a right to
know the bottom of this matter and by heaven I will know it

In your power See that you are not in mine Remember sir that you
are within awithin a few miles at least of those who will obey me
their Catholic benefactor but who owe no allegiance to those Protestant
authorities who have left them to the lot of the beasts which perish

Amyas was very angry He wanted but little more to make him catch
Eustace by the shoulders shake the life out of him and deliver him
into the tender guardianship of Yeo but he knew that to take him at
all was to bring certain death on him and disgrace on the family and
remembering Franks conduct on that memorable night at Clovelly he kept
himself down

Take me said Eustace if you will sir You who complain of us that
we keep no faith with heretics will perhaps recollect that you asked me
into this room as your guest and that in your good faith I trusted when
I entered it

The argument was a worthless one in law for Eustace had been a prisoner
before he was a guest and Amyas was guilty of something very like
misprision of treason in not handing him over to the nearest justice
However all he did was to go to the door open it and bowing to his
cousin bid him walk out and go to the devil since he seemed to have
set his mind on ending his days in the company of that personage

Whereon Eustace vanished

Pooh said Amyas to himself I can find out enough and too much I
fear without the help of such crooked vermin I must see Cary I must
see Salterne and I suppose if I am ready to do my duty I shall learn
somehow what it is Now to sleep tomorrow up and away to what God
sends

Come in hither men shouted he down the passage and sleep here
Havent you had enough of this villainous sour cider

The men came in yawning and settled themselves to sleep on the floor

Wheres Yeo

No one knew he had gone out to say his prayers and had not returned

Never mind said Amyas who suspected some plot on the old mans part
Hell take care of himself Ill warrant him

No fear of that sir and the four tars were soon snoring in concert
round the fire while Amyas laid himself on the settle with his saddle
for a pillow

     


It was about midnight when Amyas leaped to his feet or rather fell
upon his back upsetting saddle settle and finally table under the
notion that ten thousand flying dragons were bursting in the window
close to his ear with howls most fierce and fell The flying dragons
past however being only a flock of terrorstricken geese which flew
flapping and screaming round the corner of the house but the noise
which had startled them did not pass and another minute made it evident
that a sharp fight was going on in the courtyard and that Yeo was
hallooing lustily for help

Out turned the men sword in hand burst the back door open stumbling
over pails and pitchers and into the courtyard where Yeo his back
against the stabledoor was holding his own manfully with sword and
buckler against a dozen men

Dire and manifold was the screaming geese screamed chickens screamed
pigs screamed donkeys screamed Mary screamed from an upper window
and to complete the chorus a flock of plovers attracted by the noise
wheeled round and round overhead and added their screams also to that
Dutch concert

The screaming went on but the fight ceased for as Amyas rushed into
the yard the whole party of ruffians took to their heels and vanished
over a low hedge at the other end of the yard

Are you hurt Yeo

Not a scratch thank Heaven But Ive got two of them the ringleaders
I have One of thems against the wall Your horse did for tother

The wounded man was lifted up a huge ruffian nearly as big as Amyas
himself Yeos sword had passed through his body He groaned and choked
for breath

Carry him indoors Where is the other

Dead as a herring in the straw Have a care men have a care how you
go in the horses are near mad

However the man was brought out after a while With him all was over
They could feel neither pulse nor breath

Carry him in too poor wretch And now Yeo what is the meaning of all
this

Yeos story was soon told He could not get out of his Puritan head the
notion quite unfounded of course that Eustace had meant to steal
the horses He had seen the innkeeper sneak off at their approach and
expecting some nightattack he had taken up his lodging for the night
in the stable

As he expected an attempt was made The door was opened how he could
not guess for he had fastened it inside and two fellows came in and
began to loose the beasts Yeos account was that he seized the big
fellow who drew a knife on him and broke loose the horses terrified
at the scuffle kicked right and left one man fell and the other
ran out calling for help with Yeo at his heels Whereon said
Yeo seeing a dozen more on me with clubs and bows I thought best to
shorten the number while I could ran the rascal through and stood on
my ward and only just in time I was whats more theres two arrows in
the house wall and two or three more in my buckler which I caught up
as I went out for I had hung it close by the door you see sir to be
all ready in case said the cunning old Philistineslayer as they went
in after the wounded man

But hardly had they stumbled through the low doorway into the
backkitchen when a fresh hubbub arose insidemore shouts for help
Amyas ran forward breaking his head against the doorway and beheld as
soon as he could see for the flashes in his eyes an old acquaintance
held on each side by a sturdy sailor

With one arm in the sleeve of his doublet and the other in a not over
spotless shirt holding up his hose with one hand and with the other
a candle whereby he had lighted himself to his own confusion foaming
with rage stood Mr Evan Morgans alias Father Parsons looking
between his confused habiliments and his fiery visage as Yeo told him
to his face the very moral of a halfplucked turkeycock And behind
him dressed stood Eustace Leigh

We found the maid letting these here two out by the front door said
one of the captors

Well Mr Parsons said Amyas and what are you about here A pretty
nest of thieves and Jesuits we seem to have routed out this evening

About my calling sir said Parsons stoutly By your leave I
shall prepare this my wounded lamb for that account to which your mans
cruelty has untimely sent him

The wounded man who lay upon the floor heard Parsons voice and
moaned for the Patrico

You see sir said he pompously the sheep know their shepherds
voice

The wolves you mean you hypocritical scoundrel said Amyas who could
not contain his disgust Let the fellow truss up his points lads and
do his work After all the man is dying

The requisite matters sir are not at hand said Parsons unabashed

Eustace go and fetch his matters for him you seem to be in all his
plots

Eustace went silently and sullenly

Whats that fresh noise at the back now

The maid sir a wailing over her uncle the fellow that we saw sneak
away when we came up It was him the horse killed

It was true The wretched host had slipped off on their approach simply
to call the neighboring outlaws to the spoil and he had been filled
with the fruit of his own devices

His blood be on his own head said Amyas

I question sir said Yeo in a low voice whether some of it will
not be on the heads of those proud prelates who go clothed in purple
and fine linen instead of going forth to convert such as he and then
wonder how these Jesuits get hold of them If they give place to the
devil in their sheepfolds sure hell come in and lodge there Look
sir theres a sight in a gospel land

And indeed the sight was curious enough For Parsons was kneeling by
the side of the dying man listening earnestly to the confession which
the man sobbed out in his gibberish between the spasms of his wounded
chest Now and then Parsons shook his head and when Eustace returned
with the holy wafer and the oil for extreme unction he asked him in a
low voice Ballard interpret for me

And Eustace knelt down on the other side of the sufferer and
interpreted his thieves dialect into Latin and the dying man held
a hand of each and turned first to one and then to the other stupid
eyesnot without affection though and gratitude

I cant stand this mummery any longer said Yeo Heres a soul
perishing before my eyes and its on my conscience to speak a word in
season

Silence whispered Amyas holding him back by the arm he knows them
and he dont know you they are the first who ever spoke to him as if
he had a soul to be saved and first come first served you can do no
good See the mans face is brightening already

But sir tis a false peace

At all events he is confessing his sins Yeo and if thats not good
for him and you and me what is

Yea Amen sir but this is not to the right person

How do you know his words will not go to the right person after all
though he may not send them there By heaven the man is dead

It was so The dark catalogue of brutal deeds had been gasped out but
ere the words of absolution could follow the head had fallen back and
all was over

Confession in extremis is sufficient said Parsons to Eustace
Ballard as Parsons called him to Amyass surprise as he rose As
for the rest the intention will be accepted instead of the act

The Lord have mercy on his soul said Eustace

His soul is lost before our very eyes said Yeo

Mind your own business said Amyas

Humph but Ill tell you sir what our business is if youll step
aside with me I find that poor fellow that lies dead is none other than
the leader of the Gubbings the king of them as they dare to call him

Well what of that

Mark my words sir if we have not a hundred stout rogues upon us
before two hours are out forgive us they never will and if we get off
with our lives which I dont much expect we shall leave our horses
behind for we can hold the house sir well enough till morning but
the courtyard we cant thats certain

We had better march at once then

Think sir if they catch us upas they are sure to do knowing the
country better than wehow will our shot stand their arrows

True old wisdom we must keep the road and we must keep together and
so be a mark for them while they will be behind every rock and bank
and two or three flights of arrows will do our business for us Humph
stay I have a plan And stepping forward he spoke

Eustace you will be so kind as to go back to your lambs and tell
them that if they meddle with us cruel wolves again tonight we are
ready and willing to fight to the death and have plenty of shot and
powder at their service Father Parsons you will be so kind as to
accompany us it is but fitting that the shepherd should be hostage for
his sheep

If you carry me off this spot sir you carry my corpse only said
Parsons I may as well die here as be hanged elsewhere like my
martyred brother Campian

If you take him you must take me too said Eustace

What if we wont

How will you gain by that you can only leave me here You cannot make
me go to the Gubbings if I do not choose

Amyas uttered sotto voce an anathema on Jesuits Gubbings and things in
general He was in a great hurry to get to Bideford and he feared that
this business would delay him as it was a day or two He wanted to
hang Parsons he did not want to hang Eustace and Eustace he knew
was well aware of that latter fact and played his game accordingly but
time ran on and he had to answer sulkily enough

Well then if you Eustace will go and give my message to your
converts I will promise to set Mr Parsons free again before we come to
Lydford town and I advise you if you have any regard for his life
to see that your eloquence be persuasive enough for as sure as I am
an Englishman and he none if the Gubbings attack us the first
bullet that I shall fire at them will have gone through his scoundrelly
brains

Parsons still kicked

Very well then my merry men all Tie this gentlemans hands behind
his back get the horses out and well right away up into Dartmoor
find a good high tor stand our ground there till morning and then
carry him into Okehampton to the nearest justice If he chooses to delay
me in my journey it is fair that I should make him pay for it

Whereon Parsons gave in and being fast tied by his arm to Amyass
saddle trudged alongside his horse for several weary miles while Yeo
walked by his side like a friar by a condemned criminal and in order
to keep up his spirits told him the woful end of Nicholas Saunders the
Legate and how he was found starved to death in a bog

And if you wish sir to follow in his blessed steps which I heartily
hope you will do you have only to go over that big cowbacked hill
there on your right hand and down again the other side to Crawmere
pool and there youll find as pretty a bog to die in as ever Jesuit
needed and your ghost may sit there on a grass tummock and tell your
beads without any one asking for you till the day of judgment and much
good may it do you

At which imagination Yeo was actually heard for the first and last time
in this history to laugh most heartily

His hohos had scarcely died away when they saw shining under the moon
the old tower of Lydford castle

Cast the fellow off now said Amyas

Ay ay sir and Yeo and Simon Evans stopped behind and did not come
up for ten minutes after

What have you been about so long

Why sir said Evans you see the man had a very fair pair of hose
on and a brannew kersey doublet very warmlined and so thinking it
a pity good clothes should be wasted on such noxious trade weve just
brought them along with us

Spoiling the Egyptians said Yeo as comment

And what have you done with the man

Hove him over the bank sir he pitched into a big furzebush and for
aught I know there hell bide

You rascal have you killed him

Never fear sir said Yeo in his cool fashion A Jesuit has as many
lives as a cat and I believe rides broomsticks post like a witch He
would be at Lydford now before us if his master Satan had any business
for him there

Leaving on their left Lydford and its illomened castle which a
century after was one of the principal scenes of Judge Jeffreyss
cruelty Amyas and his party trudged on through the mire toward
Okehampton till sunrise and ere the vapors had lifted from the mountain
tops they were descending the long slopes from Sourton down while
Yestor and Amicombe slept steep and black beneath their misty pall and
roaring far below unseen

 Ockment leapt from crag and cloud
 Down her cataracts laughing loud

The voice of the stream recalled these words to Amyass mind The nymph
of Torridge had spoken them upon the day of his triumph He recollected
too his vexation on that day at not seeing Rose Salterne Why he had
never seen her since Never seen her now for six years and more Of her
ripened beauty he knew only by hearsay she was still to him the lovely
fifteen years girl for whose sake he had smitten the Barnstaple draper
over the quay What a chain of petty accidents had kept them from
meeting though so often within a mile of each other And what a lucky
one said practical old Amyas to himself If I had seen her as she is
now I might have loved her as Frank doespoor Frank what will he
say What does he say for he must know it already And what ought I to
sayto do rather for talking is no use on this side the grave nor on
the other either I expect And then he asked himself whether his old
oath meant nothing or something whether it was a mere tavern frolic or
a sacred duty And he held the more that he looked at it that it meant
the latter

But what could he do He had nothing on earth but his sword so he could
not travel to find her After all she might not be gone far Perhaps
not gone at all It might be a mistake an exaggerated scandal He
would hope so And yet it was evident that there had been some passages
between her and Don Guzman Eustaces mysterious words about the promise
at Lundy proved that The villain He had felt all along that he was a
villain but just the one to win a womans heart too Frank had been
awayall the Brotherhood away What a fool he had been to turn the
wolf loose into the sheepfold And yet who would have dreamed of
it   

At all events said Amyas trying to comfort himself I need not
complain I have lost nothing I stood no more chance of her against
Frank than I should have stood against the Don So there is no use for
me to cry about the matter And he tried to hum a tune concerning the
general frailty of women but nevertheless like Sir Hugh felt that he
had a great disposition to cry

He never had expected to win her and yet it seemed bitter to know that
she was lost to him forever It was not so easy for a heart of his make
to toss away the image of a first love and all the less easy because
that image was stained and ruined

Curses on the man who had done that deed I will yet have his hearts
blood somehow if I go round the world again to find him If theres no
law for it on earth theres law in heaven or Im much mistaken

With which determination he rode into the ugly dirty and stupid town
of Okehampton with which fallen man by some strange perversity has
chosen to defile one of the loveliest sites in the pleasant land of
Devon And heartily did Amyas abuse the old town that day for he was
detained there as he expected full three hours while the Justice
Shallow of the place was sent for from his farm whither he had gone
at sunrise after the earlyrising fashion of those days to take Yeos
deposition concerning last nights affray Moreover when Shallow came
he refused to take the depositions because they ought to have been made
before a brother Shallow at Lydford and in the wrangling which ensued
was very near finding out what Amyas fearing fresh loss of time and
worse evils beside had commanded to be concealed namely the presence
of Jesuits in that Moorland Utopia Then in broadest Devon

And do you call this Christian conduct sir to set a quiet man like me
upon they Gubbings as if I was going to risk my precious lifeno nor
ever a constable to Okehampton neither Let Lydfor men mind Lydfor
roogs and by Lydfor law if they will hang first and try after but
as for me Ive rade my Bible and He that meddleth with strife is like
him that taketh a dog by the ears So if you choose to sit down and ate
your breakfast with me well and good but depositions Ill have none
If your man is enquired for youll be answerable for his appearing in
course but I expect mortally with a wink you waint hear much more
of the matter from any hand Leave well alone is a good rule but leave
ill alone is a betterSo we says round about here and so youll say
captain when you be so old as I

So Amyas sat down and ate his breakfast and went on afterwards a long
and weary days journey till he saw at last beneath him the broad
shining river and the long bridge and the white houses piled up the
hillside and beyond over Raleigh downs the dear old tower of Northam
Church

Alas Northam was altogether a desert to him then and Bideford as it
turned out hardly less so For when he rode up to Sir Richards door
he found that the good knight was still in Ireland and Lady Grenville
at Stow Whereupon he rode back again down the High Street to that same
bowwindowed Ship Tavern where the Brotherhood of the Rose made their
vow and settled himself in the very room where they had supped

Ah Mr LeighCaptain Leigh now I beg pardon quoth mine host
Bideford is an empty place nowadays and nothing stirring sir What
with Sir Richard to Ireland and Sir John to London and all the young
gentlemen to the wars theres no one to buy good liquor and no one to
court the young ladies neither Sack sir I hope so I havent brewed
a gallon of it this fortnight if youll believe me ale sir and aqua
vitae and such lowbred trade is all I draw nowadays Try a pint of
sherry sir now to give you an appetite You mind my sherry of old
Jane Sherry and sugar quick while I pull off the captains boots

Amyas sat weary and sad while the innkeeper chattered on

Ah sir two or three like you would set the young ladies all alive
again Bytheby theres been strange doings among them since you were
here last You mind Mistress Salterne

For Gods sake dont let us have that story man I heard enough of it
at Plymouth said Amyas in so disturbed a tone that mine host looked
up and said to himself

Ah poor young gentleman hes one of the hardhit ones

How is the old man asked Amyas after a pause

Bears it well enough sir but a changed man Never speaks to a soul
if he can help it Some folk say hes not right in his head or turned
miser or somewhat and takes naught but bread and water and sits up
all night in the room as was hers turning over her garments Heaven
knows whats on his mindthey do say he was over hard on her and that
drove her to it All I know is he has never been in here for a drop
of liquor and he came as regular every evening as the town clock sir
since she went except a ten days ago and then he met young Mr Cary at
the door and I heard him ask Mr Cary when you would be home sir

Put on my boots again Ill go and see him

Bless you sir What without your sack

Drink it yourself man

But you wouldnt go out again this time o night on an empty stomach
now

Fill my mens stomachs for them and never mind mine Its marketday
is it not Send out and see whether Mr Cary is still in town and
Amyas strode out and along the quay to Bridgeland Street and knocked
at Mr Salternes door

Salterne himself opened it with his usual stern courtesy

I saw you coming up the street sir I have been expecting this honor
from you for some time past I dreamt of you only last night and many
a night before that too Welcome sir into a lonely house I trust the
good knight your general is well

The good knight my general is with God who made him Mr Salterne

Dead sir

Foundered at sea on our way home and the Delight lost too

Humph growled Salterne after a minutes silence I had a venture in
her I suppose its gone No matterI can afford it sir and more
I trust And he was three years younger than I And Draper Heard was
buried yesterday five years youngerHow is it that every one can die
except me Come in sir come in I have forgotten my manners

And he led Amyas into his parlor and called to the apprentices to run
one way and to the cook to run another

You must not trouble yourself to get me supper indeed

I must though sir and the best of wine too and old Salterne had a
good tap of Alicant in old time old time old time sir and you must
drink it now whether he does or not and out he bustled

Amyas sat still wondering what was coming next and puzzled at the
sudden hilarity of the man as well as his hospitality so different
from what the innkeeper had led him to expect

In a minute more one of the apprentices came in to lay the cloth and
Amyas questioned him about his master

Thank the Lord that you are come sir said the lad

Why then

Because therell be a chance of us poor fellows getting a little broken
meat Wem halfstarved this three monthsbread and dripping bread and
dripping oh dear sir And now hes sent out to the inn for chickens
and game and salads and all that money can buy and down in the cellar
haling out the best of wineAnd the lad smacked his lips audibly at
the thought

Is he out of his mind

I cant tell he saith as how he must save muns money nowadays for
heve a got a great venture on hand but what a be he tellth no man
They callth mun bread and dripping now sir all town over said the
prentice confidentially to Amyas

They do do they sirrah Then they will call me bread and no dripping
tomorrow and old Salterne entering from behind made a dash at the
poor fellows ears but luckily thought better of it having a couple of
bottles in each hand

My dear sir said Amyas you dont mean us to drink all that wine

Why not sir answered Salterne in a grim halfsneering tone
thrusting out his squaregrizzled beard and chin Why not sir why
should I not make merry when I have the honor of a noble captain in my
house one who has sailed the seas sir and cut Spaniards throats and
may cut them again too eh sir Boy wheres the kettle and the sugar

What on earth is the man at quoth Amyas to himselfflattering me
or laughing at me

Yes he ran on half to himself in a deliberate tone evidently
intending to hint more than he said as he began brewing the sackin
plain English hot negus Yes bread and dripping for those who cant
fight Spaniards but the best that money can buy for those who can I
heard of you at Smerwick sirYes bread and dripping for me tooI
cant fight Spaniards but for such as you Look here sir I should
like to feed a crew of such up as youd feed a main of fightingcocks
and then start them with a pair of Sheffield spurs apieceyouve a
good one there to your side sir but dont you think a man might carry
two now and fight as they say those Chineses do a sword to each hand
You could kill more that way Captain Leigh I reckon

Amyas half laughed

One will do Mr Salterne if one is quick enough with it

HumphAhNo use being in a hurry I havent been in a hurry NoI
waited for you and here you are and welcome sir Here comes supper a
light matter sir you see A capon and a brace of partridges I had no
time to feast you as you deserve

And so he ran on all suppertime hardly allowing Amyas to get a word
in edgeways but heaping him with coarse flattery and urging him to
drink till after the cloth was drawn and the two left alone he grew
so outrageous that Amyas was forced to take him to task goodhumoredly

Now my dear sir you have feasted me royally and better far than I
deserve but why will you go about to make me drunk twice over first
with vainglory and then with wine

Salterne looked at him a while fixedly and then sticking out his
chinBecause Captain Leigh I am a man who has all his life tried the
crooked road first and found the straight one the safer after all

Eh sir That is a strange speech for one who bears the character of
the most upright man in Bideford

Humph So I thought myself once sir and well I have proved it But
Ill be plain with you sir Youve heard howhow Ive fared since you
saw me last

Amyas nodded his head

I thought so Shame rides post Now then Captain Leigh listen to me
I being a plain man and a burgher and one that never drew iron in my
life except to mend a pen ask you being a gentleman and a captain
and a man of honor with a weapon to your side and harness to your
backwhat would you do in my place

Humph said Amyas that would very much depend on whether my place
was my own fault or not

And what if it were sir What if all that the charitable folks of
BidefordHeaven reward them for their tender mercieshave been
telling you in the last hour be true sirtrue and yet not half the
truth

Amyas gave a start

Ah you shrink from me Of course a man is too righteous to forgive
those who repent though God is not

God knows sir

Yes sir God does knowall and you shall know a littleas much as I
can tellor you understand Come upstairs with me sir as youll drink
no more I have a liking for you I have watched you from your boyhood
and I can trust you and Ill show you what I never showed to mortal man
but one

And taking up a candle he led the way upstairs while Amyas followed
wondering

He stopped at a door and unlocked it

There come in Those shutters have not been opened since she and
the old man was silent

Amyas looked round the room It was a low wainscoted room such as one
sees in old houses everything was in the most perfect neatness
The snowwhite sheets on the bed were turned down as if ready for an
occupant There were books arranged on the shelves fresh flowers on the
table the dressingtable had all its womans mundus of pins and rings
and brushes even the dressinggown lay over the chairback Everything
was evidently just as it had been left

This was her room sir whispered the old man

Amyas nodded silently and half drew back

You need not be modest about entering it now sir whispered he with
a sort of sneer There has been no frail flesh and blood in it for many
a day

Amyas sighed

I sweep it out myself every morning and keep all tidy See here
and he pulled open a drawer Here are all her gowns and there are her
hoods and thereI know em all by heart now and the place of every
one And there sir

And he opened a cupboard where lay in rows all Roses dolls and the
wornout playthings of her childhood

Thats the pleasantest place of all in the room to me said he
whispering still for it minds me of whenand maybe she may become a
little child once more sir its written in the Scripture you know

Amen said Amyas who felt to his own wonder a big tear stealing
down each cheek

And now he whispered one thing more Look hereand pulling out a
key he unlocked a chest and lifted up tray after tray of necklaces
and jewels furs lawns cloth of gold Look there Two thousand pound
wont buy that chest Twenty years have I been getting those things
together Thats the cream of many a Levant voyage and East Indian
voyage and West Indian voyage My Lady Bath cant match those pearls in
her grand house at Tawstock I got em from a Genoese though and paid
for em Look at that embroidered lawn Theres not such a piece in
London no nor in Alexandria Ill warrant nor short of Calicut where
it came from    Look here again theres a golden cup I bought that
of one that was out with Pizarro in Peru And look here againand
the old man gloated over the treasure

And whom do you think I kept all these for These were for her
weddingdayfor her weddingday For your weddingday if youd been
minded sir Yes yours sir And yet I believe I was so ambitious
that I would not have let her marry under an earl all the while I was
pretending to be too proud to throw her at the head of a squires son
Ah well There was my idol sir I made her mad I pampered her up with
gewgaws and vanity and then because my idol was just what I had made
her I turned again and rent her

And now said he pointing to the open chest that was what I meant
and that pointing to the empty bed was what God meant Never mind
Come downstairs and finish your wine I see you dont care about it all
Why should you you are not her father and you may thank God you are
not Go and be merry while you can young sir    And yet all this
might have been yours Andbut I dont suppose you are one to be won
by moneybut all this may be yours still and twenty thousand pounds to
boot

I want no money sir but what I can earn with my own sword

Earn my money then

What on earth do you want of me

To keep your oath said Salterne clutching his arm and looking up
into his face with searching eyes

My oath How did you know that I had one

Ah you were well ashamed of it I suppose next day A drunken frolic
all about a poor merchants daughter But there is nothing hidden that
shall not be revealed nor done in the closet that is not proclaimed on
the housetops

Ashamed of it sir I never was but I have a right to ask how you came
to know it

What if a poor fat squinny rogue a lowborn fellow even as I am
whom you had baffled and made a laughingstock had come to me in my
loneliness and sworn before God that if you honorable gentlemen would
not keep your words he the clown would

John Brimblecombe

And what if I had brought him where I have brought you and shown
him what I have shown you and instead of standing as stiff as any
Spaniard as you do he had thrown himself on his knees by that bedside
and wept and prayed sir till he opened my hard heart for the first
and last time and I fell down on my sinful knees and wept and prayed by
him

I am not given to weeping Mr Salterne said Amyas and as for
praying I dont know yet what I have to pray for on her account my
business is to work Show me what I can do and when you have done that
it will be full time to upbraid me with not doing it

You can cut that fellows throat

It will take a long arm to reach him

I suppose it is as easy to sail to the Spanish Main as it was to sail
round the world

My good sir said Amyas I have at this moment no more worldly goods
than my clothes and my sword so how to sail to the Spanish Main I
dont quite see

And do you suppose sir that I should hint to you of such a voyage if
I meant you to be at the charge of it No sir if you want two thousand
pounds or five to fit a ship take it Take it sir I hoarded money
for my child and now I will spend it to avenge her

Amyas was silent for a while the old man still held his arm still
looked up steadfastly and fiercely in his face

Bring me home that mans head and take ship prizesall Keep the
gain sir and give me the revenge

Gain Do you think I need bribing sir What kept me silent was the
thought of my mother I dare not go without her leave

Salterne made a gesture of impatience

I dare not sir I must obey my parent whatever else I do

Humph said he If others had obeyed theirs as wellBut you are
right Captain Leigh right You will prosper whoever else does not
Now sir goodnight if you will let me be the first to say so My old
eyes grow heavy early nowadays Perhaps its old age perhaps its
sorrow

So Amyas departed to the inn and there to his great joy found Cary
waiting for him from whom he learnt details which must be kept for
another chapter and which I shall tell for convenience sake in my
own words and not in his

About six weeks after the duel the miller at Stow had come up to
the great house in much tribulation to borrow the bloodhounds Rose
Salterne had vanished in the night no man knew whither

Sir Richard was in Bideford but the old steward took on himself to send
for the keepers and down went the servingmen to the mill with all the
idle lads of the parish at their heels thinking a maidenhunt very good
sport and of course taking a view of the case as favorable as possible
to Rose

They reviled the miller and his wife roundly for hardhearted old
heathens and had no doubt that they had driven the poor maid to throw
herself over cliff or drown herself in the sea while all the women of
Stow on the other hand were of unanimous opinion that the hussy had
gone off with some bad fellow and that pride was sure to have a fall
and so forth

The facts of the case were that all Roses trinkets were left behind
so that she had at least gone off honestly and nothing seemed to be
missing but some of her linen which old Anthony the steward broadly
hinted was likely to be found in other peoples boxes The only trace
was a little footmark under her bedroom window On that the bloodhound
was laid of course in leash and after a premonitory whimper lifted
up his mighty voice and started bellmouthed through the garden gate
and up the lane towing behind him the panting keeper till they reached
the downs above and went straight away for Marslandmouth where the
whole posse comitatus pulled up breathless at the door of Lucy Passmore

Lucy as perhaps I should have said before was now a widow and found
her widowhood not altogether contrary to her interest Her augury about
her old man had been fulfilled he had never returned since the night on
which he put to sea with Eustace and the Jesuits

 Some natural tears she shed but dried them soon

as many of them at least as were not required for purposes of
business and then determined to prevent suspicion by a bold move she
started off to Stow and told Lady Grenville a most pathetic tale how
her husband had gone out to pollock fishing and never returned but how
she had heard horsemen gallop past her window in the dead of night and
was sure they must have been the Jesuits and that they had carried off
her old man by main force and probably after making use of his
services had killed and salted him down for provision on their voyage
back to the Pope at Rome after which she ended by entreating protection
against those Popish skulkers up to Chapel who were sworn to do her a
mischief and by an appeal to Lady Grenvilles sense of justice as to
whether the queen ought not to allow her a pension for having had her
hearts love turned into a sainted martyr by the hands of idolatrous
traitors

Lady Grenville who had a great opinion of Lucys medical skill and
always sent for her if one of the children had a housty i e sore
throat went forth and pleaded the case before Sir Richard with such
effect that Lucy was on the whole better off than ever for the next two
or three years But nowwhat had she to do with Roses disappearance
and indeed where was she herself Her door was fast and round it her
flock of goats stood crying in vain for her to come and milk them
while from the down above her donkeys wandering at their own sweet
will answered the bay of the bloodhound with a burst of harmony

Theym laughing at us keper they neddies sure enough wem lost our
labor here

But the bloodhound after working about the door a while turned down
the glen and never stopped till he reached the margin of the sea

Theym taken water Lets go back and rout out the old witchs
house

Tis just like that old Lucy to lock a poor maid into shame

And returning they attacked the cottage and by a general plebiscitum
ransacked the little dwelling partly in indignation and partly if the
truth be told in the hope of plunder but plunder there was none Lucy
had decamped with all her movable wealth saving the huge black cat
among the embers who at the sight of the bloodhound vanished up the
chimney some said with a strong smell of brimstone and being viewed
outside was chased into the woods where she lived I doubt not many
happy years a scourge to all the rabbits of the glen

The goats and donkeys were driven off up to Stow and the mob returned
a little ashamed of themselves when their brief wrath was past and a
little afraid too of what Sir Richard might say

He when he returned sold the donkeys and goats and gave the money to
the poor promising to refund the same if Lucy returned and gave
herself up to justice But Lucy did not return and her cottage from
which the neighbors shrank as from a haunted place remained as she had
left it and crumbled slowly down to four ferncovered walls past which
the little stream went murmuring on from pool to poolthe only voice
for many a year to come which broke the silence of that lonely glen

A few days afterwards Sir Richard on his way from Bideford to Stow
looked in at Clovelly Court and mentioned with a by the by news
which made Will Cary leap from his seat almost to the ceiling What it
was we know already

And there is no clue asked old Cary for his son was speechless

Only this I hear that some fellow prowling about the cliffs that night
saw a pinnace running for Lundy

Will rose and went hastily out of the room

In half an hour he and three or four armed servants were on board a
trawlingskiff and away to Lundy He did not return for three days
and then brought news that an elderly man seemingly a foreigner had
been lodging for some months past in a part of the ruined Moresco
Castle which was tenanted by one John Braund that a few weeks since a
younger man a foreigner also had joined him from on board a ship the
ship a Flushinger or Easterling of some sort The ship came and went
more than once and the young man in her A few days since a lady and
her maid a stout woman came with him up to the castle and talked with
the elder man a long while in secret abode there all night and then
all three sailed in the morning The fishermen on the beach had heard
the young man call the other father He was a very still man much as a
masspriest might be More they did not know or did not choose to
know

Whereon old Cary and Sir Richard sent Will on a second trip with the
parish constable of Hartland in which huge parish for its sins is
situate the Isle of Lundy ten miles out at sea who returned with the
body of the hapless John Braund farmer fisherman smuggler etc
which worthy after much fruitless examination wherein examinate was
afflicted with extreme deafness and loss of memory departed to Exeter
gaol on a charge of harboring priests Jesuits gipsies and other
suspect and traitorous persons

Poor John Braund whose motive for entertaining the said ugly customers
had probably been not treason but a wife seven children and arrears
of rent did not thrive under the change from the pure air of Lundy to
the pestiferous one of Exeter gaol made infamous but two years after
if I recollect right by a black assizes nearly as fatal as that
more notorious one at Oxford for in it whether by the stench of the
prisoners or by a stream of foul air judge jury counsel and
bystanders numbering among them many members of the best families in
Devon sickened in court and died miserably within a few days

John Braund then took the gaolfever in a week and died raving in
that noisome den his secret if he had one perished with him and
nothing but vague suspicion was left as to Rose Salternes fate That
she had gone off with the Spaniard few doubted but whither and in
what character On that last subject be sure no mercy was shown to
her by many a Bideford dame who had hated the poor girl simply for her
beauty and by many a country lady who had always expected that the
girl would be brought to ruin by the absurd notice beyond what her
station had a right to which was taken of her while every young
maiden aspired to fill the throne which Rose had abdicated So that on
the whole Bideford considered itself as going on as well without poor
Rose as it had done with her or even better And though she lingered
in some hearts still as a fair dream the business and the bustle of
each day soon swept that dream away and her place knew her no more

And Will Cary

He was for a while like a man distracted He heaped himself with all
manner of superfluous reproaches for having as he said first brought
the Rose into disgrace and then driven her into the arms of the
Spaniard while St Leger who was a sensible man enough tried in vain
to persuade him that the fault was not his at all that the two must
have been attached to each other long before the quarrel that it must
have ended so sooner or later that old Salternes harshness rather
than Carys wrath had hastened the catastrophe and finally that the
Rose and her fortunes were now that she had eloped with a Spaniard not
worth troubling their heads about Poor Will would not be so comforted
He wrote off to Frank at Whitehall telling him the whole truth calling
himself all fools and villains and entreating Franks forgiveness to
which he received an answer in which Frank said that Will had no reason
to accuse himself that these strange attachments were due to a
synastria or sympathy of the stars which ruled the destinies of each
person to fight against which was to fight against the heavens
themselves that he as a brother of the Rose was bound to believe
nay to assert at the swords point if need were that the incomparable
Rose of Torridge could make none but a worthy and virtuous choice and
that to the man whom she had honored by her affection was due on their
part Spaniard and Papist though he might be all friendship worship
and loyal faith for evermore

And honest Will took it all for gospel little dreaming what agony of
despair what fearful suspicions what bitter prayers this letter had
cost to the gentle heart of Francis Leigh

He showed the letter triumphantly to St Leger and he was quite wise
enough to gainsay no word of it at least aloud but quite wise enough
also to believe in secret that Frank looked on the matter in quite a
different light however he contented himself with saying

The man is an angel as his mother is and there the matter dropped for
a few days till one came forward who had no mind to let it drop and
that was Jack Brimblecombe now curate of Hartland town and passing
rich on forty pounds a year

I hope no offence Mr William but when are you and the rest going
afterafter her The name stuck in his throat

Cary was taken aback

Whats that to thee Catiline the blooddrinker asked he trying to
laugh it off

What Dont laugh at me sir for its no laughing matter I drank
that night naught worse I expect than red wine Whatever it was we
swore our oaths Mr Cary and oaths are oaths say I

Of course Jack of course but to go to look for herand when weve
found her cut her lovers throat Absurd Jack even if she were worth
looking for or his throat worth cutting Tut tut tut

But Jack looked steadfastly in his face and after some silence

How far is it to the Caracas then sir

What is that to thee man

Why he was made governor thereof I hear so that would be the place
to find her

You dont mean to go thither to seek her shouted Cary forcing a
laugh

That depends on whether I can go sir but if I can scrape the money
together or get a berth on board some ship why Gods will must be
done

Will looked at him to see if he had been drinking or gone mad but the
little pigs eyes were both sane and sober

Will knew no answer To laugh at the poor fellow was easy enough to
deny that he was right that he was a hero and cavalier outdoing
romance itself in faithfulness not so easy and Cary in the first
impulse wished him at the bottom of the bay for shaming him Of
course his own plan of letting ill alone was the rational prudent
irreproachable plan and just what any gentleman in his senses would
have done but here was a vulgar fat curate out of his senses
determined not to let ill alone but to do something as Cary felt in
his heart of a far diviner stamp

Well said Jack in his stupid steadfast way its a very bad
lookout but mothers pretty well off if father dies and the maidens
are stout wenches enough and will make tidy servants please the Lord
And youll see that they come to no harm Mr William for old
acquaintance sake if I never come back

Cary was silent with amazement

And Mr William you know me for an honest man I hope Will you lend
me a five pound and take my books in pawn for them just to help me
out

Are you mad or in a dream You will never find her

Thats no reason why I shouldnt do my duty in looking for her Mr
William

But my good fellow even if you get to the Indies you will be clapt
into the Inquisition and burnt alive as sure as your name is Jack

I know that said he in a doleful tone and a sore struggle of the
flesh I have had about it for I am a great coward Mr William a dirty
coward and always was as you know but maybe the Lord will take care
of me as He does of little children and drunken men and if not Mr
Will Id sooner burn and have it over than go on this way any longer
I would and Jack burst out blubbering

What way my dear old lad said Will softened as he well might be

Why notnot to know whetherwhetherwhether shes married to him or
nother that I looked up to as an angel of God as pure as the light of
day and knew she was too good for a poor pothead like me and prayed
for her every night God knows that she might marry a king if there
was one fit for herand I not to know whether shes living in sin or
not Mr WilliamIts more than I can bear and theres an end of it
And if she is married to him they keep no faith with heretics they can
dissolve the marriage or make away with her into the Inquisition burn
her Mr Cary as soon as burn me the devils incarnate

Cary shuddered the fact true and palpable as it was had never struck
him before

Yes or make her deny her God by torments if she hasnt done it
already for love to thatI know how love will make a body sell his
soul for Ive been in love Dont you laugh at me Mr Will or I
shall go mad

God knows I was never less inclined to laugh at you in my life my
brave old Jack

Is it so then Bless you for that word and Jack held out his hand
But what will become of my soul after my oath if I dont seek her
out just to speak to her to warn her for Gods sake even if it did
no good just to set before her the Lords curse on idolatry and
Antichrist and those who deny Him for the sake of any creature though
I cant think he would be hard on herfor who could But I must speak
all the same The Lord has laid the burden on me and done it must be
God help me

Jack said Cary if this is your duty it is others

No sir I dont say that youre a layman but I am a deacon and the
chaplain of you all and sworn to seek out Christs sheep scattered up
and down this naughty world and that innocent lamb first of all

You have sheep at Hartland Jack already

Theres plenty better than I will tend them when I am gone but none
that will tend her because none love her like me and they wont
venture Who will It cant be expected and no shame to them

I wonder what Amyas Leigh would say to all this if he were at home

Say Hed do He isnt one for talking Hed go through fire and
water for her you trust him Will Cary and call me an ass if he
wont

Will you wait then till he comes back and ask him

He may not be back for a year and more

Hear reason Jack If you will wait like a rational and patient man
instead of rushing blindfold on your ruin something may be done

You think so

I cannot promise but

But promise me one thing Do you tell Mr Frank what I sayor rather
Ill warrant if I knew the truth he has said the very same thing
himself already

You are out there old man for here is his own handwriting

Jack read the letter and sighed bitterly Well I did take him for
another guess sort of fine gentleman Still if my duty isnt his its
mine all the same I judge no man but I go Mr Cary

But go you shall not till Amyas returns As I live I will tell your
father Jack unless you promise and you dare not disobey him

I dont know even that for conscience sake said Jack doubtfully

At least you stay and dine here old fellow and we will settle
whether you are to break the fifth commandment or not over good brewed
sack

Now a good dinner was as we know what Jack loved and loved too oft in
vain so he submitted for the nonce and Cary thought ere he went that
he had talked him pretty well round At least he went home and was
seen no more for a week

But at the end of that time he returned and said with a joyful voice

I have settled all Mr Will The parson of Welcombe will serve my
church for two Sundays and I am away for London town to speak to Mr
Frank

To London How wilt get there

On Shanks his mare said Jack pointing to his bandy legs But I
expect I can get a lift on board of a coaster so far as Bristol and
its no way on to signify I hear

Cary tried in vain to dissuade him and then forced on him a small loan
with which away went Jack and Cary heard no more of him for three
weeks

At last he walked into Clovelly Court again just before suppertime
thin and legweary and sat himself down among the servingmen till Will
appeared

Will took him up above the salt and made much of him which indeed the
honest fellow much needed and after supper asked him in private how he
had sped

I have learnt a lesson Mr William Ive learnt that there is one on
earth loves her better than I if she had but had the wit to have taken
him

But what says he of going to seek her

He says what I say Go and he says what you say Wait

Go Impossible How can that agree with his letter

Thats no concern of mine Of course being nearer heaven than I am
he sees clearer what he should say and do than I can see for him Oh
Mr Will thats not a man hes an angel of God but hes dying Mr
Will

Dying

Yes faith of love for her I can see it in his eyes and hear it in
his voice but I am of tougher hide and stiffer clay and so you see I
cant die even if I tried But Ill obey my betters and wait

And so Jack went home to his parish that very evening weary as he was
in spite of all entreaties to pass the night at Clovelly But he had
left behind him thoughts in Carys mind which gave their owner no rest
by day or night till the touch of a seeming accident made them all
start suddenly into shape as a touch of the freezing water covers it in
an instant with crystals of ice

He was lounging so he told Amyas one murky day on Bideford quay when
up came Mr Salterne Cary had shunned him of late partly from
delicacy partly from dislike of his supposed hardheartedness But
this time they happened to meet full and Cary could not pass without
speaking to him

Well Mr Salterne and how goes on the shipping trade

Well enough sir if some of you young gentlemen would but follow Mr
Leighs example and go forth to find us stayathomes new markets for
our ware

What you want to be rid of us eh

I dont know why I should sir We shant cross each other now sir
whatever might have been once But if I were you I should be in the
Indies about now if I were not fighting the queens battles nearer
home

In the Indies I should make but a poor hand of Drakes trade And so
the conversation dropped but Cary did not forget the hint

So lad to make an end of a long story said he to Amyas if you are
minded to take the old mans offer so am I and Westwardho with you
come foul come fair

It will be but a wildgoose chase Will

If she is with him we shall find her at La Guayra If she is not and
the villain has cast her off down the wind that will be only an
additional reason for making an example of him

And if neither of them are there Will the Platefleets will be so it
will be our own shame if we come home emptyhanded But will your
father let you run such a risk

My father said Cary laughing He has just now so good hope of a
long string of little Carys to fill my place that he will be in no lack
of an heir come what will

Little Carys

I tell you truth I think he must have had a sly sup of that fountain
of perpetual youth which our friend Don Guzmans grandfather went to
seek in Florida for some twelvemonth since he must needs marry a
tenants buxom daughter and Mistress Abishag Jewell has brought him one
fat baby already So I shall go back to Ireland or with you but
somewhere I cant abide the things squalling any more than I can
seeing Mistress Abishag sitting in my poor dear mothers place and
informing me every other day that she is come of an illustrious house
because she is or is not third cousin seven times removed to my
fathers old friend Bishop Jewell of glorious memory I had
threeparts of a quarrel with the dear old man the other day for after
one of her peacockbouts I couldnt for the life of me help saying
that as the Bishop had written an Apology for the people of England my
father had better conjure up his ghost to write an apology for him and
head it Why green heads should grow on gray shoulders

You impudent villain And what did he say

Laughed till he cried again and told me if I did not like it I might
leave it which is just what I intend to do Only mind if we go we
must needs take Jack Brimblecombe with us or he will surely heave
himself over Harty Point and his ghost will haunt us to our dying day

Jack shall go None deserves it better

After which there was a long consultation on practical matters and it
was concluded that Amyas should go up to London and sound Frank and his
mother before any further steps were taken The other brethren of the
Rose were scattered far and wide each at his post and St Leger had
returned to his uncle so that it would be unfair to them as well as a
considerable delay to demand of them any fulfilment of their vow
And as Amyas sagely remarked Too many cooks spoil the broth and
halfadozen gentlemen aboard one ship are as bad as two kings of
Brentford

With which maxim he departed next morning for London leaving Yeo with
Cary



CHAPTER XVI

THE MOST CHIVALROUS ADVENTURE OF THE GOOD SHIP ROSE

 He is brass within and steel without
 With beams on his topcastle strong
 And eighteen pieces of ordinance
 He carries on either side along

 Sir Andrew Barton

Let us take boat as Amyas did at Whitehallstairs and slip down ahead
of him under old London Bridge and so to Deptford Creek where remains
as it were embalmed the famous ship Pelican in which Drake had sailed
round the world There she stands drawn up high and dry upon the sedgy
bank of Thames like an old warrior resting after his toil Nailed upon
her mainmast are epigrams and verses in honor of her and of her captain
three of which by the Winchester scholar Camden gives in his History
and Elizabeths self consecrated her solemnly and having banqueted on
board there and then honored Drake with the dignity of knighthood At
which time a bridge of planks by which they came on board broke under
the press of people and fell down with a hundred men upon it who
notwithstanding had none of them any harm So as that ship may seem to
have been built under a lucky planet

There she has remained since as a show and moreover as a sort of
dininghall for jovial parties from the city one of which would seem
to be on board this afternoon to judge from the flags which bedizen the
masts the sounds of revelry and savory steams which issue from those
windows which once were portholes and the rushing to and fro along the
river brink and across that lucky bridge of whiteaproned waiters from
the neighboring Pelican Inn A great feast is evidently toward for
with those whiteaproned waiters are gay serving men wearing on their
shoulders the citybadge The lord mayor is giving a dinner to certain
gentlemen of the Leicester house party who are interested in foreign
discoveries and what place so fit for such a feast as the Pelican
itself

Look at the men all round a nobler company you will seldom see
Especially too if you be Americans look at their faces and reverence
them for to them and to their wisdom you owe the existence of your
mighty fatherland

At the head of the table sits the lord mayor whom all readers will
recognize at once for he is none other than that famous Sir Edward
Osborne clothworker and ancestor of the dukes of Leeds whose romance
nowadays is in every ones hands He is aged but not changed since
he leaped from the window upon London Bridge into the roaring tide
below to rescue the infant who is now his wife The chivalry and
promptitude of the prentice boy have grown and hardened into the
thoughtful daring of the wealthy merchant adventurer There he sits a
right kingly man with my lord Earl of Cumberland on his right hand and
Walter Raleigh on his left the three talk together in a low voice on
the chance of there being vast and rich countries still undiscovered
between Florida and the River of Canada Raleighs halfscientific
declamation and his often quotations of Doctor Dee the conjuror have
less effect on Osborne than on Cumberland who tried many an adventure
to foreign parts and failed in all of them apparently for the simple
reason that instead of going himself he sent other people and
Raleigh is fain to call to his help the quiet student who sits on his
left hand Richard Hakluyt of Oxford But he is deep in talk with a
reverend elder whose long white beard flows almost to his waist and
whose face is furrowed by a thousand storms Anthony Jenkinson by name
the great Asiatic traveller who is discoursing to the Christchurch
virtuoso of reindeer sledges and Siberian steppes and of the fossil
ivory plain proof of Noahs flood which the Tungoos dig from the
icecliffs of the Arctic sea Next to him is Christopher Carlile
Walsinghams soninlaw as Sidney also is now a valiant captain
afterwards general of the soldiery in Drakes triumphant West Indian
raid of 1585 with whom a certain Bishop of Carthagena will hereafter
drink good wine He is now busy talking with Alderman Hart the
grocer Sheriff Spencer the clothworker and Charles Leigh Amyass
merchantcousin and with Aldworth the mayor of Bristol and William
Salterne alderman thereof and cousin of our friend at Bideford For
Carlile and Secretary Walsingham also have been helping them heart
and soul for the last two years to collect money for Humphrey and Adrian
Gilberts great adventures to the NorthWest on one of which Carlile
was indeed to have sailed himself but did not go after all I never
could discover for what reason

On the opposite side of the table is a group scarcely less interesting
Martin Frobisher and John Davis the pioneers of the NorthWest passage
are talking with Alderman Sanderson the great geographer and setter
forth of globes with Mr Towerson Sir Gilbert Peckham our old
acquaintance Captain John Winter and last but not least with Philip
Sidney himself who with his accustomed courtesy has given up his
rightful place toward the head of the table that he may have a knot of
virtuosi all to himself and has brought with him of course his two
especial intimates Mr Edward Dyer and Mr Francis Leigh They too are
talking of the NorthWest passage and Sidney is lamenting that he is
tied to diplomacy and courts and expressing his envy of old Martin
Frobisher in all sorts of pretty compliments to which the other replies
that

Its all very fine to talk of here a sailing on dry land with a
good glass of wine before you but youd find it another guess sort of
business knocking about among the icebergs with your beard frozen fast
to your ruff Sir Philip specially if you were a bit squeamish about
the stomach

That were a slight matter to endure my dear sir if by it I could win
the honor which her majesty bestowed on you when her own ivory hand
waved a farewell kerchief to your ship from the windows of Greenwich
Palace

Well sir folks say you have no reason to complain of lack of favors
as you have no reason to deserve lack and if you can get them by
staying ashore dont you go to sea to look for more say I Eh Master
Towerson

Towersons gray beard which has stood many a foreign voyage both fair
and foul wags grim assent But at this moment a Waiter enters and

Please my lord mayors worship there is a tall gentleman outside
would speak with the Right Honorable Sir Walter Raleigh

Show him in man Sir Walters friends are ours

Amyas enters and stands hesitating in the doorway

Captain Leigh cry half adozen voices

Why did you not walk in sir says Osborne You should know your way
well enough between these decks

Well enough my lords and gentlemen But Sir Walteryou will excuse
meand he gave Raleigh a look which was enough for his quick wit
Turning pale as death he rose and followed Amyas into an adjoining
cabin They were five minutes together and then Amyas came out alone

In few words he told the company the sad story which we already know
Ere it was ended noble tears were glistening on some of those stern
faces

The old Egyptians said Sir Edward Osborne when they banqueted set
a corpse among their guests for a memorial of human vanity Have we
forgotten God and our own weakness in this our feast that He Himself
has sent us thus a message from the dead

Nay my lord mayor said Sidney not from the dead but from the
realm of everlasting life

Amen answered Osborne But gentlemen our feast is at an end There
are those here who would drink on merrily as brave men should in spite
of the private losses of which they have just had news but none here
who can drink with the loss of so great a man still ringing in his
ears

It was true Though many of the guests had suffered severely by the
failure of the expedition they had utterly forgotten that fact in the
awful news of Sir Humphreys death and the feast broke up sadly and
hurriedly while each man asked his neighbor What will the queen say

Raleigh reentered in a few minutes but was silent and pressing many
an honest hand as he passed went out to call a wherry beckoning Amyas
to follow him Sidney Cumberland and Frank went with them in another
boat leaving the two to talk over the sad details

They disembarked at Whitehallstairs Raleigh Sidney and Cumberland
went to the palace and the two brothers to their mothers lodgings

Amyas had prepared his speech to Frank about Rose Salterne but now that
it was come to the point he had not courage to begin and longed that
Frank would open the matter Frank too shrank from what he knew must
come and all the more because he was ignorant that Amyas had been to
Bideford or knew aught of the Roses disappearance

So they went upstairs and it was a relief to both of them to find that
their mother was at the Abbey for it was for her sake that both dreaded
what was coming So they went and stood in the baywindow which looked
out upon the river and talked of things indifferent and looked
earnestly at each others faces by the fading light for it was now
three years since they had met

Years and events had deepened the contrast between the two brothers and
Frank smiled with affectionate pride as he looked up in Amyass face
and saw that he was no longer merely the rollicking handy sailorlad
but the selfconfident and stately warrior showing in every look and
gesture

 The reason firm the temperate will
 Endurance foresight strength and skill

worthy of one whose education had been begun by such men as Drake and
Grenville and finished by such as Raleigh and Gilbert His long locks
were now cropped close to the head but as a setoff the lips and chin
were covered with rich golden beard his face was browned by a thousand
suns and storms a long scar the trophy of some Irish fight crossed
his right temple his huge figure had gained breadth in proportion to
its height and his hand as it lay upon the windowsill was hard and
massive as a smiths Frank laid his own upon it and sighed and Amyas
looked down and started at the contrast between the twoso slender
bloodless all but transparent were the delicate fingers of the
courtier Amyas looked anxiously into his brothers face It was
changed indeed since they last met The brilliant red was still on
either cheek but the white had become dull and opaque the lips were
pale the features sharpened the eyes glittered with unnatural fire
and when Frank told Amyas that he looked aged Amyas could not help
thinking that the remark was far more true of the speaker himself

Trying to shut his eyes to the palpable truth he went on with his chat
asking the names of one building after another

And so this is old Father Thames with his bank of palaces

Yes His banks are stately enough yet you see he cannot stay to look
at them He hurries down to the sea and the sea into the ocean and the
ocean Westwardho forever All things move Westwardho Perhaps we may
move that way ourselves some day Amyas

What do you mean by that strange talk

Only that the ocean follows the primum mobile of the heavens and flows
forever from east to west Is there anything so strange in my thinking
of that when I am just come from a party where we have been drinking
success to Westwardho

And much good has come of it I have lost the best friend and the
noblest captain upon earth not to mention all my little earnings in
that same confounded gulf of Westwardho

Yes Sir Humphrey Gilberts star has set in the Westwhy not Sun
moon and planets sink into the West why not the meteors of this lower
world why not a willothewisp like me Amyas

God forbid Frank

Why then Is not the West the land of peace and the land of dreams
Do not our hearts tell us so each time we look upon the setting sun and
long to float away with him upon the goldencushioned clouds They bury
men with their faces to the East I should rather have mine turned
to the West Amyas when I die for I cannot but think it some divine
instinct which made the ancient poets guess that Elysium lay beneath the
setting sun It is bound up in the heart of man that longing for the
West I complain of no one for fleeing away thither beyond the utmost
sea as David wished to flee and be at peace

Complain of no one for fleeing thither asked Amyas That is more
than I do

Frank looked inquiringly at him and then

No If I had complained of any one it would have been of you just now
for seeming to be tired of going Westwardho

Do you wish me to go then

God knows said Frank after a moments pause But I must tell you
now I suppose once and for all That has happened at Bideford which

Spare us both Frank I know all I came through Bideford on my way
hither and came hither not merely to see you and my mother but to ask
your advice and her permission

True heart noble heart cried Frank I knew you would be stanch

Westwardho it is then

Can we escape

We

Amyas does not that which binds you bind me

Amyas started back and held Frank by the shoulders at arms length as
he did so he could feel through that his brothers arms were but skin
and bone

You Dearest man a month of it would kill you

Frank smiled and tossed his head on one side in his pretty way

I belong to the school of Thales who held that the ocean is the mother
of all life and feel no more repugnance at returning to her bosom again
than Humphrey Gilbert did

But Frankmy mother

My mother knows all and would not have us unworthy of her

Impossible She will never give you up

All things are possible to them that believe in God my brother and
she believes But indeed Doctor Dee the wise man gave her but this
summer I know not what of prognostics and diagnostics concerning me I
am born it seems under a cold and watery planet and need if I am to
be longlived to go nearer to the vivifying heat of the sun and there
bask out my little life like fly on wall To tell truth he has bidden
me spend no more winters here in the East but return to our native
seabreezes there to warm my frozen lungs and has so filled my
mothers fancy with stories of sick men who were given up for lost in
Germany and France and yet renewed their youth like any serpent or
eagle by going to Italy Spain and the Canaries that she herself will
be more ready to let me go than I to leave her all alone And yet I must
go Amyas It is not merely that my heart pants as Sidneys does as
every gallants ought to make one of your noble choir of Argonauts
who are now replenishing the earth and subduing it for God and for the
queen it is not merely Amyas that love calls melove tyrannous and
uncontrollable strengthened by absence and deepened by despair but
honor Amyasmy oath

And he paused for lack of breath and bursting into a violent fit of
coughing leaned on his brothers shoulder while Amyas cried

Fools fools that we werethat I was I meanto take that fantastical
vow

Not so answered a gentle voice from behind you vowed for the
sake of peace on earth and goodwill toward men and Blessed are the
peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God No my sons
be sure that such selfsacrifice as you have shown will meet its full
reward at the hand of Him who sacrificed Himself for you

Oh mother mother said Amyas and do you not hate the very sight of
mecome here to take away your firstborn

My boy God takes him and not you And if I dare believe in such
predictions Doctor Dee assured me that some exceeding honor awaited you
both in the West to each of you according to your deserts

Ah said Amyas My blessing I suppose will be like Esaus to live
by my sword while Jacob here the spiritual man inherits the kingdom
of heaven and an angels crown

Be it what it may it will surely be a blessing as long as you are
such my children as you have been At least my Frank will be safe from
the intrigues of court and the temptations of the world Would that I
too could go with you and share in your glory Come now said she
laying her head upon Amyass breast and looking up into his face with
one of her most winning smiles I have heard of heroic mothers ere
now who went forth with their sons to battle and cheered them on to
victory Why should I not go with you on a more peaceful errand I could
nurse the sick if there were any I could perhaps have speech of that
poor girl and win her back more easily than you She might listen to
words from a womana woman too who has lovedwhich she could not
hear from men At least I could mend and wash for you I suppose it is
as easy to play the good housewife afloat as on shore Come now

Amyas looked from one to the other

God only knows which of the two is less fit to go Mother mother you
know not what you ask Frank Frank I do not want you with me This
is a sterner matter than either of you fancy it to be one that must be
worked out not with kind words but with sharp shot and cold steel

How cried both together aghast

I must pay my men and pay my fellowadventurers and I must pay them
with Spanish gold And what is more I cannot as a loyal subject of
the queens go to the Spanish Main with a clear conscience on my own
private quarrel unless I do all the harm that my hand finds to do by
day and night to her enemies and the enemies of God

What nobler knighterrantry said Frank cheerfully but Mrs Leigh
shuddered

What Frank too she said half to herself but her sons knew what she
meant Amyass warlike life honorable and righteous as she knew it
to be she had borne as a sad necessity but that Frank as well should
become a man of blood was more than her gentle heart could face at
first sight That one youthful duel of his he had carefully concealed
from her knowing her feeling on such matters And it seemed too
dreadful to her to associate that gentle spirit with all the ferocities
and the carnage of a battlefield And yet said she to herself is
this but another of the selfwilled idols which I must renounce one by
one And then catching at a last hope she answered

Frank must at least ask the queens leave to go and if she permits
how can I gainsay her wisdom

And so the conversation dropped sadly enough

But now began a fresh perplexity in Franks soul which amused Amyas at
first when it seemed merely jest but nettled him a good deal when
he found it earnest For Frank looked forward to asking the queens
permission for his voyage with the most abject despondency and terror
Two or three days passed before he could make up his mind to ask for
an interview with her and he spent the time in making as much interest
with Leicester Hatton and Sidney as if he were about to sue for a
reprieve from the scaffold

So said Amyas remarking further that the queen could not cut his head
off for wanting to go to sea

But what axe so sharp as her frown said Frank in most lugubrious
tone

Amyas began to whistle in a very rude way

Ah my brother you cannot comprehend the pain of parting from her

No I cant I would die for the least hair of her royal head God
bless it but I could live very well from now till Doomsday without ever
setting eyes on the said head

Platos Troglodytes regretted not that sunlight which they had never
beheld

Amyas not understanding this recondite conceit made no answer to it
and there the matter ended for the time But at last Frank obtained his
audience and after a couple of hours absence returned quite pale and
exhausted

Thank Heaven it is over She was very angry at firstwhat else could
she beand upbraided me with having set my love so low I could only
answer that my fatal fault was committed before the sight of her had
taught me what was supremely lovely and only worthy of admiration Then
she accused me of disloyalty in having taken an oath which bound me to
the service of another than her I confessed my sin with tears and when
she threatened punishment pleaded that the offence had avenged itself
heavily alreadyfor what worse punishment than exile from the sunlight
of her presence into the outer darkness which reigns where she is not
Then she was pleased to ask me how I could dare as her sworn servant
to desert her side in such dangerous times as these and asked me how I
should reconcile it to my conscience if on my return I found her dead
by the assassins knife At which most pathetic demand I could only
throw myself at once on my own knees and her mercy and so awaited
my sentence Whereon with that angelic pity which alone makes her
awfulness endurable she turned to Hatton and asked What say you
Mouton Is he humbled sufficiently and so dismissed me

Heighho yawned Amyas

 If the bridge had been stronger
 My tale had been longer

Amyas Amyas quoth Frank solemnly you know not what power over the
soul has the native and Godgiven majesty of royalty awful enough in
itself when to it is superadded the wisdom of the sage and therewithal
the tenderness of the woman Had I my will there should be in every
realm not a salique but an antisalique law whereby no kings but only
queens should rule mankind Then would weakness and not power be to man
the symbol of divinity love and not cunning would be the arbiter of
every cause and chivalry not fear the spring of all obedience

Humph Theres some sense in that quoth Amyas Id run a mile for
a woman when I would not walk a yard for a man andWho is this our
mother is bringing in The handsomest fellow I ever saw in my life

Amyas was not far wrong for Mrs Leighs companion was none other than
Mr Secretary Amyass Smerwick Fort acquaintance alias Colin Clout
alias Immerito alias Edmund Spenser Some halfjesting conversation had
seemingly been passing between the poet and the saint for as they came
in she said with a smile which was somewhat of a forced oneWell
my dear sons you are sure of immortality at least on earth for Mr
Spenser has been vowing to me to give your adventure a whole canto to
itself in his Faerie Queene

And you no less madam said Spenser What were the story of the
Gracchi worth without the figure of Cornelia If I honor the fruit I
must not forget the stem which bears it Frank I congratulate you

Then you know the result of my interview mother

I know everything and am content said Mrs Leigh

Mrs Leigh has reason to be content said Spenser with that which is
but her own likeness

Spare your flattery to an old woman Mr Spenser When pray did I
with a most loving look at Frank refuse knighthood for dutys sake

Knighthood cried Amyas You never told me that Frank

That may well be Captain Leigh said Spenser but believe me her
majesty so Hatton assures me told him this day no less than that by
going on this quest he deprived himself of that highest earthly honor
which crowned heads are fain to seek from their own subjects

Spenser did not exaggerate Knighthood was then the prize of merit only
and one so valuable that Elizabeth herself said when asked why she did
not bestow a peerage upon some favorite that having already knighted
him she had nothing better to bestow It remained for young Essex to
begin the degradation of the order in his hapless Irish campaign and
for James to complete that degradation by his novel method of raising
money by the sale of baronetcies a new order of hereditary knighthood
which was the laughingstock of the day and which however venerable
it may have since become reflects anything but honor upon its first
possessors

I owe you no thanks Colin said Frank for having broached my
secret but I have lost nothing after all There is still an order of
knighthood in which I may win my spurs even though her majesty refuse
me the accolade

What then you will not take it from a foreign prince

Frank smiled

Have you never read of that knighthood which is eternal in the heavens
and of those true cavaliers whom John saw in Patmos riding on white
horses clothed in fine linen white and clean knightserrant in the
everlasting war against the False Prophet and the Beast Let me but
become worthy of their ranks hereafter what matter whether I be called
Sir Frank on earth

My son said Mrs Leigh remember that they follow One whose vesture
is dipped not in the blood of His enemies but in His own

I have remembered it for many a day and remembered too that the
garments of the knights may need the same tokens as their captains

Oh Frank Frank is not His precious blood enough to cleanse all sin
without the sacrifice of our own

We may need no more than His blood mother and yet He may need ours
said Frank

     

How that conversation ended I know not nor whether Spenser fulfilled
his purpose of introducing the two brothers and their mother into his
Faerie Queene If so the manuscripts must have been lost among those
which perished along with Spensers baby in the sack of Kilcolman by
the Irish in 1598 But we need hardly regret the loss of them for the
temper of the Leighs and their mother is the same which inspires every
canto of that noblest of poems and which inspired too hundreds in
those noble days when the chivalry of the Middle Ages was wedded to the
free thought and enterprise of the new

     

So mother and sons returned to Bideford and set to work Frank
mortgaged a farm Will Cary did the same having some land of his own
from his mother Old Salterne grumbled at any man save himself spending
a penny on the voyage and forced on the adventurers a good ship of two
hundred tons burden and five hundred pounds toward fitting her out
Mrs Leigh worked day and night at clothes and comforts of every kind
Amyas had nothing to give but his time and his brains but as Salterne
said the rest would have been of little use without them and day after
day he and the old merchant were on board the ship superintending
with their own eyes the fitting of every rope and nail Cary went about
beating up recruits and made with his jests and his frankness the
best of crimps while John Brimblecombe beside himself with joy
toddled about after him from tavern to tavern and quay to quay exalted
for the time being as Cary told him into a second Peter the Hermit
and so fiercely did he preach a crusade against the Spaniards through
Bideford and Appledore Clovelly and Ilfracombe that Amyas might have
had a hundred and fifty loose fellows in the first fortnight But he
knew better still smarting from the effects of a similar haste in the
Newfoundland adventure he had determined to take none but picked men
and by dint of labor he obtained them

Only one scapegrace did he take into his crew named Parracombe and
by that scapegrace hangs a tale He was an old schoolfellow of his
at Bideford and son of a merchant in that townone of those unlucky
members who are nobodys enemy but their owna handsome idle
clever fellow who used his scholarship of which he had picked up some
smattering chiefly to justify his own escapades and to string songs
together Having drunk all that he was worth at home he had in a
penitent fit forsworn liquor and tormented Amyas into taking him to
sea where he afterwards made as good a sailor as any one else
but sorely scandalized John Brimblecombe by all manner of heretical
arguments half Anacreontic half smacking of the rather loose doctrines
of that Family of Love which tormented the orthodoxy and morality of
more than one Bishop of Exeter Poor Will Parracombe he was born a few
centuries too early Had he but lived now he might have published
a volume or two of poetry and then settled down on the staff of a
newspaper Had he even lived thirty years later than he did he might
have written frantic tragedies or filthy comedies for the edification of
Jamess profligate metropolis and roistered it in taverns with Marlowe
to die as Marlowe did by a footmans sword in a drunken brawl But in
those stern days such weak and hysterical spirits had no fair vent for
their humors save in being reconciled to the Church of Rome and
plotting with Jesuits to assassinate the queen as Parry and Somerville
and many other madmen did

So at least some Jesuit or other seems to have thought shortly after
Amyas had agreed to give the spendthrift a berth on board For one day
Amyas going down to Appledore about his business was called into the
little Mariners Rest inn to extract therefrom poor Will Parracombe
who in spite of his vow was drunk and outrageous and had vowed the
death of the landlady and all her kin So Amyas fetched him out by the
collar and walked him home thereby to Bideford during which walk Will
told him a long and confused story how an Egyptian rogue had met him
that morning on the sands by Boathythe offered to tell his fortune
and prophesied to him great wealth and honor but not from the Queen of
England had coaxed him to the Mariners Rest and gambled with him
for liquor at which it seemed Will always won and of course drank his
winnings on the spot whereon the Egyptian began asking him all sorts of
questions about the projected voyage of the Rosea good many of which
Will confessed he had answered before he saw the fellows drift
after which the Egyptian had offered him a vast sum of money to do some
desperate villainy but whether it was to murder Amyas or the queen
whether to bore a hole in the bottom of the good ship Rose or to set the
Torridge on fire by artmagic he was too drunk to recollect exactly
Whereon Amyas treated threequarters of the story as a tipsy dream
and contented himself by getting a warrant against the landlady for
harboring Egyptians which was then a heavy offencea gipsy disguise
being a favorite one with Jesuits and their emissaries She of course
denied that any gipsy had been there and though there were some who
thought they had seen such a man come in none had seen him go out
again On which Amyas took occasion to ask what had become of the
suspicious Popish ostler whom he had seen at the Mariners Rest three
years before and discovered to his surprise that the said ostler
had vanished from the very day of Don Guzmans departure from Bideford
There was evidently a mystery somewhere but nothing could be proved
the landlady was dismissed with a reprimand and Amyas soon forgot the
whole matter after rating Parracombe soundly After all he could not
have told the gipsy if one existed anything important for the special
destination of the voyage as was the custom in those times for fear of
Jesuits playing into the hands of Spain had been carefully kept secret
among the adventurers themselves and except Yeo and Drew none of the
men had any suspicion that La Guayra was to be their aim

And Salvation Yeo

Salvation was almost wild for a few days at the sudden prospect of
going in search of his little maid and of fighting Spaniards once more
before he died I will not quote the texts out of Isaiah and the Psalms
with which his mouth was filled from morning to night for fear of
seeming irreverent in the eyes of a generation which does not believe
as Yeo believed that fighting the Spaniards was as really fighting in
Gods battle against evil as were the wars of Joshua or David But the
old man had his practical hint too and entreated to be sent back to
Plymouth to look for men

Theres many a man of the old Pelican sir and of Captain Hawkinss
Minion that knows the Indies as well as I and longs to be back again
Theres Drew sir that we left behind and no better sailingmaster for
us in the Westcountry and has accounts against the Spaniards too for
it was his brother the Barnstaple man that was factor aboard of poor
Mr Andrew Barker and got clapt into the Inquisition at the Canaries
you promised him sir that night he stood by you on board the Raleigh
and if youll be as good as your word hell be as good as his and
bring a score more brave fellows with him

So off went Yeo to Plymouth and returned with Drew and a score of old
neverstrikes One look at their visages as Yeo proudly ushered them
into the Ship Tavern showed Amyas that they were of the metal which he
wanted and that with the four NorthDevon men who had gone round the
world with him in the Pelican who all joined in the first week he had
a reserveforce on which he could depend in utter need and that utter
need might come he knew as well as any

Nor was this all which Yeo had brought for he had with him a letter
from Sir Francis Drake full of regrets that he had not seen his dear
lad as he went through Plymouth But indeed I was up to Dartmoor
surveying with crossstaff and chain over my knees in bog for a three
weeks or more For I have a project to bring down a leat of fair water
from the hilltops right into Plymouth town cutting off the heads
of Tavy Meavy Wallcomb and West Dart and thereby purging Plymouth
harbor from the silt of the mines whereby it has been choked of late
years and giving pure drink not only to the townsmen but to the fleets
of the queens majesty which if I do I shall both make some poor
return to God for all His unspeakable mercies and erect unto myself a
monument better than of brass or marble not merely honorable to me but
useful to my countrymen Whereon Frank sent Drake a pretty epigram
comparing Drakes projected leat to that river of eternal life whereof
the just would drink throughout eternity and quoting after the fashion
of those days John vii 38 while Amyas took more heed of a practical
appendage to the same letter which was a list of hints scrawled for
his use by Captain John Hawkins himself on all sea matters from
the mounting of ordnance to the use of vitriol against the scurvy in
default of oranges and limmons all which stood Amyas in good stead
during the ensuing month while Frank grew more and more proud of his
brother and more and more humble about himself

  This noble monument of Drakes piety and public spirit
 still remains in full use

For he watched with astonishment how the simple sailor without genius
scholarship or fancy had gained by plain honesty patience and
common sense a power over the human heart and a power over his work
whatsoever it might be which Frank could only admire afar off The men
looked up to him as infallible prided themselves on forestalling his
wishes carried out his slightest hint worked early and late to win
a smile from him while as for him no detail escaped him no drudgery
sickened him no disappointment angered him till on the 15th of
November 1583 dropped down from Bideford Quay to Appledore Pool the
tall ship Rose with a hundred men on board for sailors packed close
in those days beef pork biscuit and good ale for ale went to sea
always then in abundance four culverins on her main deck her poop and
forecastle well fitted with swivels of every size and her racks so full
of muskets calivers long bows pikes and swords that all agreed so
wellappointed a ship had never sailed out over Bar

The next day being Sunday the whole crew received the Communion
together at Northam Church amid a mighty crowd and then going on board
again hove anchor and sailed out over the Bar before a soft east wind
to the music of sacbut fife and drum with discharge of all ordnance
great and small with cheering of young and old from cliff and strand
and quay and with many a tearful prayer and blessing upon that gallant
bark and all brave hearts on board

And Mrs Leigh who had kissed her sons for the last time after the
Communion at the altarsteps and what more fit place for a mothers
kiss went to the rocky knoll outside the churchyard wall and watched
the ship glide out between the yellow denes and lessen slowly hour by
hour into the boundless West till her hull sank below the dim horizon
and her white sails faded away into the gray Atlantic mist perhaps
forever

And Mrs Leigh gathered her cloak about her and bowed her head and
worshipped and then went home to loneliness and prayer



CHAPTER XVII

HOW THEY CAME TO BARBADOS AND FOUND NO MEN THEREIN

 The suns rim dips the stars rush out
 At one stride comes the dark

 COLERIDGE

Land land land Yes there it was far away to the south and west
beside the setting sun a long blue bar between the crimson sea and
golden sky Land at last with fresh streams and cooling fruits and
free room for cramped and scurvyweakened limbs And there too might
be gold and gems and all the wealth of Ind Who knew Why not The old
world of fact and prose lay thousands of miles behind them and before
them and around them was the realm of wonder and fable of boundless
hope and possibility Sick men crawled up out of their stifling
hammocks strong men fell on their knees and gave God thanks and all
eyes and hands were stretched eagerly toward the far blue cloud fading
as the sun sank down yet rising higher and broader as the ship rushed
on before the rich tradewind which whispered lovingly round brow
and sail I am the faithful friend of those who dare Blow freshly
freshlier yet thou good tradewind of whom it is written that He makes
the winds His angels ministering breaths to the heirs of His salvation
Blow freshlier yet and save if not me from death yet her from worse
than death Blow on and land me at her feet to call the lost lamb
home and die

So murmured Frank to himself as with straining eyes he gazed upon that
first outlier of the New World which held his all His cheeks were thin
and wasted and the hectic spot on each glowed crimson in the crimson
light of the setting sun A few minutes more and the rainbows of the
West were gone emerald and topaz amethyst and ruby had faded into
silvergray and overhead through the dark sapphire depths the Moon
and Venus reigned above the sea

That should be Barbados your worship said Drew the master unless
my reckoning is far out which Heaven knows it has no right to be
after such a passage and God be praised

Barbados I never heard of it

Very like sir but Yeo and I were here with Captain Drake and I was
here after too with poor Captain Barlow and there is good harborage
to the south and west of it I remember

And neither Spaniard cannibal or other evil beast said Yeo A very
garden of the Lord sir hid away in the seas for an inheritance to
those who love Him I heard Captain Drake talk of planting it if ever
he had a chance

I recollect now said Amyas some talk between him and poor Sir
Humphrey about an island here Would God he had gone thither instead of
to Newfoundland

Nay then said Yeo he is in bliss now with the Lord and you would
not have kept him from that sir

He would have waited as willingly as he went if he could have served
his queen thereby But what say you my masters How can we do better
than to spend a few days here to get our sick round before we make the
Main and set to our work

All approved the counsel except Frank who was silent

Come fellowadventurer said Cary we must have your voice too

To my impatience Will said he aside in a low voice there is but
one place on earth and I am all day longing for wings to fly thither
but the counsel is right I approve it

So the verdict was announced and received with a hearty cheer by the
crew and long before morning they had run along the southern shore of
the island and were feeling their way into the bay where Bridgetown now
stands All eyes were eagerly fixed on the low wooded hills which slept
in the moonlight spangled by fireflies with a million dancing stars
all nostrils drank greedily the fragrant air which swept from the land
laden with the scent of a thousand flowers all ears welcomed as a
grateful change from the monotonous whisper and lap of the water the
hum of insects the snore of the treetoads the plaintive notes of the
shorefowl which fill a tropic night with noisy life

At last she stopped at last the cable rattled through the hawsehole
and then careless of the chance of lurking Spaniard or Carib an
instinctive cheer burst from every throat Poor fellows Amyas had much
ado to prevent them going on shore at once dark as it was by reminding
them that it wanted but two hours of day

Never were two such long hours said one young lad fidgeting up and
down

You never were in the Inquisition said Yeo or youd know better how
slow time can run Stand you still and give God thanks youre where you
are

I say Gunner be there goold to that island

Never heard of none and so much the better for it said Yeo dryly

But I say Gunner said a poor scurvystricken cripple licking his
lips be there oranges and limmons there

Not of my seeing but plenty of good fruit down to the beach thank the
Lord There comes the dawn at last

Up flushed the rose up rushed the sun and the level rays glittered on
the smooth stems of the palmtrees and threw rainbows across the foam
upon the coralreefs and gilded lonely uplands far away where now
stands many a stately countryseat and busy enginehouse Long lines of
pelicans went clanging out to sea the hum of the insects hushed and a
thousand birds burst into jubilant song a thin blue mist crept upward
toward the inner downs and vanished leaving them to quiver in the
burning glare the landbreeze which had blown fresh out to sea all
night died away into glassy calm and the tropic day was begun

The sick were lifted over the side and landed boatload after boatload
on the beach to stretch themselves in the shade of the palms and in
halfanhour the whole crew were scattered on the shore except some
dozen worthy men who had volunteered to keep watch and ward on board
till noon

And now the first instinctive cry of nature was for fruit fruit fruit
The poor lame wretches crawled from place to place plucking greedily the
violet grapes of the creeping shore vine and staining their mouths
and blistering their lips with the prickly pears in spite of Yeos
entreaties and warnings against the thorns Some of the healthy began
hewing down cocoanut trees to get at the nuts doing little thereby but
blunt their hatchets till Yeo and Drew having mustered halfadozen
reasonable men went off inland and returned in an hour laden with the
dainties of that primeval orchardwith acid junipaapples luscious
guavas and crowned ananas queen of all the fruits which they had
found by hundreds on the broiling ledges of the low tufacliffs
and then all sitting on the sandy turf defiant of galliwasps and
jackspaniards and all the weapons of the insect host partook of the
equal banquet while old blue landcrabs sat in their housedoors and
brandished their fists in defiance at the invaders and solemn cranes
stood in the water on the shoals with their heads on one side and
meditated how long it was since they had seen bipeds without feathers
breaking the solitude of their isle

And Frank wandered up and down silent but rather in wonder than
in sadness while great Amyas walked after him his mouth full
of junipaapples and enacted the part of showman with a sort of
patronizing air as one who had seen the wonders already and was above
being astonished at them

New new everything new said Frank meditatively Oh awful
feeling All things changed around us even to the tiniest fly and
flower yet we the same the same forever

Amyas to whom such utterances were altogether sibylline and
unintelligible answered by

Look Frank thats a colibri You ve heard of colibris

Frank looked at the living gem which hung loud humming over some
fantastic bloom and then dashed away seemingly to call its mate and
whirred and danced with it round and round the flowerstarred bushes
flashing fresh rainbows at every shifting of the lights

Frank watched solemnly awhile and then

Qualis Natura formatrix si talis formata Oh my God how fair must be
Thy real world if even Thy phantoms are so fair

Phantoms asked Amyas uneasily Thats no ghost Frank but a jolly
little honeysucker with a wee wife and children no bigger than peas
but yet solid greedy little fellows enough Ill warrant

Not phantoms in thy sense good fellow but in the sense of those who
know the worthlessness of all below

Ill tell you what brother Frank you are a great deal wiser than me
I know but I cant abide to see you turn up your nose as it were at
Gods good earth See now God made all these things and never a man
perhaps set eyes on them till fifty years agone and yet they were as
pretty as they are now ever since the making of the world And why
do you think God could have put them here then but to please
Himselfand Amyas took off his hatwith the sight of them Now I
say brother Frank whats good enough to please God is good enough to
please you and me

Your rebuke is just dear old simplehearted fellow and God forgive
me if with all my learning which has brought me no profit and my
longings which have brought me no peace I presume at moments sinner
that I am to be more dainty than the Lord Himself He walked in
Paradise among the trees of the garden Amyas and so will we and
be content with what He sends Why should we long for the next world
before we are fit even for this one

And in the meanwhile said Amyas this earths quite good enough at
least here in Barbados

Do you believe asked Frank trying to turn his own thoughts in
those tales of the Spaniards that the Sirens and Tritons are heard
singing in these seas

I cant tell Theres more fish in the water than ever came out of it
and more wonders in the world Ill warrant than we ever dreamt of but
I was never in these parts before and in the South Sea I must say I
never came across any though Yeo says he has heard fair music at night
up in the Gulf far away from land

The Spaniards report that at certain seasons choirs of these nymphs
assemble in the sea and with ravishing music sing their watery loves
It may be so For Nature which has peopled the land with rational
souls may not have left the sea altogether barren of them above all
when we remember that the ocean is as it were the very fount of all
fertility and its slime as the most learned hold with Thales of
Miletus that prima materia out of which all things were one by one
concocted Therefore the ancients feigned wisely that Venus the mother
of all living things whereby they designed the plastic force of nature
was born of the seafoam and rising from the deep floated ashore upon
the isles of Greece

I dont know what plastic force is but I wish I had had the luck to be
by when the pretty poppet came up however the nearest thing I ever saw
to that was maidens swimming alongside of us when we were in the South
Seas and would have come aboard too but Drake sent them all off again
for a lot of naughty packs and I verily believe they were no better
Look at the butterflies now Dont you wish you were a boy again and
not too proud to go catching them in your cap

And so the two wandered on together through the glorious tropic woods
and then returned to the beach to find the sick already grown cheerful
and many who that morning could not stir from their hammocks pacing up
and down and gaining strength with every step

Well done lads cried Amyas keep a cheerful mind We will have the
music ashore after dinner for want of mermaids to sing to us and those
that can dance may

And so those four days were spent and the men like schoolboys on
a holiday gave themselves up to simple merriment not forgetting
however to wash the clothes take in fresh water and store up a
good supply of such fruit as seemed likely to keep until tired with
fruitless rambles after gold which they expected to find in every bush
in spite of Yeos warnings that none had been heard of on the island
they were fain to lounge about fullgrown babies picking up shells and
seafans to take home to their sweethearts smoking agoutis out of the
hollow trees with shout and laughter and tormenting every living thing
they could come near till not a landcrab dare look out of his hole or
an armadillo unroll himself till they were safe out of the bay and
off again to the westward unconscious pioneers of all the wealth and
commerce and beauty and science which has in later centuries made that
lovely isle the richest gem of all the tropic seas



CHAPTER XVIII

HOW THEY TOOK THE PEARLS AT MARGARITA

 P Henry Why what a rascal art thou then to praise him so for
 running
 Falstaff O horseback ye cuckoo but afoot he will not budge a
 foot
 P Henry Yes Jack upon instinct
 Falstaff I grant ye upon instinct

 Henry IV Pt I

They had slipped past the southern point of Grenada in the night and
were at last within that fairy ring of islands on which nature had
concentrated all her beauty and man all his sin If Barbados had been
invested in the eyes of the newcomers with some strange glory how much
more the seas on which they now entered which smile in almost perpetual
calm untouched by the hurricane which roars past them far to northward
Sky sea and islands were one vast rainbow though little marked
perhaps by those sturdy practical sailors whose main thought was of
Spanish gold and pearls and as little by Amyas who accustomed to the
scenery of the tropics was speculating inwardly on the possibility of
extirpating the Spaniards and annexing the West Indies to the domains
of Queen Elizabeth And yet even their unpoetic eyes could not behold
without awe and excitement lands so famous and yet so new around
which all the wonder all the pity and all the greed of the age had
concentrated itself It was an awful thought and yet inspiriting that
they were entering regions all but unknown to Englishmen where the
penalty of failure would be worse than deaththe torments of the
Inquisition Not more than five times before perhaps had those
mysterious seas been visited by English keels but there were those
on board who knew them well and too well who first of all British
mariners had attempted under Captain John Hawkins to trade along those
very coasts and interdicted from the necessaries of life by Spanish
jealousy had in true English fashion won their markets at the swords
point and then bought and sold honestly and peaceably therein The old
mariners of the Pelican and the Minion were questioned all day long for
the names of every isle and cape every fish and bird while Frank stood
by listening serious and silent

A great awe seemed to have possessed his soul yet not a sad one for
his face seemed daily to drink in glory from the glory round him and
murmuring to himself at whiles This is the gate of heaven he stood
watching all day long careless of food and rest as every forward
plunge of the ship displayed some fresh wonder Islands and capes hung
high in air with their inverted images below them long sandhills
rolled and weltered in the mirage and the yellow flowerbeds and huge
thorny cacti like giant candelabra which clothed the glaring slopes
twisted tossed and flickered till the whole scene seemed one blazing
phantomworld in which everything was as unstable as it was fantastic
even to the sun itself distorted into strange oval and pearshaped
figures by the beds of crimson mist through which he sank to rest But
while Frank wondered Yeo rejoiced for to the southward of that setting
sun a cluster of tall peaks rose from the sea and they unless his
reckonings were wrong were the mountains of Macanao at the western end
of Margarita the Isle of Pearls then famous in all the cities of
the Mediterranean and at the great German fairs and second only in
richness to that pearl island in the gulf of Panama which fifteen years
before had cost John Oxenham his life

The next day saw them running along the north side of the island having
passed undiscovered as far as they could see the castle which the
Spaniards had built at the eastern end for the protection of the pearl
fisheries

At last they opened a deep and still bight wooded to the waters edge
and lying in the roadstead a caravel and three boats by her And at
that sight there was not a man but was on deck at once and not a mouth
but was giving its opinion of what should be done Some were for sailing
right into the roadstead the breeze blowing fresh toward the shore as
it usually does throughout those islands in the afternoon However
seeing the billows break here and there off the bays mouth they
thought it better for fear of rocks to run by quietly and then
send in the pinnace and the boat Yeo would have had them show Spanish
colors for fear of alarming the caravel but Amyas stoutly refused
counting it he said a mean thing to tell a lie in that way unless
in extreme danger or for great ends of state

So holding on their course till they were shut out by the next point
they started Cary in the largest boat with twenty men and Amyas in
the smaller one with fifteen more among whom was John Brimblecombe
who must needs come in his cassock and bands with an old sword of his
uncles which he prized mightily

When they came to the bights mouth they found as they had expected
coral rocks and too many of them so that they had to run along the
edge of the reef a long way before they could find a passage for the
boats While they were so doing and those of them who were new to the
Indies were admiring through the clear element those living flowerbeds
and subaqueous gardens of Nereus and Amphitrite there suddenly appeared
below what Yeo called a school of sharks some of them nearly as long
as the boat who looked up at them wistfully enough out of their wicked
scowling eyes

Jack said Amyas who sat next to him look how that big fellow
eyes thee he has surely taken a fancy to that plump hide of thine and
thinks thou wouldst eat as tender as any sucking porker

Jack turned very pale but said nothing

Now as it befell just then that very big fellow seeing a parrotfish
come out of a cleft of the coral made at him from below as did two or
three more the poor fish finding no other escape leaped clean into the
air and almost aboard the boat while just where he had come out of
the water three or four great brown shagreened noses clashed together
within two yards of Jack as he sat each showing its horrible rows of
saw teeth and then sank sulkily down again to watch for a fresh bait
At which Jack said very softly In manus tuas Domine and turning his
eyes in board had no lust to look at sharks any more

So having got through the reef in they ran with a fair breeze the
caravel not being now a musketshot off Cary laid her aboard before
the Spaniards had time to get to their ordnance and standing up in the
sternsheets shouted to them to yield The captain asked boldly enough
in whose name In the name of common sense ye dogs cries Will do
you not see that you are but fifty strong to our twenty Whereon up the
side he scrambled and the captain fired a pistol at him Cary knocked
him over unwilling to shed needless blood on which all the crew
yielded some falling on their knees some leaping overboard and the
prize was taken

In the meanwhile Amyas had pulled round under her stern and boarded
the boat which was second from her for the nearest was fast alongside
and so a sure prize The Spaniards in her yielded without a blow crying
Misericordia and the negroes leaping overboard swam ashore like
seadogs Meanwhile the third boat which was not an oars length
off turned to pull away Whereby befell a notable adventure for John
Brimblecombe casting about in a valiant mind how he should distinguish
himself that day must needs catch up a boathook and claw on to her
stern shouting Stay ye Papists Stay Spanish dogsby which as
was to be expected they being ten to his one he was forthwith pulled
overboard and fell all along on his nose in the sea leaving the hook
fast in her stern

Where I know not how being seized with some panic fear his lively
imagination filling all the sea with those sharks which he had just
seen he fell aroaring like any townbull and in his confusion never
thought to turn and get aboard again but struck out lustily after the
Spanish boat whether in hope of catching hold of the boathook which
trailed behind her or from a very madness of valor no man could
divine but on he swam his cassock afloat behind him looking for all
the world like a great black monkfish and howling and puffing with
his mouth full of salt water Stay ye Spanish dogs Help all good
fellows See you not that I am a dead man They are nuzzling already at
my toes He hath hold of my leg My right thigh is bitten clean off
Oh that I were preaching in Hartland pulpit Stay Spanish dogs Yield
Papist cowards least I make mincemeat of you and take me aboard
Yield I say or my blood be on your heads I am no Jonah if he swallow
me he will never cast me up again it is better to fall into the hands
of man than into the hands of devils with three rows of teeth apiece
In manus tuas Orate pro anima

And so forth in more frantic case than ever was Panurge in that his
evermemorable seasickness till the English expecting him every minute
to be snapped up by sharks or brained by the Spaniards oars let fly a
volley into the fugitives on which they all leaped overboard like their
fellows whereon Jack scrambled into the boat and drawing sword with
one hand while he wiped the water out of his eyes with the other began
to lay about him like a very lion cutting the empty air and crying
Yield idolaters Yield Spanish dogs However coming to himself
after a while and seeing that there was no one on whom to flesh his
maiden steel he sits down panting in the sternsheets and begins
stripping off his hose On which Amyas thinking surely that the good
fellow had gone mad with some stroke of the sun or by having fallen
into the sea after being overheated with his rowing bade pull
alongside and asked him in heavens name what he was doing with his
nether tackle On which Jack amid such laughter as may be conceived
vowed and swore that his right thigh was bitten clean through and to
the bone yea and that he felt his hose full of blood and so would
have swooned away for imaginary loss of blood so strong was the
delusion on him had not his friends after much arguing on their part
and anger on his persuaded him that he was whole and sound

After which they set to work to overhaul their maiden prize which they
found full of hides and saltpork and yet not of that alone for in
the captains cabin and also in the sternsheets of the boat which
Brimblecombe had so valorously boarded were certain frails of leaves
packed neatly enough which being opened were full of goodly pearls
though somewhat brown for the Spaniards used to damage the color in
their haste and greediness opening the shells by fire instead of
leaving them to decay gradually after the Arabian fashion with which
prize though they could not guess its value very exactly they went off
content enough after some malicious fellow had set the ship on fire
which being laden with hides was no nosegay as it burnt

Amyas was very angry at this wanton damage in which his model
Drake had never indulged but Cary had his jest ready Ah said he
Lutheran devils we are you know so we are bound to vanish like
other fiends with an evil savor

As soon however as Amyas was on board again he rounded his friend
Mr Brimblecombe in the ear and told him he had better play the man a
little more roaring less before he was hurt and keeping his breath
to help his strokes if he wished the crew to listen much to his
discourses Frank hearing this bade Amyas leave the offender to him
and so began upon him with

Come hither thou recreant Jack thou lilylivered Jack thou
hysterical Jack Tell me now thou hast read Platos Dialogues and
Aristotles Logic

To which Jack very meekly answered Yes

Then I will deal with thee after the manner of those ancient sages and
ask whether the greater must not contain the less

Jack Yes sure

Frank And that which is more than a part contain that part more than
which it is

Jack Yes sure

Frank Then tell me is not a priest more than a layman

Jack who was always very loud about the dignity of the priesthood
as many of his cloth are who have no other dignity whereon to stand
answered very boldly Of course

Frank Then a priest containeth a man and is a man and something
overviz his priesthood

Jack who saw whither this would lead I suppose so

Frank Then if a priest show himself no man he shows himself all the
more no priest

Ill tell you what Master Frank says Jack you may be right by
logic but sharks arent logic nor dont understand it neither

Frank Nay but my recalcitrant Jack my stiffnecked Jack is it the
part of a man to howl like a pig in a gate because he thinks that is
there which is not there

Jack had not a word to say

Frank And still more when if that had been there it had been the duty
of a brave man to have kept his mouth shut if only to keep salt water
out and not add the evil of choking to that of being eaten

Ah says Jack thats all very fine but you know as well as I that
it was not the Spaniards I was afraid of They were Heavens handiwork
and I knew how to deal with them but as for those fiends spawn of
sharks when I saw that fellow take the fish alongside it upset me
clean and theres an end of it

Frank Oh Jack Jack behold how one sin begets another Just now thou
wert but a coward and now thou art a Manichee For thou hast imputed
to an evil creator that which was formed only for a good end namely
sharks which were made on purpose to devour useless carcasses like
thine Moreover as a brother of the Rose thou wert bound by the vow of
thy brotherhood to have leaped joyfully down that sharks mouth

Jack Ay very likely if Mistress Rose had been in his stomach but I
wanted to fight Spaniards just then not to be sharkbitten

Frank Jack thy answer savors of selfwill If it is ordained that thou
shouldst advance the ends of the Brotherhood by being sharkbitten
or fleabitten or bitten by sharpers to the detriment of thy carnal
wealth or shortly to suffer any shame or torment whatsoever even to
strappado and scarpines thou art bound to obey thy destiny and not
after that vain Roman conceit to choose the manner of thine own death
which is indeed only another sort of selfmurder We therefore consider
thee as a cause of scandal and a rotten and creaking branch to be
excised by the spiritual arm and do hereby excise thee and cut thee
off

Jack Nay faith thats a little too much Master Frank How long have
you been Bishop of Exeter

Frank Jack thy wit being blinded and full of gross vapors by reason
of the perturbations of fear which like anger is a short madness
and raises in the phantasy vain spectresvidelicet of sharks and
Spaniards mistakes our lucidity For thy Manicheeism let his lordship
of Exeter deal with it For thy abominable howling and caterwauling
offensive in a chained cur but scandalous in a preacher and a brother
of the Rose we do hereby deprive thee of thine office of chaplain to
the Brotherhood and warn thee that unless within seven days thou do
some deed equal to the Seven Champions or Ruggiero and Orlandos self
thou shalt be deprived of sword and dagger and allowed henceforth to
carry no more iron about thee than will serve to mend thy pen

And now Jack said Amyas I will give thee a piece of news No
wonder that young men as the parsons complain so loudly will not
listen to the Gospel while it is preached to them by men on whom they
cannot but look down a set of softhanded fellows who cannot dig and
are ashamed to beg and as my brother has it must needs be parsons
before they are men

Frank Ay and even though we may excuse that in Popish priests and
friars who are vowed not to be men and get their bread shamefully
and rascally by telling sinners who owe a hundred measures to sit down
quickly and take their bill and write fifty yet for a priest of the
Church of England whose business is not merely to smuggle sinful souls
up the backstairs into heaven but to make men good Christians by making
them good men good gentlemen and good Englishmen to show the white
feather in the hour of need is to unpreach in one minute all that he
had been preaching his life long

I tell thee says Amyas if I had not taken thee for another guess
sort of man I had never let thee have the care of a hundred brave lads
immortal souls

And so on both of them boarding him at once with their heavy shot
larboard and starboard till he fairly clapped his hands to his ears
and ran for it leaving poor Frank laughing so heartily that Amyas was
after all glad the thing had happened for the sake of the smile which
it put into his sad and steadfast countenance

The next day was Sunday on which after divine service which they
could hardly persuade Jack to read so shamefaced was he and as for
preaching after it he would not hear of such a thing Amyas read
aloud according to custom the articles of their agreement and then
seeing abreast of them a sloping beach with a shoot of clear water
running into the sea agreed that they should land there wash the
clothes and again water the ship for they had found water somewhat
scarce at Barbados On this party Jack Brimblecombe must needs go
taking with him his sword and a great arquebuse for he had dreamed last
night he said that he was set upon by Spaniards and was sure that the
dream would come true and moreover that he did not very much care if
they did or if he ever got back alive for it was better to die than
be made an ape and a scarecrow and laughed at by the men and badgered
with Ramus his logic and Plato his dialectical devilries to confess
himself a Manichee and for aught he knew a turbaned Turk or Hebrew
Jew and so flung into the boat like a man desperate

So they went ashore after Amyas had given strict commands against
letting off firearms for fear of alarming the Spaniards There they
washed their clothes and stretched their legs with great joy admiring
the beauty of the place and then began to shoot the seine which they
had brought on shore with them In which says the chronicler we
caught many strange fishes and beside them a seacow full seven feet
long with limpets and barnacles on her back as if she had been a stick
of drifttimber This is a fond and foolish beast and yet pious withal
for finding a corpse she watches over it day and night until it decay
or be buried The Indians call her manati who carries her young
under her arm and gives it suck like a woman and being wounded she
lamenteth aloud with a human voice and is said at certain seasons to
sing very melodiously which melody perhaps having been heard in those
seas is that which Mr Frank reported to be the choirs of the Sirens
and Tritons The which I do not avouch for truth neither rashly deny
having seen myself such fertility of Natures wonders that I hold him
who denieth aught merely for its strangeness to be a ribald and an
ignoramus Also one of our men brought in two great black fowls which
he had shot with a crossbow bodied and headed like a capon but bigger
than any eagle which the Spaniards call curassos which with that
seacow afterwards made us good cheer both roast and sodden for the
cow was very dainty meat as good as a fourmonths calf and tender and
fat withal

After that they set to work filling the casks and barricos having laid
the boat up to the outflow of the rivulet And lucky for them it was
as it fell out that they were all close together at that work and not
abroad skylarking as they had been halfanhour before

Now John Brimblecombe had gone apart as soon as they landed with a
shamefaced and doleful countenance and sitting down under a great tree
plucked a Bible from his bosom and read steadfastly girded with his
great sword and his arquebuse lying by him This too was well for him
and for the rest for they had not yet finished their watering when
there was a cry that the enemy was on them and out of the wood
not twenty yards from the good parson came full fifty shot with a
multitude of negroes behind them and an officer in front on horseback
with a great plume of feathers in his hat and his sword drawn in his
hand

Stand for your lives shouted Amyas and only just in time for there
was ten good minutes lost in running up and down before he could get his
men into some order of battle But when Jack beheld the Spaniards as if
he had expected their coming he plucked a leaf and put it into the
page of his book for a mark laid the book down soberly caught up his
arquebuse ran like a mad dog right at the Spanish captain shot him
through the body stark dead and then flinging the arquebuse at the
head of him who stood next fell on with his sword like a very Colbrand
breaking in among the arquebuses and striking right and left such ugly
strokes that the Spaniards who thought him a very fiend or Luthers
self come to life to plague them gave back pellmell and shot at him
five or six at once with their arquebuses but whether from fear of him
or of wounding each other made so bad play with their pieces that he
only got one shrewd gall in his thigh which made him limp for many a
day But as fast as they gave back he came on and the rest by this time
ran up in good order and altogether nearly forty men well armed On
which the Spaniards turned and went as fast as they had come while
Cary hinted that The dogs had had such a taste of the parson that
they had no mind to wait for the clerk and people

Come back Jack are you mad shouted Amyas

But Jack who had not all this time spoken one word followed them
as fiercely as ever till reaching a great blow at one of the
arquebusiers he caught his foot in a root on which down he went and
striking his head against the ground knocked out of himself all the
breath he had left which between fatness and fighting was not much
and so lay Amyas seeing the Spaniards gone did not care to pursue
them but picked up Jack who staring about cried Glory be glory
beHow many have I killed How many have I killed

Nineteen at the least quoth Cary and seven with one back
stroke and then showed Brimblecombe the captain lying dead and two
arquebusiers one of which was the fugitive by whom he came to his fall
beside three or four more who were limping away wounded some of them by
their fellows shot

There said Jack pausing and blowing will you laugh at me any more
Mr Cary or say that I cannot fight because I am a poor parsons son

Cary took him by the hand and asked pardon of him for his scoffing
saying that he had that day played the best man of all of them and
Jack who never bore malice began laughing in his turn and

Oh Mr Cary we have all known your pleasant ways ever since you used
to put drumbledrones into my desk to Bideford school And so they went
to the boats and pulled off thanking God as they had need to do for
their great deliverance while all the boats crew rejoiced over Jack
who after a while grew very faint having bled a good deal without
knowing it and made as little of his real wound as he made much the
day before of his imaginary one

Frank asked him that evening how he came to show so cool and approved a
valor in so sudden a mishap

Well my masters said Jack I dont deny that I was very downcast on
account of what you said and the scandal which I had given to the crew
but as it happened I was reading there under the tree to fortify my
spirits the history of the ancient worthies in St Paul his eleventh
chapter to the Hebrews and just as I came to that out of weakness
were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies
of the aliens arose the cry of the Spaniards At which gentlemen
thinking in myself that I fought in just so good a cause as they and
as I hoped with like faith there came upon me so strange an assurance
of victory that I verily believed in myself that if there had been
a ten thousand of them I should have taken no hurt Wherefore said
Jack modestly there is no credit due to me for there was no valor
in me whatsoever but only a certainty of safety and any coward would
fight if he knew that he were to have all the killing and none of the
scratches

Which words he next day being Sunday repeated in his sermon which he
made on that chapter with which all even Salvation Yeo himself were
well content and edified and allowed him to be as godly a preacher as
he was in spite of his simple ways a valiant and truehearted comrade

They brought away the Spanish officers sword a very good blade and
also a great chain of gold which he wore about his neck both of which
were allotted to Brimblecombe as his fair prize but he accepting the
sword steadfastly refused the chain entreating Amyas to put it into
the common stock and when Amyas refused he cut it into links and
distributed it among those of the boats crew who had succored him
winning thereby much goodwill And indeed says the chronicler
I never saw in that worthy man from the first day of our
schoolfellowship till he was laid in his parish church of Hartland
where he now sleeps in peace any touch of that sin of covetousness
which has in all ages and in ours no less than others beset especially
I know not why them who minister about the sanctuary But this man
though he was ugly and lowly in person and in understanding simple and
of breeding but a poor parsons son had yet in him a spirit so loving
and cheerful so lifted from base and selfish purposes to the worship
of duty and to a generosity rather knightly than sacerdotal that all
through his life he seemed to think only that it was more blessed to
give than to receive And all that wealth which he gained in the wars he
dispersed among his sisters and the poor of his parish living unmarried
till his death like a true lover and constant mourner as shall be said
in place and leaving hardly wherewith to bring his body to the
grave At whom if we often laughed once we should now rather envy him
desiring to be here what he was that we may be hereafter where he is
Amen



CHAPTER XIX

WHAT BEFELL AT LA GUAYRA

 Great was the crying the running and riding
 Which at that season was made in the place
 The beacons were fired as need then required
 To save their great treasure they had little space

 Winning of Cales

The men would gladly have hawked awhile round Margarita and Cubagua for
another pearl prize But Amyas having as he phrased it fleshed his
dogs was loth to hang about the islands after the alarm had been
given They ran therefore southwest across the mouth of that great
bay which stretches from the Peninsula of Paria to Cape Codera leaving
on their right hand Tortuga and on their left the meadowislands of the
Piritoos two long green lines but a few inches above the tideless sea
Yeo and Drew knew every foot of the way and had good reason to know it
for they the first of all English mariners had tried to trade along
this coast with Hawkins And now right ahead sheer out of the sea from
base to peak arose higher and higher the mighty range of the Caracas
mountains beside which all hills which most of the crew had ever seen
seemed petty mounds Frank of course knew the Alps and Amyas the
Andes but Carys notions of height were bounded by MGillicuddys
Reeks and Brimblecombes by Exmoor and the latter to Carys infinite
amusement spent a whole day holding on by the rigging and staring
upwards with his chin higher than his nose till he got a stiff neck
Soon the sea became rough and chopping though the breeze was fair and
gentle and ere they were abreast of the Cape they became aware of
that strong eastward current which during the winter months so often
baffles the mariner who wishes to go to the westward All night long
they struggled through the billows with the huge wall of Cape Codera a
thousand feet above their heads to the left and beyond it again bank
upon bank of mountain bathed in the yellow moonlight

Morning showed them a large ship which had passed them during the night
upon the opposite course and was now a good ten miles to the eastward
Yeo was for going back and taking her Of the latter he made a matter of
course and the former was easy enough for the breeze blowing dead off
the land was a soldiers wind there and back again for either ship
but Amyas and Frank were both unwilling

Why Yeo you said that one day more would bring us to La Guayra

All the more reason sir for doing the Lords work thoroughly when He
has brought us safely so far on our journey

She can pass well enough and no loss

Ah sirs sirs she is delivered into your hands and you will have to
give an account of her

My good Yeo said Frank I trust we shall give good account enough
of many a tall Spaniard before we return but you know surely that La
Guayra and the salvation of one whom we believe dwells there was our
first object in this adventure

Yeo shook his head sadly Ah sirs a lady brought Captain Oxenham to
ruin

You do not dare to compare her with this one said Frank and Cary
both in a breath

God forbid gentlemen but no adventure will prosper unless there is a
single eye to the Lords work and that is as I take it to cripple
the Spaniard and exalt her majesty the queen And I had thought that
nothing was more dear than that to Captain Leighs heart

Amyas stood somewhat irresolute His duty to the queen bade him follow
the Spanish vessel his duty to his vow to go on to La Guayra It may
seem a farfetched dilemma He found it a practical one enough

However the counsel of Frank prevailed and on to La Guayra he went He
half hoped that the Spaniard would see and attack them However he went
on his way to the eastward which if he had not done my story had had a
very different ending

About midday a canoe the first which they had seen came staggering
toward them under a huge threecornered sail As it came near they
could see two Indians on board

Metal floats in these seas you see quoth Cary Theres a fresh
marvel for you Frank

Expound quoth Frank who was really ready to swallow any fresh
marvel so many had he seen already

Why how else would those two bronze statues dare to go to sea in such
a cockleshell eh Have I given you the dor now master courtier

I am long past dors Will But what noble creatures they are and how
fearlessly they are coming alongside Can they know that we are English
and the avengers of the Indians

I suspect they just take us for Spaniards and want to sell their
cocoanuts See the canoe is laden with vegetables

Hail them Yeo said Amyas You talk the best Spanish and I want
speech of one of them

Yeo did so the canoe without more ado ran alongside and lowered her
felucca sail while a splendid Indian scrambled on board like a cat

He was full six feet high and as bold and graceful of bearing as Frank
or Amyass self He looked round for the first moment smilingly showing
his white teeth but the next his countenance changed and springing to
the side he shouted to his comrade in Spanish

Treachery No Spaniard and would have leaped overboard but a dozen
strong fellows caught him ere he could do so

It required some trouble to master him so strong was he and so
slippery his naked limbs Amyas meanwhile alternately entreated the
men not to hurt the Indian and the Indian to be quiet and no harm
should happen to him and so after five minutes confusion the
stranger gave in sulkily

Dont bind him Let him loose and make a ring round him Now my man
theres a dollar for you

The Indians eyes glistened and he took the coin

All I want of you is first to tell me what ships are in La Guayra
and next to go thither on board of me and show me which is the
governors house and which the customhouse

The Indian laid the coin down on the deck and crossing himself looked
Amyas in the face

No senor I am a freeman and a cavalier a Christian Guayqueria
whose forefathers first of all the Indians swore fealty to the King of
Spain and whom he calls to this day in all his proclamations his most
faithful loyal and noble Guayquerias God forbid therefore that I
should tell aught to his enemies who are my enemies likewise

A growl arose from those of the men who understood him and more than
one hinted that a cord twined round the head or a match put between the
fingers would speedily extract the required information

God forbid said Amyas a brave and loyal man he is and as such
will I treat him Tell me my brave fellow how do you know us to be his
Catholic majestys enemies

The Indian with a shrewd smile pointed to halfadozen different
objects saying to each Not Spanish

Well and what of that

None but Spaniards and free Guayquerias have a right to sail these
seas

Amyas laughed

Thou art a right valiant bit of copper Pick up thy dollar and go thy
way in peace Make room for him men We can learn what we want without
his help

The Indian paused incredulous and astonished Overboard with you
quoth Amyas Dont you know when you are well off

Most illustrious senor began the Indian in the drawling sententious
fashion of his race when they take the trouble to talk at all I
have been deceived I heard that you heretics roasted and ate all true
Catholics as we Guayquerias are and that all your padres had tails

Plague on you sirrah squeaked Jack Brimblecombe Have I a tail
Look here

Quien sabe Who knows quoth the Indian through his nose

How do you know we are heretics said Amyas

Humph But in repayment for your kindness I would warn you
illustrious senor not to go on to La Guayra There are ships of war
there waiting for you and moreover the governor Don Guzman sailed to
the eastward only yesterday to look for you and I wonder much that you
did not meet him

To look for us On the watch for us said Cary Impossible lies
Amyas this is some trick of the rascals to frighten us away

Don Guzman came out but yesterday to look for us Are you sure you
spoke truth

As I live senor he and another ship for which I took yours

Amyas stamped upon the deck that then was the ship which they had
passed

Fool that I was to have been close to my enemy and let my opportunity
slip If I had but done my duty all would have gone right

But it was too late to repine and after all the Indians story was
likely enough to be false

Off with you said he and the Indian bounded over the side into his
canoe leaving the whole crew wondering at the stateliness and courtesy
of this bold seacavalier

So Westwardho they ran beneath the mighty northern wall the highest
cliff on earth some seven thousand feet of rock parted from the sea
by a narrow strip of bright green lowland Here and there a patch of
sugarcane or a knot of cocoanut trees close to the waters edge
reminded them that they were in the tropics but above all was savage
rough and bare as an Alpine precipice Sometimes deep clefts allowed
the southern sun to pour a blaze of light down to the sea marge and
gave glimpses far above of strange and stately trees lining the glens
and of a veil of perpetual mist which shrouded the inner summits while
up and down between them and the mountain side white fleecy clouds
hung motionless in the burning air increasing the impression of
vastness and of solemn rest which was already overpowering

Within those mountains three thousand feet above our heads said
Drew the master lies Saint Yago de Leon the great city which the
Spaniards founded fifteen years agone

Is it a rich place asked Cary

Very they say

Is it a strong place asked Amyas

No forts to it at all they say The Spaniards boast that Heaven has
made such good walls to it already that man need make none

I dont know quoth Amyas Lads could you climb those hills do you
think

Rather higher than Harty Point sir but it depends pretty much on
whats behind them

And now the last point is rounded and they are full in sight of the
spot in quest of which they have sailed four thousand miles of sea A
low black cliff crowned by a wall a battery at either end Within a
few narrow streets of white houses running parallel with the sea upon
a strip of flat which seemed not two hundred yards in breadth and
behind the mountain wall covering the whole in deepest shade How that
wall was ever ascended to the inland seemed the puzzle but Drew who
had been off the place before pointed out to them a narrow path which
wound upwards through a glen seemingly sheer perpendicular That was
the road to the capital if any man dare try it In spite of the shadow
of the mountain the whole place wore a dusty and glaring look The
breaths of air which came off the land were utterly stifling and no
wonder for La Guayra owing to the radiation of that vast firebrick
of heated rock is one of the hottest spots upon the face of the whole
earth

Where was the harbor There was none Only an open roadstead wherein
lay tossing at anchor five vessels The two outer ones were small
merchant caravels Behind them lay two long low uglylooking craft at
sight of which Yeo gave a long whew

Galleys as Im a sinful saint And whats that big one inside of them
Robert Drew She has more than hawseholes in her idolatrous black sides
I think

We shall open her astern of the galleys in another minute said Amyas
Look out Cary your eyes are better than mine

Six round portholes on the main deck quoth Will

And I can see the brass patararoes glittering on her poop quoth
Amyas Will were in for it

In for it we are captain

 Farewell farewell my parents dear
 I never shall see you more I fear

Lets go in nevertheless and pound the Dons ribs my old lad of
Smerwick Eh Three to one is very fair odds

Not underneath those fort guns I beg leave to say quoth Yeo If the
Philistines will but come out unto us we will make them like unto Zeba
and Zalmunna

Quite true said Amyas Game cocks are game cocks but reasons
reason

If the Philistines are not coming out they are going to send a
messenger instead quoth Cary Look out all thin skulls

And as he spoke a puff of white smoke rolled from the eastern fort and
a heavy ball plunged into the water between it and the ship

I dont altogether like this quoth Amyas What do they mean by
firing on us without warning And what are these ships of war doing
here Drew you told me the armadas never lay here

No more I believe they do sir on account of the anchorage being so
bad as you may see Im mortal afeared that rascals story was true
and that the Dons have got wind of our coming

Run up a white flag at all events If they do expect us they must
have known some time since or how could they have got their craft
hither

True sir They must have come from Santa Marta at the least perhaps
from Cartagena And that would take a month at least going and coming

Amyas suddenly recollected Eustaces threat in the wayside inn Could he
have betrayed their purpose Impossible

Let us hold a council of war at all events Frank

Frank was absorbed in a very different matter A halfmile to the
eastward of the town two or three hundred feet up the steep mountain
side stood a large low white house embosomed in trees and gardens
There was no other house of similar size near no place for one And was
not that the royal flag of Spain which flaunted before it That must be
the governors house that must be the abode of the Rose of Torridge
And Frank stood devouring it with wild eyes till he had persuaded
himself that he could see a womans figure walking upon the terrace
in front and that the figure was none other than hers whom he sought
Amyas could hardly tear him away to a council of war which was a sad
and only not a peevish one

The three adventurers with Brimblecombe Yeo and Drew went apart upon
the poop and each looked the other in the face awhile For what was
to be done The plans and hopes of months were brought to naught in an
hour

It is impossible you see said Amyas at last to surprise the town
by land while these ships are here for if we land our men we leave
our ship without defence

As impossible as to challenge Don Guzman while he is not here said
Cary

I wonder why the ships have not opened on us already said Drew

Perhaps they respect our flag of truce said Cary Why not send in a
boat to treat with them and to inquire for

For her interrupted Frank If we show that we are aware of her
existence her name is blasted in the eyes of those jealous Spaniards

And as for respecting our flag of truce gentlemen said Yeo if you
will take an old mans advice trust them not They will keep the same
faith with us as they kept with Captain Hawkins at San Juan dUlloa in
that accursed business which was the beginning of all the wars when
we might have taken the whole platefleet with two hundred thousand
pounds worth of gold on board and did not but only asked license to
trade like honest men And yet after they had granted us license and
deceived us by fair speech into landing ourselves and our ordnance the
governor and all the fleet set upon us five to one and gave no quarter
to any soul whom he took No sir I expect the only reason why they
dont attack us is because their crews are not on board

They will be soon enough then said Amyas I can see soldiers
coming down the landingstairs

And in fact boats full of armed men began to push off to the ships

We may thank Heaven said Drew that we were not here two hours
agone The sun will be down before they are ready for sea and the
fellows will have no stomach to go looking for us by night

So much the worse for us If they will but do that we may give them
the slip and back again to the town and there try our luck for I
cannot find it in my heart to leave the place without having one dash at
it

Yeo shook his head There are plenty more towns along the coast more
worth trying than this sir but Heavens will be done

And as they spoke the sun plunged into the sea and all was dark

At last it was agreed to anchor and wait till midnight If the ships
of war came out they were to try to run in past them and desperate
as the attempt might be attempt their original plan of landing to the
westward of the town taking it in flank plundering the government
storehouses which they saw close to the landingplace and then
fighting their way back to their boats and out of the roadstead Two
hours would suffice if the armada and the galleys were but once out of
the way

Amyas went forward called the men together and told them the plan It
was not very cheerfully received but what else was there to be done

They ran down about a mile and a half to the westward and anchored

The night wore on and there was no sign of stir among the shipping
for though they could not see the vessels themselves yet their lights
easily distinguished by their relative height from those in the town
above remained motionless and the men fretted and fumed for weary
hours at thus seeing a rich prize for of course the town was paved with
gold within arms reach and yet impossible

Let Amyas and his men have patience Some short five years more and the
great Armada will have come and gone and then that avenging storm
of which they like Oxenham Hawkins and Drake are but the
avantcouriers will burst upon every Spanish port from Corunna to
Cadiz from the Canaries to Havana and La Guayra and St Yago de Leon
will not escape their share Captain Amyas Preston and Captain Sommers
the colonist of the Bermudas or Sommers Islands will land with a
force tiny enough though larger far than Leighs where Leigh dare not
land and taking the fort of Guayra will find as Leigh found that
their coming has been expected and that the Pass of the Venta three
thousand feet above has been fortified with huge barricadoes abattis
and cannon making the capital amid its ring of mountainwalls
impregnableto all but Englishmen or Zouaves For up that seven
thousand feet of precipice which rises stair on stair behind the town
those fierce adventurers will climb hand over hand through rain and
fog while men lie down and beg their officers to kill them for no
farther can they go Yet farther they will go hewing a path with their
swords through woods of wild plantain and rhododendron thickets over
so it seems however incredible the very saddle of the Silla down
upon the astonished Mantuanos of St Jago driving all before them
and having burnt the city in default of ransom will return triumphant
by the right road and pass along the coast the masters of the deep

  Humboldt says that there is a path from Caravellada to St
 Jago between the peaks used by smugglers This is
 probably the unknowen way of the Indians which Preston
 used

I know not whether any men still live who count their descent from those
two valiant captains but if such there be let them be sure that the
history of the English navy tells no more Titanic victory over nature
and man than that now forgotten raid of Amyas Preston and his comrade
in the year of grace 1595

But though a venture on the town was impossible yet there was another
venture which Frank was unwilling to let slip A light which now shone
brightly in one of the windows of the governors house was the lodestar
to which all his thoughts were turned and as he sat in the cabin with
Amyas Cary and Jack he opened his heart to them

And are we then asked he mournfully to go without doing the very
thing for which we came

All were silent awhile At last John Brimblecombe spoke

Show me the way to do it Mr Frank and I will go

My dearest man said Amyas what would you have Any attempt to see
her even if she be here would be all but certain death

And what if it were What if it were my brother Amyas Listen to me I
have long ceased to shrink from Death but till I came into these magic
climes I never knew the beauty of his face

Of death said Cary I should have said of life God forgive me but
man might wish to live forever if he had such a world as this wherein
to live

And do you forget Cary that the more fair this passing world of time
by so much the more fair is that eternal world whereof all here is but
a shadow and a dream by so much the more fair is He before whose throne
the four mystic beasts the substantial ideas of Nature and her powers
stand day and night crying Holy holy holy Lord God of hosts Thou
hast made all things and for Thy pleasure they are and were created
My friends if He be so prodigal of His own glory as to have decked
these lonely shores all but unknown since the foundation of the world
with splendors beyond all our dreams what must be the glory of His face
itself I have done with vain shadows It is better to depart and to be
with Him where shall be neither desire nor anger selfdeception nor
pretence but the eternal fulness of reality and truth One thing I
have to do before I die for God has laid it on me Let that be done
tonight and then farewell

Frank Frank remember our mother

I do remember her I have talked over these things with her many a
time and where I would fain be she would fain be also She sent me out
with my virgin honor as the Spartan mother did her boy with the shield
saying Come back either with this or upon this and one or the other
I must do if I would meet her either in this life or in the next But
in the meanwhile do not mistake me my life is Gods and I promise not
to cast it away rashly

What would you do then

Go up to that house Amyas and speak with her if Heaven gives me an
opportunity as Heaven I feel assured will give

And do you call that no rashness

Is any duty rashness Is it rash to stand amid the flying bullets if
your queen has sent you Is it more rash to go to seek Christs lost
lamb if God and your own oath hath sent you John Brimblecombe answered
that question for us long ago

If you go I go with you said all three at once

No Amyas you owe a duty to our mother and to your ship Cary you are
heir to great estates and are bound thereby to your country and to your
tenants John Brimblecombe

Ay squeaked Jack And what have you to say Mr Frank against my
goingI who have neither ship nor estatesexcept I suppose that I
am not worthy to travel in such good company

Think of your old parents John and all your sisters

I thought of them before I started sir as Mr Cary knows and
you know too I came here to keep my vow and I am not going to turn
renegade at the very foot of the cross

Some one must go with you Frank said Amyas if it were only to
bring back the boats crew in case and he faltered

In case I fall replied Frank with a smile I will finish your
sentence for you lad I am not afraid of it though you may be for me
Yet some one I fear must go Unhappy me that I cannot risk my own
worthless life without risking your more precious lives

Not so Mr Frank Your oath is our oath and your duty ours said
John I will tell you what we will do gentlemen all We three will
draw cuts for the honor of going with him

Lots said Amyas I dont like leaving such grave matters to chance
friend John

Chance sir When you have used all your own wit and find it fail you
then what is drawing lots but taking the matter out of your own weak
hands and laying it in Gods strong hands

Right John said Frank So did the apostles choose their successor
and so did holy men of old decide controversies too subtle for them
and we will not be ashamed to follow their example For my part I have
often said to Sidney and to Spenser when we have babbled together of
Utopian governments in days which are now dreams to me that I would
have all officers of state chosen by lot out of the wisest and most fit
so making sure that they should be called by God and not by man alone
Gentlemen do you agree to Sir Johns advice

They agreed seeing no better counsel and John put three slips of paper
into Franks hand with the simple old apostolic prayer

Show which of us three Thou hast chosen

The lot fell upon Amyas Leigh

Frank shuddered and clasped his hands over his face

Well said Cary I have illluck tonight but Frank goes at least in
good company

Ah that it had been I said Jack though I suppose I was too poor a
body to have such an honor fall on me And yet it is hard for flesh and
blood hard indeed to have come all this way and not to see her after
all

Jack said Frank you are kept to do better work than this doubt
not But if the lot had fallen on youay if it had fallen on a three
years child I would have gone up as cheerfully with that child to lead
me as I do now with this my brother Amyas can we have a boat and a
crew It is near midnight already

Amyas went on deck and asked for six volunteers Whosoever would come
Amyas would double out of his own purse any prizemoney which might fall
to that mans share

One of the old Pelicans crew Simon Evans of Clovelly stepped out at
once

Why six only captain Give the word and any and all of us will go
up with you sack the house and bring off the treasure and the lady
before two hours are out

No no my brave lads As for treasure if there be any it is sure to
have been put all safe into the forts or hidden in the mountains and
as for the lady God forbid that we should force her a step without her
own will

The honest sailor did not quite understand this punctilio but

Well captain quoth he as you like but no man shall say that you
asked for a volunteer were it to jump down a sharks throat but what
you had me first of all the crew

After this sort of temper had been exhibited three or four more came
forwardYeo was very anxious to go but Amyas forbade him

Ill volunteer sir without reward for this or anything though
added he in a lower tone I would to Heaven that the thought had never
entered your head

And so would I have volunteered said Simon Evans if it were the
ships quarrel or the queens but being its a private matter of the
captains and Ive a wife and children at home why I take no shame to
myself for asking money for my life

So the crew was made up but ere they pushed off Amyas called Cary
aside

If I perish Will

Dont talk of such things dear old lad

I must Then you are captain Do nothing without Yeo and Drew But if
they approve go right north away for San Domingo and Cuba and try the
ports they can have no news of us there and there is booty without
end Tell my mother that I died like a gentleman and mindmind dear
lad to keep your temper with the men let the poor fellows grumble as
they may Mind but that and fear God and all will go well

The tears were glistening in Carys eyes as he pressed Amyass hand and
watched the two brothers down over the side upon their desperate errand

They reached the pebble beach There seemed no difficulty about finding
the path to the houseso bright was the moon and so careful a survey
of the place had Frank taken Leaving the men with the boat Amyas had
taken care that they should be well armed they started up the beach
with their swords only Frank assured Amyas that they would find a path
leading from the beach up to the house and he was not mistaken They
found it easily for it was made of white shell sand and following it
struck into a tunal or belt of tall thorny cactuses Through this
the path wound in zigzags up a steep rocky slope and ended at a
wicketgate They tried it and found it open

She may expect us whispered Frank

Impossible

Why not She must have seen our ship and if as seems the townsfolk
know who we are how much more must she Yes doubt it not she still
longs to hear news of her own land and some secret sympathy will draw
her down towards the sea tonight See the light is in the window
still

But if not said Amyas who had no such expectation what is your
plan

I have none

None

I have imagined twenty different ones in the last hour but all are
equally uncertain impossible I have ceased to struggleI go where
I am called loves willing victim If Heaven accept the sacrifice it
will provide the altar and the knife

Aymas was at his wits end Judging of his brother by himself he had
taken for granted that Frank had some wellconcocted scheme for gaining
admittance to the Rose and as the wiles of love were altogether out of
his province he had followed in full faith such a sansappel as he held
Frank to be But now he almost doubted of his brothers sanity though
Franks manner was perfectly collected and his voice firm Amyas honest
fellow had no understanding of that intense devotion which so many in
those days not content with looking on it as a lofty virtue and yet
one to be duly kept in its place by other duties prided themselves on
pampering into the most fantastic and selfwilled excesses

Beautiful folly the deathsong of which two great geniuses were
composing at that very moment each according to his light For while
Spenser was embalming in immortal verse all that it contained of noble
and Christian elements Cervantes sat perhaps in his dungeon writing
with his left hand Don Quixote saddest of books in spite of all its
wit the story of a pure and noble soul who mistakes this actual life
for that ideal one which he fancies and not so wrongly either eternal
in the heavens and finding instead of a battlefield for heroes in Gods
cause nothing but frivolity heartlessness and godlessness becomes a
laughingstockand dies One of the saddest books I say again which
man can read

Amyas hardly dare trust himself to speak for fear of saying too much
but he could not help saying

You are going to certain death Frank

Did I not entreat answered he very quietly to go alone

Amyas had half a mind to compel him to return but he feared Franks
obstinacy and feared too the shame of returning on board without
having done anything so they went up through the wicketgate along a
smooth turf walk into what seemed a pleasuregarden formed by the hand
of man or rather of woman For by the light not only of the moon but
of the innumerable fireflies which flitted to and fro across the sward
like fiery imps sent to light the brothers on their way they could see
that the bushes on either side and the trees above their heads were
decked with flowers of such strangeness and beauty that as Frank
once said of Barbados even the gardens of Wilton were a desert in
comparison All around were orange and lemon trees probably the only
addition which man had made to Natures prodigality the fruit of
which in that strange colored light of the fireflies flashed in their
eyes like balls of burnished gold and emerald while great white tassels
swinging from every tree in the breeze which swept down the glade
tossed in their faces a fragrant snow of blossoms and glittering drops
of perfumed dew

What a paradise said Amyas to Frank with the serpent in it as of
old Look

And as he spoke there dropped slowly down from a bough right before
them what seemed a living chain of gold ruby and sapphire Both
stopped and another glance showed the small head and bright eyes of a
snake hissing and glaring full in their faces

See said Frank And he comes as of old in the likeness of an angel
of light Do not strike it There are worse devils to be fought with
tonight than that poor beast And stepping aside they passed the
snake safely and arrived in front of the house

It was as I have said a long low house with balconies along the upper
story and the under part mostly open to the wind The light was still
burning in the window

Whither now said Amyas in a tone of desperate resignation

Thither Where else on earth and Frank pointed to the light
trembling from head to foot and pushed on

For Heavens sake Look at the negroes on the barbecue

It was indeed time to stop for on the barbecue or terrace of white
plaster which ran all round the front lay sleeping full twenty black
figures

What will you do now You must step over them to gain an entrance

Wait here and I will go up gently towards the window She may see me
She will see me as I step into the moonlight At least I know an air by
which she will recognize me if I do but hum a stave

Why you do not even know that that light is hersDown for your
life

And Amyas dragged him down into the bushes on his left hand for one
of the negroes wakening suddenly with a cry had sat up and began
crossing himself four or five times in fear of Duppy and mumbling
various charms ayes or what not

The light above was extinguished instantly

Did you see her whispered Frank

No

I didthe shadow of the face and the neck Can I be mistaken And
then covering his face with his hands he murmured to himself Misery
misery So near and yet impossible

Would it be the less impossible were you face to face Let us go back
We cannot go up without detection even if our going were of use Come
back for Gods sake ere all is lost If you have seen her as you say
you know at least that she is alive and safe in his house

As his mistress or as his wife Do I know that yet Amyas and can I
depart until I know There was a few minutes silence and then Amyas
making one last attempt to awaken Frank to the absurdity of the whole
thing and to laugh him if possible out of it as argument had no
effect

My dear fellow I am very hungry and sleepy and this bush is very
prickly and my boots are full of ants

So are mineLook and Frank caught Amyass arm and clenched it
tight

For round the farther corner of the house a dark cloaked figure stole
gently turning a look now and then upon the sleeping negroes and came
on right toward them

Did I not tell you she would come whispered Frank in a triumphant
tone

Amyas was quite bewildered and to his mind the apparition seemed
magical and Frank prophetic for as the figure came nearer incredulous
as he tried to be there was no denying that the shape and the walk were
exactly those of her to find whom they had crossed the Atlantic True
the figure was somewhat taller but then she must be grown since I saw
her thought Amyas and his heart for the moment beat as fiercely as
Franks

But what was that behind her Her shadow against the white wall of the
house Not so Another figure cloaked likewise but taller far was
following on her steps It was a mans They could see that he wore a
broad sombrero It could not be Don Guzman for he was at sea Who then
Here was a mystery perhaps a tragedy And both brothers held their
breaths while Amyas felt whether his sword was loose in the sheath

The Rose if indeed it was she was within ten yards of them when she
perceived that she was followed She gave a little shriek The cavalier
sprang forward lifted his hat courteously and joined her bowing low
The moonlight was full upon his face

It is Eustace our cousin How came he here in the name of all the
fiends

Eustace Then that is she after all said Frank forgetting
everything else in her

And now flashed across Amyas all that had passed between him and Eustace
in the moorland inn and Parracombes story too of the suspicious
gipsy Eustace had been beforehand with them and warned Don Guzman All
was explained now but how had he got hither

The devil his master sent him hither on a broomstick I suppose or
what matter how Here he is and here we are worse luck And setting
his teeth Amyas awaited the end

The two came on talking earnestly and walking at a slow pace so that
the brothers could hear every word

What shall we do now said Frank We have no right to be
eavesdroppers

But we must be right or none And Amyas held him down firmly by the
arm

But whither are you going then my dear madam they heard Eustace
say in a wheedling tone Can you wonder if such strange conduct should
cause at least sorrow to your admirable and faithful husband

Husband whispered Frank faintly to Amyas Thank God thank God I am
content Let us go

But to go was impossible for as fate would have it the two had
stopped just opposite them

The inestimable Senor Don Guzman began Eustace again

What do you mean by praising him to me in this fulsome way sir Do you
suppose that I do not know his virtues better than you

If you do madam this was spoken in a harder tone it were wise for
you to try them less severely than by wandering down towards the beach
on the very night that you know his most deadly enemies are lying in
wait to slay him plunder his house and most probably to carry you off
from him

Carry me off I will die first

Who can prove that to him Appearances are at least against you

My love to him and his trust for me sir

His trust Have you forgotten madam what passed last week and why he
sailed yesterday

The only answer was a burst of tears Eustace stood watching her with a
terrible eye but they could see his face writhing in the moonlight

Oh sobbed she at last And if I have been imprudent was it not
natural to wish to look once more upon an English ship Are you not
English as well as I Have you no longing recollections of the dear old
land at home

Eustace was silent but his face worked more fiercely than ever

How can he ever know it

Why should he not know it

Ah she burst out passionately why not indeed while you are here
You sir the tempter you the eavesdropper you the sunderer of loving
hearts You serpent who found our home a paradise and see it now a
hell

Do you dare to accuse me thus madam without a shadow of evidence

Dare I dare anything for I know all I have watched you sir and I
have borne with you too long

Me madam whose only sin towards you as you should know by now is to
have loved you too well Rose Rose have you not blighted my life for
mebroken my heart And how have I repaid you How but by sacrificing
myself to seek you over land and sea that I might complete your
conversion to the bosom of that Church where a Virgin Mother stands
stretching forth soft arms to embrace her wandering daughter and cries
to you all day long Come unto me ye that are weary and heavy laden
and I will give you rest And this is my reward

Depart with your Virgin Mother sir and tempt me no more You have
asked me what I dare and I dare this upon my own ground and in my
own garden I Donna Rosa de Soto to bid you leave this place now and
forever after having insulted me by talking of your love and tempted
me to give up that faith which my husband promised me he would respect
and protect Go sir

The brothers listened breathless with surprise as much as with rage
Love and conscience and perhaps too the pride of her lofty alliance
had converted the once gentle and dreamy Rose into a very Roxana but it
was only the impulse of a moment The words had hardly passed her lips
when terrified at what she had said she burst into a fresh flood of
tears while Eustace answered calmly

I go madam but how know you that I may not have orders and that
after your last strange speech my conscience may compel me to obey
those orders to take you with me

Me with you

My heart has bled for you madam for many a year It longs now that
it had bled itself to death and never known the last worst agony of
telling you

And drawing close to her he whispered in her earwhat the brothers
heard notbut her answer was a shriek which rang through the woods and
sent the nightbirds fluttering up from every bough above their heads

By Heaven said Amyas I can stand this no longer Cut that devils
throat I must

She is lost if his dead body is found by her

We are lost if we stay here then said Amyas for those negroes will
hurry down at her cry and then found we must be

Are you mad madam to betray yourself by your own cries The negroes
will be here in a moment I give you one last chance for life then
and Eustace shouted in Spanish at the top of his voice Help help
servants Your mistress is being carried off by bandits

What do you mean sir

Let your womans wit supply the rest and forget not him who thus saves
you from disgrace

Whether the brothers heard the last words or not I know not but taking
for granted that Eustace had discovered them they sprang to their feet
at once determined to make one last appeal and then to sell their
lives as dearly as they could

Eustace started back at the unexpected apparition but a second glance
showed him Amyass mighty bulk and he spoke calmly

You see madam I did not call without need Welcome good cousins My
charity as you perceive has found means to outstrip your craft while
the fair lady as was but natural has been true to her assignation

Liar cried Frank She never knew of our being

Credat Judaeus answered Eustace but as he spoke Amyas burst
through the bushes at him There was no time to be lost and ere the
giant could disentangle himself from the boughs and shrubs Eustace had
slipped off his long cloak thrown it over Amyass head and ran up the
alley shouting for help

Mad with rage Amyas gave chase but in two minutes more Eustace was
safe among the ranks of the negroes who came shouting and jabbering
down the path

He rushed back Frank was just ending some wild appeal to Rose

Your conscience your religion

No never I can face the chance of death but not the loss of him Go
for Gods sake leave me

You are lost thenand I have ruined you

Come off now or never cried Amyas clutching him by the arm and
dragging him away like a child

You forgive me cried he

Forgive you and she burst into tears again

Frank burst into tears also

Let me go back and die with herAmyasmy oathmy honor and he
struggled to turn back

Amyas looked back too and saw her standing calmly with her hands
folded across her breast awaiting Eustace and the servants and he half
turned to go back also Both saw how fearfully appearances had put her
into Eustaces power Had he not a right to suspect that they were there
by her appointment that she was going to escape with them And would
not Eustace use his power The thought of the Inquisition crossed their
minds Was that the threat which Eustace had whispered asked he of
Frank

It was groaned Frank in answer

For the first and last time in his life Amyas Leigh stood irresolute

Back and stab her to the heart first said Frank struggling to
escape from him

Oh if Amyas were but alone and Frank safe home in England To charge
the whole mob kill her kill Eustace and then cut his way back again
to the ship or diewhat matter as he must die some daysword in
hand But Frankand then flashed before his eyes his mothers hopeless
face then rang in his ears his mothers last bequest to him of that
frail treasure Let Rose let honor let the whole world perish he must
save Frank See the negroes were up with her nowpast heraway for
life and once more he dragged his brother down the hill and through
the wicket only just in time for the whole gang of negroes were within
ten yards of them in full pursuit

Frank said he sharply if you ever hope to see your mother again
rouse yourself man and fight And without waiting for an answer he
turned and charged uphill upon his pursuers who saw the long bright
blade and fled instantly

Again he hurried Frank down the hill the path wound in zigzags and he
feared that the negroes would come straight over the cliff and so cut
off his retreat but the prickly cactuses were too much for them and
they were forced to follow by the path while the brothers Frank having
somewhat regained his senses turned every now and then to menace
them but once on the rocky path stones began to fly fast small ones
fortunately and wide and wild for want of lightbut when they reached
the pebblebeach Both were too proud to run but if ever Amyas prayed
in his life he prayed for the last twenty yards before he reached the
watermark

Now Frank down to the boat as hard as you can run while I keep the
curs back

Amyas what do you take me for My madness brought you hither your
devotion shall not bring me back without you

Together then

And putting Franks arm through his they hurried down shouting to
their men

The boat was not fifty yards off but fast travelling over the pebbles
was impossible and long ere half the distance was crossed the negroes
were on the beach and the storm burst A volley of great quartz pebbles
whistled round their heads

Come on Frank for lifes sake Men to the rescue Ah what was
that

The dull crash of a pebble against Franks fair head Drooping like
Hyacinthus beneath the blow of the quoit he sank on Amyass arm The
giant threw him over his shoulder and plunged blindly onhimself
struck again and again

Fire men Give it the black villains

The arquebuses crackled from the boat in front What were those
dull thuds which answered from behind Echoes No Over his head the
caliverballs went screeching The governors guard have turned out
followed them to the beach fixed their calivers and are firing over
the negroes heads as the savages rush down upon the hapless brothers

If as all say there are moments which are hours how many hours was
Amyas Leigh in reaching that boats bow Alas the negroes are there as
soon as he and the guard having left their calivers are close behind
them sword in hand Amyas is up to his knees in waterbattered with
stonesblinded with blood The boat is swaying off and on against the
steep pebblebank he clutches at itmissesfalls headlongrises
halfchoked with water but Frank is still in his arms Another heavy
blowa confused roar of shouts shots cursesa confused mass of
negroes and English foam and pebblesand he recollects no more

     

He is lying in the sternsheets of the boat stiff weak half blind
with blood He looks up the moon is still bright overhead but they are
away from the shore now for the wavecrests are dancing white before
the landbreeze high above the boats side The boat seems strangely
empty Two men are pulling instead of six And what is this lying heavy
across his chest He pushes and is answered by a groan He puts his
hand down to rise and is answered by another groan

Whats this

All that are left of us says Simon Evans of Clovelly

All The bottom of the boat seemed paved with human bodies Oh
God oh God moans Amyas trying to rise And wherewhere is Frank
Frank

Mr Frank cries Evans There is no answer

Dead shrieks Amyas Look for him for Gods sake look and
struggling from under his living load he peers into each pale and
bleeding face

Where is he Why dont you speak forward there

Because we have naught to say sir answers Evans almost surlily

Frank was not there

Put the boat about To the shore roars Amyas

Look over the gunwale and judge for yourself sir

The waves are leaping fierce and high before a furious landbreeze
Return is impossible

Cowards villains traitors hounds to have left him behind

Listen you to me Captain Amyas Leigh says Simon Evans resting on
his oar and hang me for mutiny if you will when were aboard if we
ever get there Isnt it enough to bring us out to death as you knew
yourself sir for youre prudent enough to please that poor young
gentlemans fancy about a wench but you must call coward an honest man
that have saved your life this night and not a one of us but has his
wound to show

Amyas was silent the rebuke was just

I tell you sir if weve hove a stone out of this boat since we got
off weve hove two hundredweight and if the Lord had not fought for
us shed have been beat to nogginstaves there on the beach

How did I come here then

Tom Hart dragged you in out of five feet water and then thrust the
boat off and had his brains beat out for reward All were knocked down
but us two So help me God we thought that you had hove Mr Frank on
board just as you were knocked down and saw William Frost drag him in

But William Frost was lying senseless in the bottom of the boat There
was no explanation After all none was needed

And I have three wounds from stones and this man behind me as many
more beside a shot through his shoulder Now sir be we cowards

You have done your duty said Amyas and sank down in the boat and
cried as if his heart would break and then sprang up and wounded as
he was took the oar from Evanss hands With weary work they made the
ship but so exhausted that another boat had to be lowered to get them
alongside

The alarm being now given it was hardly safe to remain where they were
and after a stormy and sad argument it was agreed to weigh anchor and
stand off and on till morning for Amyas refused to leave the spot till
he was compelled though he had no hope how could he have that Frank
might still be alive And perhaps it was well for them as will appear
in the next chapter that morning did not find them at anchor close to
the town

However that may be so ended that fatal venture of mistaken chivalry



CHAPTER XX

SPANISH BLOODHOUNDS AND ENGLISH MASTIFFS

 Full seven long hours in all mens sight
 This fight endured sore
 Until our men so feeble grew
 That they could fight no more
 And then upon dead horses
 Full savorly they fed
 And drank the puddle water
 They could no better get

 When they had fed so freely
 They kneeled on the ground
 And gave God thanks devoutly for
 The favor they had found
 Then beating up their colors
 The fight they did renew
 And turning to the Spaniards
 A thousand more they slew

 The Brave Lord Willoughby 1586

When the sun leaped up the next morning and the tropic light
flashed suddenly into the tropic day Amyas was pacing the deck with
dishevelled hair and torn clothes his eyes red with rage and weeping
his heart fullhow can I describe it Picture it to yourselves picture
it to yourselves you who have ever lost a brother and you who have
not thank God that you know nothing of his agony Full of impossible
projects he strode and staggered up and down as the ship thrashed
closehauled through the rolling seas He would go back and burn the
villa He would take Guayra and have the life of every man in it in
return for his brothers We can do it lads he shouted If Drake
took Nombre de Dios we can take La Guayra And every voice shouted
Yes

We will have it Amyas and have Frank too yet cried Cary but Amyas
shook his head He knew and knew not why he knew that all the ports in
New Spain would never restore to him that one beloved face

Yes he shall be well avenged And look there There is the first crop
of our vengeance And he pointed toward the shore where between them
and the now distant peaks of the Silla three sails appeared not five
miles to windward

There are the Spanish bloodhounds on our heels the same ships which we
saw yesterday off Guayra Back lads and welcome them if they were a
dozen

There was a murmur of applause from all around and if any young heart
sank for a moment at the prospect of fighting three ships at once it
was awed into silence by the cheer which rose from all the older men
and by Salvation Yeos stentorian voice

If there were a dozen the Lord is with us who has said One of you
shall chase a thousand Clear away lads and see the glory of the Lord
this day

Amen cried Cary and the ship was kept still closer to the wind

Amyas had revived at the sight of battle He no longer felt his wounds
or his great sorrow even Franks last angels look grew dimmer every
moment as he bustled about the deck and ere a quarter of an hour had
passed his voice cried firmly and cheerfully as of old

Now my masters let us serve God and then to breakfast and after
that clear for action

Jack Brimblecombe read the daily prayers and the prayers before a
fight at sea and his honest voice trembled as in the Prayer for
all Conditions of Men in spite of Amyass despair he added and
especially for our dear brother Mr Francis Leigh perhaps captive among
the idolaters and so they rose

Now then said Amyas to breakfast A Frenchman fights best fasting
a Dutchman drunk an Englishman full and a Spaniard when the devil is
in him and thats always

And good beef and the good cause are a match for the devil said Cary
Come down captain you must eat too

Amyas shook his head took the tiller from the steersman and bade him
go below and fill himself Will Cary went down and returned in five
minutes with a plate of bread and beef and a great jack of ale
coaxed them down Amyass throat as a nurse does with a child and then
scuttled below again with tears hopping down his face

Amyas stood still steering His face was grown seven years older in
the last night A terrible set calm was on him Woe to the man who came
across him that day

There are three of them you see my masters said he as the crew
came on deck again A big ship forward and two galleys astern of her
The big ship may keep she is a race ship and if we can but recover
the wind of her we will see whether our height is not a match for her
length We must give her the slip and take the galleys first

I thank the Lord said Yeo who has given so wise a heart to so young
a general a very David and Daniel saving his presence lads and if
any dare not follow him let him be as the men of Meroz and of Succoth
Amen Silas Staveley smite me that boy over the head the young monkey
why is he not down at the powderroom door

And Yeo went about his gunnery as one who knew how to do it and had
the most terrible mind to do it thoroughly and the most terrible faith
that it was Gods work

So all fell to and though there was comparatively little to be done
the ship having been kept as far as could be in fighting order all
night yet there was clearing of decks lacing of nettings making of
bulwarks fitting of waistcloths arming of tops tallowing of pikes
slinging of yards doubling of sheets and tacks enough to satisfy even
the pedantical soul of Richard Hawkins himself Amyas took charge of
the poop Cary of the forecastle and Yeo as gunner of the maindeck
while Drew as master settled himself in the waist and all was ready
and more than ready before the great ship was within two miles of them

And now while the mastiffs of England and the bloodhounds of Spain are
nearing and nearing over the rolling surges thirsting for each others
blood let us spend a few minutes at least in looking at them both and
considering the causes which in those days enabled the English to face
and conquer armaments immensely superior in size and number of ships
and to boast that in the whole Spanish war but one queens ship the
Revenge and if I recollect right but one private manofwar Sir
Richard Hawkinss Dainty had ever struck their colors to the enemy

What was it which enabled Sir Richard Grenvilles Revenge in his last
fearful fight off the Azores to endure for twelve hours before she
struck the attack of eight Spanish armadas of which two three times
her own burden sank at her side and after all her masts were gone and
she had been boarded three times without success to defy to the last
the whole fleet of fiftyfour sail which lay around her waiting for
her to sink like dogs around the dying forest king

What enabled young Richard Hawkinss Dainty though half her guns were
useless through the carelessness or treachery of the gunner to maintain
for three days a running fight with two Spaniards of equal size with
her double the weight of metal and ten times the number of men

What enabled Sir George Carys illustrious ship the Content to fight
singlehanded from seven in the morning till eleven at night with
four great armadas and two galleys though her heaviest gun was but
one ninepounder and for many hours she had but thirteen men fit for
service

What enabled in the very year of which I write those two valiant
Turkey Merchantmen of London the Merchant Royal and the Tobie
with their three small consorts to cripple off Pantellaria in the
Mediterranean the whole fleet of Spanish galleys sent to intercept
them and return triumphant through the Straits of Gibraltar

And lastly what in the fight of 1588 whereof more hereafter enabled
the English fleet to capture destroy and scatter that Great Armada
with the loss but not the capture of one pinnace and one gentleman of
note

There were more causes than one the first seems to have lain in the
build of the English ships the second in their superior gunnery and
weight of metal the third without which the first would have been
useless in the hearts of the English men

The English ship was much shorter than the Spanish and this with
the rig of those days gave them an ease in manoeuvring which utterly
confounded their Spanish foes The English ships in the fight of 1588
says Camden charged the enemy with marvellous agility and having
discharged their broadsides flew forth presently into the deep and
levelled their shot directly without missing at those great ships of
the Spaniards which were altogether heavy and unwieldy Moreover the
Spanish fashion in the West Indies at least though not in the ships
of the Great Armada was for the sake of carrying merchandise to build
their menofwar flushdecked or as it was called race razes which
left those on deck exposed and open while the English fashion was to
heighten the ship as much as possible at stem and stern both by
the sweep of her lines and also by stockades close fights and
cageworks on the poop and forecastle thus giving to the men
a shelter which was further increased by strong bulkheads
cobridgeheads across the maindeck below dividing the ship thus
into a number of separate forts fitted with swivels bases fowlers
and murderers and loopholed for musketry and arrows

But the great source of superiority was after all in the men
themselves The English sailor was then as now a quite amphibious
and allcunning animal capable of turning his hand to everything from
needlework and carpentry to gunnery or handtohand blows and he
was moreover one of a nation every citizen of which was not merely
permitted to carry arms but compelled by law to practise from
childhood the use of the bow and accustomed to consider swordplay
and quarterstaff as a necessary part and parcel of education and the
pastime of every leisure hour The fiercest nation upon earth as
they were then called and the freest also each man of them fought for
himself with the selfhelp and selfrespect of a Yankee ranger and once
bidden to do his work was trusted to carry it out by his own wit as
best he could In one word he was a free man

The English officers too as now lived on terms of sympathy with their
men unknown to the Spaniards who raised between the commander and the
commanded absurd barriers of rank and blood which forbade to his pride
any labor but that of fighting The English officers on the other hand
brought up to the same athletic sports the same martial exercises as
their men were not ashamed to care for them to win their friendship
even on emergency to consult their judgment and used their rank not to
differ from their men but to outvie them not merely to command and be
obeyed but like Homers heroes or the old Norse Vikings to lead and
be followed Drake touched the true mainspring of English success when
he once in his voyage round the world indignantly rebuked some coxcomb
gentlemenadventurers withI should like to see the gentleman that
will refuse to set his hand to a rope I must have the gentlemen to hale
and draw with the mariners But those were days in which her majestys
service was as little overridden by absurd rules of seniority as by
that etiquette which is at once the counterfeit and the ruin of true
discipline Under Elizabeth and her ministers a brave and a shrewd man
was certain of promotion let his rank or his age be what they might
the true honor of knighthood covered once and for all any lowliness of
birth and the merchant service in which all the best seacaptains
even those of noble blood were more or less engaged was then a
nursery not only for seamen but for warriors in days when Spanish
and Portuguese traders whenever they had a chance got rid of English
competition by salvos of cannonshot

Hence as I have said that strong fellowfeeling between officers and
men and hence mutinies as Sir Richard Hawkins tells us were all but
unknown in the English ships while in the Spanish they broke out on
every slight occasion For the Spaniards by some suicidal pedantry had
allowed their navy to be crippled by the same despotism etiquette
and official routine by which the whole nation was gradually frozen to
death in the course of the next century or two forgetting that fifty
years before Cortez Pizarro and the early Conquistadores of America
had achieved their miraculous triumphs on the exactly opposite method
by that very fellowfeeling between commander and commanded by which the
English were now conquering them in their turn

Their navy was organized on a plan complete enough but on one which
was as the event proved utterly fatal to their prowess and unanimity
and which made even their courage and honor useless against the assaults
of free men They do in their armadas at sea divide themselves into
three bodies to wit soldiers mariners and gunners The soldiers and
officers watch and ward as if on shore and this is the only duty they
undergo except cleaning their arms wherein they are not over curious
The gunners are exempted from all labor and care except about the
artillery and these are either Almaines Flemings or strangers for
the Spaniards are but indifferently practised in this art The mariners
are but as slaves to the rest to moil and to toil day and night and
those but few and bad and not suffered to sleep or harbor under the
decks For in fair or foul weather in storms sun or rain they must
pass void of covert or succor

This is the account of one who was long prisoner on board their ships
let it explain itself while I return to my tale For the great ship is
now within two musketshots of the Rose with the golden flag of Spain
floating at her poop and her trumpets are shouting defiance up the
breeze from a dozen brazen throats which two or three answer lustily
from the Rose from whose poop flies the flag of England and from her
fore the arms of Leigh and Cary side by side and over them the ship and
bridge of the good town of Bideford And then Amyas calls

Now silence trumpets waits play up Fortune my foe and God and
the Queen be with us

Whereon laugh not reader for it was the fashion of those musical
as well as valiant days up rose that noble old favorite of good Queen
Bess from cornet and sackbut fife and drum while Parson Jack who had
taken his stand with the musicians on the poop worked away lustily at
his violin and like Volker of the Nibelungen Lied

Well played Jack thy elbow flies like a lambs tail said Amyas
forcing a jest

It shall fly to a better fiddlebow presently sir an I have the
luck

Steady helm said Amyas What is he after now

The Spaniard who had been coming upon them right down the wind under a
press of sail took in his light canvas

He dont know what to make of our waiting for him so bold said the
helmsman

He does though and means to fight us cried another See he is
hauling up the foot of his mainsail but he wants to keep the wind of
us

Let him try then quoth Amyas Keep her closer still Let no one
fire till we are about Man the starboard guns to starboard and wait
all small arm men Pass the order down to the gunner and bid all fire
high and take the rigging

Bang went one of the Spaniards bow guns and the shot went wide
Then another and another while the men fidgeted about looking at the
priming of their muskets and loosened their arrows in the sheaf

Lie down men and sing a psalm When I want you Ill call you Closer
still if you can helmsman and we will try a short ship against a long
one We can sail two points nearer the wind than he

As Amyas had calculated the Spaniard would gladly enough have stood
across the Roses bows but knowing the English readiness dare not for
fear of being raked so her only plan if she did not intend to shoot
past her foe down to leeward was to put her head close to the wind and
wait for her on the same tack

Amyas laughed to himself Hold on yet awhile More ways of killing a
cat than choking her with cream Drew there are your men ready

Ay ay sir and on they went closing fast with the Spaniard till
within a pistolshot

Ready about and about she went like an eel and ran upon the opposite
tack right under the Spaniards stern The Spaniard astounded at the
quickness of the manoeuvre hesitated a moment and then tried to get
about also as his only chance but it was too late and while his
lumbering length was still hanging in the winds eye Amyass bowsprit
had all but scraped his quarter and the Rose passed slowly across his
stern at ten yards distance

Now then roared Amyas Fire and with a will Have at her
archers have at her muskets all and in an instant a storm of bar and
chainshot round and canister swept the proud Don from stem to stern
while through the white cloud of smoke the musketballs and the still
deadlier clothyard arrows whistled and rushed upon their venomous
errand Down went the steersman and every soul who manned the
poop Down went the mizzen topmast in went the sternwindows and
quartergalleries and as the smoke cleared away the gorgeous painting
of the Madre Dolorosa with her heart full of seven swords which in
a gilded frame bedizened the Spanish stern was shivered in splinters
while most glorious of all the golden flag of Spain which the last
moment flaunted above their heads hung trailing in the water The ship
her tiller shot away and her helmsman killed staggered helplessly a
moment and then fell up into the wind

Well done men of Devon shouted Amyas as cheers rent the welkin

She has struck cried some as the deafening hurrahs died away

Not a bit said Amyas Hold on helmsman and leave her to patch her
tackle while we settle the galleys

On they shot merrily and long ere the armada could get herself to
rights again were two good miles to windward with the galleys sweeping
down fast upon them

And two venomouslooking craft they were as they shot through the
short chopping sea upon some forty oars apiece stretching their long
swordfish snouts over the water as if snuffing for their prey Behind
this long snout a strong square forecastle was crammed with soldiers
and the muzzles of cannon grinned out through portholes not only in the
sides of the forecastle but forward in the line of the galleys course
thus enabling her to keep up a continual fire on a ship right ahead

The long low waist was packed full of the slaves some five or six to
each oar and down the centre between the two banks the English could
see the slavedrivers walking up and down a long gangway whip in hand
A raised quarterdeck at the stern held more soldiers the sunlight
flashing merrily upon their armor and their gunbarrels as they neared
the English could hear plainly the cracks of the whips and the yells as
of wild beasts which answered them the roll and rattle of the oars
and the loud Ha of the slaves which accompanied every stroke and the
oaths and curses of the drivers while a sickening musky smell as of
a pack of kennelled hounds came down the wind from off those dens of
misery No wonder if many a young heart shuddered as it faced for the
first time the horrible reality of those floating hells the cruelties
whereof had rung so often in English ears from the stories of their own
countrymen who had passed them fought them and now and then passed
years of misery on board of them Who knew but what there might be
English among those sunbrowned halfnaked masses of panting wretches

Must we fire upon the slaves asked more than one as the thought
crossed him

Amyas sighed

Spare them all you can in Gods name but if they try to run us down
rake them we must and God forgive us

The two galleys came on abreast of each other some forty yards apart
To outmanoeuvre their oars as he had done the ships sails Amyas knew
was impossible To run from them was to be caught between them and the
ship

He made up his mind as usual to the desperate game

Lay her head up in the wind helmsman and we will wait for them

They were now within musketshot and opened fire from their bowguns
but owing to the chopping sea their aim was wild Amyas as usual
withheld his fire

The men stood at quarters with compressed lips not knowing what was
to come next Amyas towering motionless on the quarterdeck gave his
orders calmly and decisively The men saw that he trusted himself and
trusted him accordingly

The Spaniards seeing him wait for them gave a shout of joywas the
Englishman mad And the two galleys converged rapidly intending to
strike him full one on each bow

They were within forty yardsanother minute and the shock would come
The Englishmans helm went up his yards creaked round and gathering
way he plunged upon the larboard galley

A dozen gold nobles to him who brings down the steersman shouted
Cary who had his cue

And a flight of arrows from the forecastle rattled upon the galleys
quarterdeck

Hit or not hit the steersman lost his nerve and shrank from the coming
shock The galleys helm went up to port and her beak slid all but
harmless along Amyass bow a long dull grind and then loud crack on
crack as the Rose sawed slowly through the bank of oars from stem to
stern hurling the wretched slaves in heaps upon each other and ere
her mate on the other side could swing round to strike him in his new
position Amyass whole broadside great and small had been poured into
her at pistolshot answered by a yell which rent their ears and hearts

Spare the slaves Fire at the soldiers cried Amyas but the work was
too hot for much discrimination for the larboard galley crippled
but not undaunted swung round across his stern and hooked herself
venomously on to him

It was a move more brave than wise for it prevented the other galley
from returning to the attack without exposing herself a second time to
the English broadside and a desperate attempt of the Spaniards to board
at once through the sternports and up the quarter was met with such a
demurrer of shot and steel that they found themselves in three minutes
again upon the galleys poop accompanied to their intense disgust by
Amyas Leigh and twenty English swords

Five minutes hard cutting hand to hand and the poop was clear The
soldiers in the forecastle had been able to give them no assistance
open as they lay to the arrows and musketry from the Roses lofty stern
Amyas rushed along the central gangway shouting in Spanish Freedom
to the slaves death to the masters clambered into the forecastle
followed close by his swarm of wasps and set them so good an example
how to use their stings that in three minutes more there was not a
Spaniard on board who was not dead or dying

Let the slaves free shouted he Throw us a hammer down men Hark
theres an English voice

There is indeed From amid the wreck of broken oars and writhing limbs
a voice is shrieking in broadest Devon to the master who is looking
over the side

Oh Robert Drew Robert Drew Come down and take me out of hell

Who be you in the name of the Lord

Dont you mind William Prust that Captain Hawkins left behind in the
Honduras years and years agone Theres nine of us aboard if your shot
hasnt put em out of their misery Come down if youve a Christian
heart come down

Utterly forgetful of all discipline Drew leaps down hammer in hand and
the two old comrades rush into each others arms

Why make a long story of what took but five minutes to do The nine men
luckily none of them wounded are freed and helped on board to be
hugged and kissed by old comrades and young kinsmen while the remaining
slaves furnished with a couple of hammers are told to free themselves
and help the English The wretches answer by a shout and Amyas once
more safe on board again dashes after the other galley which has
been hovering out of reach of his guns but there is no need to trouble
himself about her sickened with what she has got she is struggling
right up wind leaning over to one side and seemingly ready to sink

Are there any English on board of her asks Amyas loath to lose the
chance of freeing a countryman

Never a one sir thank God

So they set to work to repair damages while the liberated slaves
having shifted some of the galleys oars pull away after their comrade
and that with such a will that in ten minutes they have caught her up
and careless of the Spaniards fire boarded her en masse with yells
as of a thousand wolves There will be fearful vengeance taken on those
tyrants unless they play the man this day

And in the meanwhile half the crew are clothing feeding questioning
caressing those nine poor fellows thus snatched from living death
and Yeo hearing the news has rushed up on deck to welcome his old
comrades and

Is Michael Heard my cousin here among you

Yes Michael Heard is there whiteheaded rather from misery than age
and the embracings and questionings begin afresh

Where is my wife Salvation Yeo

With the Lord

Amen says the old man with a short shudder I thought so much and
my two boys

With the Lord

The old man catches Yeo by the arm

How then It is Yeos turn to shudder now

Killed in Panama fighting the Spaniards sailing with Mr Oxenham and
twas I led em into it May God and you forgive me

They couldnt die better cousin Yeo Wheres my girl Grace

Died in childbed

Any childer

No

The old man covers his face with his hands for a while

Well Ive been alone with the Lord these fifteen years so I must not
whine at being alone a while longert wont be long

Put this coat on your back uncle says some one

No no coats for me Naked came I into the world and naked I go out of
it this day if I have a chance Youm better to go to your work lads
or the big one will have the wind of you yet

So she will said Amyas who has overheard but so great is the
curiosity on all hands that he has some trouble in getting the men
to quarters again indeed they only go on condition of parting among
themselves with them the newcomers each to tell his sad and strange
story How after Captain Hawkins constrained by famine had put them
ashore they wandered in misery till the Spaniards took them how
instead of hanging them as they at first intended the Dons fed and
clothed them and allotted them as servants to various gentlemen about
Mexico where they throve turned their hands like true sailors to all
manner of trades and made much money and some of them were married
even to women of wealth so that all went well until the fatal year
1574 when much against the minds of many of the Spaniards themselves
that cruel and bloody Inquisition was established for the first time in
the Indies and how from that moment their lives were one long
tragedy how they were all imprisoned for a year and a half not for
proselytizing but simply for not believing in transubstantiation
racked again and again and at last adjudged to receive publicly on
Good Friday 1575 some three hundred some one hundred stripes and to
serve in the galleys for six or ten years each while as the crowning
atrocity of the Moloch sacrifice three of them were burnt alive in the
marketplace of Mexico a story no less hideous than true the details
whereof whoso list may read in Hakluyts third volume as told by
Philip Miles one of that hapless crew as well as the adventures of Job
Hortop a messmate of his who after being sent to Spain and seeing
two more of his companions burnt alive at Seville was sentenced to
row in the galleys ten years and after that to go to the everlasting
prison remediless from which doom after twentythree years of
slavery he was delivered by the galleon Dudley and came safely home to
Redriff

The fate of Hortop and his comrades was of course still unknown to
the rescued men but the history even of their party was not likely to
improve the good feeling of the crew toward the Spanish ship which was
two miles to leeward of them and which must be fought with or fled
from before a quarter of an hour was past So kneeling down upon the
deck as many a brave crew in those days did in like case they gave
God thanks devoutly for the favor they had found and then with one
accord at Jacks leading sang one and all the Ninetyfourth Psalm

 Oh Lord thou dost revenge all wrong
 Vengeance belongs to thee etc

  The crew of the Tobie cast away on the Barbary coast a
 few years after began with heavy hearts to sing the
 twelfth Psalm Help Lord for good and godly men etc
 Howbeit ere we had finished four verses the waves of the
 sea had stopped the breaths of most

And then again to quarters for half the days work or more than half
still remained to be done and hardly were the decks cleared afresh
and the damage repaired as best it could be when she came ranging up to
leeward as closehauled as she could

She was as I said a long flushdecked ship of full five hundred tons
more than double the size in fact of the Rose though not so lofty in
proportion and many a bold heart beat loud and no shame to them as
she began firing away merrily determined as all well knew to wipe out
in English blood the disgrace of her late foil

Never mind my merry masters said Amyas she has quantity and we
quality

Thats true said one for one honest man is worth two rogues

And one culverin three of their footy little ordnance said another
So when you will captain and have at her

Let her come abreast of us and dont burn powder We have the wind
and can do what we like with her Serve the men out a horn of ale all
round steward and all take your time

So they waited for five minutes more and then set to work quietly
after the fashion of English mastiffs though like those mastiffs they
waxed right mad before three rounds were fired and the white splinters
sight beloved began to crackle and fly

Amyas having as he had said the wind and being able to go nearer it
than the Spaniard kept his place at easy pointblank range for his two
eighteenpounder culverins which Yeo and his mate worked with terrible
effect

We are lacking her through and through every shot said he Leave the
small ordnance alone yet awhile and we shall sink her without them

Whing whing went the Spaniards shot like so many hummingtops
through the rigging far above their heads for the illconstructed
ports of those days prevented the guns from hulling an enemy who was to
windward unless close alongside

Blow jolly breeze cried one and lay the Don over all thou
canstWhat the murrain is gone aloft there

Alas a crack a flap a rattle and blank dismay An unlucky shot had
cut the foremast already wounded in two and all forward was a mass of
dangling wreck

Forward and cut away the wreck said Amyas unmoved Small arm men
be ready He will be aboard of us in five minutes

It was too true The Rose unmanageable from the loss of her headsail
lay at the mercy of the Spaniard and the archers and musqueteers had
hardly time to range themselves to leeward when the Madre Dolorosas
chains were grinding against the Roses and grapples tossed on board
from stem to stern

Dont cut them loose roared Amyas Let them stay and see the fun
Now dogs of Devon show your teeth and hurrah for God and the queen

And then began a fight most fierce and fell the Spaniards according to
their fashion attempting to board the English amid fierce shouts of
God and the queen God and St George for England sweeping them
back by showers of arrows and musquet balls thrusting them down with
pikes hurling grenades and stinkpots from the tops while the swivels
on both sides poured their grape and bar and chain and the great
maindeck guns thundering muzzle to muzzle made both ships quiver and
recoil as they smashed the round shot through and through each other

So they roared and flashed fast clenched to each other in that devils
wedlock under a cloud of smoke beneath the cloudless tropic sky while
all around the dolphins gambolled and the flyingfish shot on from
swell to swell and the rainbowhued jellies opened and shut their cups
of living crystal to the sun as merrily as if man had never fallen and
hell had never broken loose on earth

So it raged for an hour or more till all arms were weary and all
tongues clove to the mouth And sick men rotting with scurvy
scrambled up on deck and fought with the strength of madness and tiny
powderboys handing up cartridges from the hold laughed and cheered
as the shots ran past their ears and old Salvation Yeo a text upon his
lips and a fury in his heart as of Joshua or Elijah in old time worked
on calm and grim but with the energy of a boy at play And now and
then an opening in the smoke showed the Spanish captain in his suit
of black steel armor standing cool and proud guiding and pointing
careless of the iron hail but too lofty a gentleman to soil his glove
with aught but a knightly swordhilt while Amyas and Will after the
fashion of the English gentlemen had stripped themselves nearly as bare
as their own sailors and were cheering thrusting hewing and hauling
here there and everywhere like any common mariner and filling them
with a spirit of selfrespect fellowfeeling and personal daring
which the discipline of the Spaniards more perfect mechanically but
cold and tyrannous and crushing spiritually never could bestow The
blackplumed senor was obeyed but the goldenlocked Amyas was followed
and would have been followed through the jaws of hell

The Spaniards ere five minutes had passed poured en masse into the
Roses waist but only to their destruction Between the poop and
forecastle as was then the fashion the upperdeck beams were left open
and unplanked with the exception of a narrow gangway on either side
and off that fatal ledge the boarders thrust on by those behind fell
headlong between the beams to the maindeck below to be slaughtered
helpless in that pit of destruction by the double fire from the
bulkheads fore and aft while the few who kept their footing on
the gangway after vain attempts to force the stockades on poop and
forecastle leaped overboard again amid a shower of shot and arrows
The fire of the English was as steady as it was quick and though
threefourths of the crew had never smelt powder before they proved
well the truth of the old chroniclers saying since proved again more
gloriously than ever at Alma Balaklava and Inkerman that the
English never fight better than in their first battle

Thrice the Spaniards clambered on board and thrice surged back before
that deadly hail The decks on both sides were very shambles and Jack
Brimblecombe who had fought as long as his conscience would allow him
found when he turned to a more clerical occupation enough to do in
carrying poor wretches to the surgeon without giving that spiritual
consolation which he longed to give and they to receive At last there
was a lull in that wild storm No shot was heard from the Spaniards
upperdeck

Amyas leaped into the mizzen rigging and looked through the smoke Dead
men he could descry through the blinding veil rolled in heaps laid
flat dead men and dying but no man upon his feet The last volley had
swept the deck clear one by one had dropped below to escape that
fiery shower and alone at the helm grinding his teeth with rage his
mustachios curling up to his very eyes stood the Spanish captain

Now was the moment for a counterstroke Amyas shouted for the boarders
and in two minutes more he was over the side and clutching at the
Spaniards mizzen rigging

What was this The distance between him and the enemys side was
widening Was she sheering off Yesand rising too growing bodily
higher every moment as if by magic Amyas looked up in astonishment and
saw what it was The Spaniard was heeling fast over to leeward away from
him Her masts were all sloping forward swifter and swifterthe end
was come then

Back in Gods name back men She is sinking by the head And with
much ado some were dragged back some leaped backall but old Michael
Heard

With hair and beard floating in the wind the bronzed naked figure
like some weird old Indian fakir still climbed on steadfastly up the
mizzenchains of the Spaniard hatchet in hand

Come back Michael Leap while you may shouted a dozen voices
Michael turned

And what should I come back for then to go home where no one knoweth
me Ill die like an Englishman this day or Ill know the rason why
and turning he sprang in over the bulwarks as the huge ship rolled
up more and more like a dying whale exposing all her long black
hulk almost down to the keel and one of her lowerdeck guns as if in
defiance exploded upright into the air hurling the ball to the very
heavens

In an instant it was answered from the Rose by a column of smoke and
the eighteenpound ball crashed through the bottom of the defenceless
Spaniard

Who fired Shame to fire on a sinking ship

Gunner Yeo sir shouted a voice up from the maindeck Hes like a
madman down here

Tell him if he fires again Ill put him in irons if he were my own
brother Cut away the grapples aloft men Dont you see how she drags
us over Cut away or we shall sink with her

They cut away and the Rose released from the strain shook her
feathers on the wavecrest like a freed seagull while all men held
their breaths

Suddenly the glorious creature righted herself and rose again as if in
noble shame for one last struggle with her doom Her bows were deep in
the water but her afterdeck still dry Righted but only for a moment
long enough to let her crew come pouring wildly up on deck with cries
and prayers and rush aft to the poop where under the flag of Spain
stood the tall captain his left hand on the standardstaff his sword
pointed in his right

Back men they heard him cry and die like valiant mariners

Some of them ran to the bulwarks and shouted Mercy We surrender and
the English broke into a cheer and called to them to run her alongside

Silence shouted Amyas I take no surrender from mutineers Senor
cried he to the captain springing into the rigging and taking off his
hat for the love of God and these men strike and surrender a buena
querra

The Spaniard lifted his hat and bowed courteously and answered
Impossible senor No querra is good which stains my honor

God have mercy on you then

Amen said the Spaniard crossing himself

She gave one awful lounge forward and dived under the coming swell
hurling her crew into the eddies Nothing but the point of her poop
remained and there stood the stern and steadfast Don capapie in his
glistening black armor immovable as a man of iron while over him the
flag which claimed the empire of both worlds flaunted its gold aloft
and upwards in the glare of the tropic noon

He shall not carry that flag to the devil with him I will have it
yet if I die for it said Will Cary and rushed to the side to leap
overboard but Amyas stopped him

Let him die as he has lived with honor

A wild figure sprang out of the mass of sailors who struggled and
shrieked amid the foam and rushed upward at the Spaniard It was
Michael Heard The Don who stood above him plunged his sword into the
old mans body but the hatchet gleamed nevertheless down went the
blade through headpiece and through head and as Heard sprang onward
bleeding but alive the steelclad corpse rattled down the deck into
the surge Two more strokes struck with the fury of a dying man and
the standardstaff was hewn through Old Michael collected all his
strength hurled the flag far from the sinking ship and then stood
erect one moment and shouted God save Queen Bess and the English
answered with a Hurrah which rent the welkin

Another moment and the gulf had swallowed his victim and the poop and
him and nothing remained of the Madre Dolorosa but a few floating spars
and struggling wretches while a great awe fell upon all men and a
solemn silence broken only by the cry

 Of some strong swimmer in his agony

And then suddenly collecting themselves as men awakened from a dream
halfadozen desperate gallants reckless of sharks and eddies leaped
overboard swam towards the flag and towed it alongside in triumph

Ah said Salvation Yeo as he helped the trophy up over the side ah
it was not for nothing that we found poor Michael He was always a good
comradenigh as good a one as William Penberthy of Marazion whom the
Lord grant I meet in bliss And now then my masters shall we inshore
again and burn La Guayra

Art thou never glutted with Spanish blood thou old wolf asked Will
Cary

Never sir answered Yeo

To St Jago be it said Amyas if we can get there butGod help
us

And he looked round sadly enough while no one needed that he should
finish his sentence or explain his but

The foremast was gone the mainyard sprung the rigging hanging in
elflocks the hull shot through and through in twenty places the deck
strewn with the bodies of nine good men beside sixteen wounded down
below while the pitiless sun right above their heads poured down a
flood of fire upon a sea of glass

And it would have been well if faintness and weariness had been all that
was the matter but now that the excitement was over the collapse came
and the men sat down listlessly and sulkily by twos and threes upon the
deck starting and wincing when they heard some poor fellow below cry
out under the surgeons knife or murmuring to each other that all was
lost Drew tried in vain to rouse them telling them that all depended
on rigging a jurymast forward as soon as possible They answered only
by growls and at last broke into open reproaches Even Will Carys
volatile nature which had kept him up during the fight gave way when
Yeo and the carpenter came aft and told Amyas in a low voice

We are hit somewhere forward below the waterline sir She leaks a
terrible deal and the Lord will not vouchsafe to us to lay our hands on
the place for all our searching

What are we to do now Amyas in the devils name asked Cary
peevishly

What are we to do in Gods name rather answered Amyas in a low
voice Will Will what did God make you a gentleman for but to know
better than those poor fickle fellows forward who blow hot and cold at
every change of weather

I wish youd come forward and speak to them sir said Yeo who had
overheard the last words or we shall get naught done

Amyas went forward instantly

Now then my brave lads whats the matter here that you are all
sitting on your tails like monkeys

Ugh grunts one Dont you think our days work has been long enough
yet captain

You dont want us to go in to La Guayra again sir There are enough of
us thrown away already I reckon about that wench there

Best sit here and sink quietly Theres no getting home again thats
plain

Why were we brought out here to be killed

For shame men cries Yeo youre no better than a set of
stiffnecked Hebrew Jews murmuring against Moses the very minute after
the Lord has delivered you from the Egyptians

Now I do not wish to set Amyas up as a perfect man for he had his
faults like every one else nor as better thank God than many and
many a brave and virtuous captain in her majestys service at this very
day but certainly he behaved admirably under that trial Drake had
trained him as he trained many another excellent officer to be as
stout in discipline and as dogged of purpose as he himself was but
he had trained him also to feel with and for his men to make allowances
for them and to keep his temper with them as he did this day True he
had seen Drake in a rage he had seen him hang one man for a mutiny
and that man his dearest friend and threaten to hang thirty more
but Amyas remembered well that that explosion took place when having as
Drake said publicly himself taken in hand that I know not in the world
how to go through with it passeth my capacity it hath even bereaved
me of my wits to think of it    and having now set together by
the ears three mighty princes her majesty and the kings of Spain
and Portugal he found his whole voyage ready to come to naught by
mutinies and discords controversy between the sailors and gentlemen
and stomaching between the gentlemen and sailors But my masters
quoth the selftrained hero and Amyas never forgot his words I must
have it left for I must have the gentlemen to haul and draw with the
mariner and the mariner with the gentlemen I would like to know him
that would refuse to set his hand to a rope

And now Amyass conscience smote him and his simple and pious soul took
the loss of his brother as Gods verdict on his conduct because he had
set his own private affection even his own private revenge before the
safety of his ships company and the good of his country

Ah said he to himself as he listened to his mens reproaches if
I had been thinking like a loyal soldier of serving my queen and
crippling the Spaniard I should have taken that great bark three days
ago and in it the very man I sought

So choking down his old man as Yeo used to say he made answer
cheerfully

Pooh pooh brave lads For shame for shame You were lions
halfanhour ago you are not surely turned sheep already Why but
yesterday evening you were grumbling because I would not run in and
fight those three ships under the batteries of La Guayra and now
you think it too much to have fought them fairly out at sea What has
happened but the chances of war which might have happened anywhere
Nothing venture nothing win and nobody goes birdnesting without a
fall at times If any one wants to be safe in this life hed best stay
at home and keep his bed though even there who knows but the roof
might fall through on him

Ah its all very well for you captain said some grumbling younker
with a vague notion that Amyas must be better off than he because he
was a gentleman Amyass blood rose

Yes sirrah it is very well for me as long as God is with me but He
is with every man in this ship I would have you to know as much as
He is with me Do you fancy that I have nothing to lose I who have
adventured in this voyage all I am worth and more who if I fail must
return to beggary and scorn And if I have ventured rashly sinfully
if you will the lives of any of you in my own private quarrel am I not
punished Have I not lost

His voice trembled and stopped there but he recovered himself in a
moment

Pish I cant stand here chattering Carpenter an axe and help me to
cast these spars loose Get out of my way there lumbering the scuppers
up like so many moulting fowls Here all old friends lend a hand
Pelicans men stand by your captain Did we sail round the world for
nothing

This last appeal struck home and up leaped halfadozen of the old
Pelicans and set to work at his side manfully to rig the jurymast

Come along cried Cary to the malcontents were raw longshore
fellows but we wont be outdone by any old seadog of them all And
setting to work himself he was soon followed by one and another till
order and work went on well enough

And where are we going when the masts up shouted some saucy hand
from behind

Where you darent follow us alone by yourself so you had better keep
us company replied Yeo

Ill tell you where we are going lads said Amyas rising from his
work Like it or leave it as you will I have no secrets from my crew
We are going inshore there to find a harbor and careen the ship

There was a start and a murmur

Inshore Into the Spaniards mouths

All in the Inquisition in a weeks time

Better stay here and be drowned

Youre right in that last shouts Cary Thats the right death for
blind puppies Look you I dont know in the least where we are and I
hardly know stem from stern aboard ship and the captain may be right or
wrongthats nothing to me but this I know that I am a soldier and
will obey orders and where he goes I go and whosoever hinders me must
walk up my sword to do it

Amyas pressed Carys hand and then

And heres my broadside next men Ill go nowhere and do nothing
without the advice of Salvation Yeo and Robert Drew and if any man in
the ship knows better than these two let him up and well give him a
hearing Eh Pelicans

There was a grunt of approbation from the Pelicans and Amyas returned
to the charge

We have five shot between wind and water and one somewhere below Can
we face a gale of wind in that state or can we not

Silence

Can we get home with a leak in our bottom

Silence

Then what can we do but run inshore and take our chance Speak Its
a cowards trick to do nothing because what we must do is not pleasant
Will you be like children that would sooner die than take nasty physic
or will you not

Silence still

Come along now Heres the wind again round with the sun and up to the
northwest In with her

Sulkily enough but unable to deny the necessity the men set to work
and the vessels head was put toward the land but when she began to
slip through the water the leak increased so fast that they were kept
hard at work at the pumps for the rest of the afternoon

The current had by this time brought them abreast of the bay of
Higuerote and luckily for them safe out of the short heavy swell
which it causes round Cape Codera Looking inland they had now to the
southwest that noble headland backed by the Caracas Mountains range
on range up to the Silla and the Neguater while right ahead of them
to the south the shore sank suddenly into a low line of mangrovewood
backed by primaeval forest As they ran inward all eyes were strained
greedily to find some opening in the mangrove belt but none was to
be seen for some time The lead was kept going and every fresh heave
announced shallower water

We shall have very shoal work off those mangroves Yeo said Amyas I
doubt whether we shall do aught now unless we find a rivers mouth

If the Lord thinks a river good for us sir Hell show us one So on
they went keeping a southeast course and at last an opening in the
mangrove belt was hailed with a cheer from the older hands though
the majority shrugged their shoulders as men going openeyed to
destruction

Off the mouth they sent in Drew and Cary with a boat and watched
anxiously for an hour The boat returned with a good report of two
fathoms of water over the bar impenetrable forests for two miles up
the river sixty yards broad and no sign of man The rivers banks were
soft and sloping mud fit for careening

Safe quarters sir said Yeo privately as far as Spaniards go I
hope in God it may be as safe from calentures and fevers

Beggars must not be choosers said Amyas So in they went

They towed the ship up about halfamile to a point where she could not
be seen from the seaward and there moored her to the mangrovestems
Amyas ordered a boat out and went up the river himself to reconnoitre
He rowed some three miles till the river narrowed suddenly and was all
but covered in by the interlacing boughs of mighty trees There was no
sign that man had been there since the making of the world

He dropped down the stream again thoughtfully and sadly How many years
ago was it that he passed this rivers mouth Three days And yet how
much had passed in them Don Guzman found and lostRose found and
losta great victory gained and yet lostperhaps his ship lostabove
all his brother lost

Lost O God how should he find his brother

Some strange bird out of the woods made mournful answerNever never
never

How should he face his mother

Never never never wailed the bird again and Amyas smiled bitterly
and said Never likewise

The night mist began to steam and wreathe upon the foul beercolored
stream The loathy floor of liquid mud lay bare beneath the mangrove
forest Upon the endless web of interarching roots great purple crabs
were crawling up and down They would have supped with pleasure upon
Amyass corpse perhaps they might sup on him after all for a heavy
sickening graveyard smell made his heart sink within him and his
stomach heave and his weary body and more weary soul gave themselves
up helplessly to the depressing influence of that doleful place
The black bank of dingy leathern leaves above his head the endless
labyrinth of stems and withes for every bough had lowered its own
living cord to take fresh hold of the foul soil below the web of
roots which stretched away inland till it was lost in the shades of
eveningall seemed one horrid complicated trap for him and his and
even where here and there he passed the mouth of a lagoon there was
no opening no reliefnothing but the dark ring of mangroves and here
and there an isolated group of large and small parents and children
breeding and spreading as if in hideous haste to choke out air and sky
Wailing sadly sadcolored mangrovehens ran off across the mud into the
dreary dark The hoarse nightraven hid among the roots startled the
voyagers with a sudden shout and then all was again silent as a grave
The loathly alligators lounging in the slime lifted their horny
eyelids lazily and leered upon him as he passed with stupid savageness
Lines of tall herons stood dimly in the growing gloom like white
fantastic ghosts watching the passage of the doomed boat All was foul
sullen weird as witches dream If Amyas had seen a crew of skeletons
glide down the stream behind him with Satan standing at the helm he
would have scarcely been surprised What fitter craft could haunt that
Stygian flood

That night every man of the boats crew save Amyas was down with
raging fever before ten the next morning five more men were taken and
others sickening fast



CHAPTER XXI

HOW THEY TOOK THE COMMUNION UNDER THE TREE AT HIGUEROTE

 Follow thee Follow thee Wha wad na follow thee Lang hast
 thou looed and trusted us fairly

Amyas would have certainly taken the yellow fever but for one reason
which he himself gave to Cary He had no time to be sick while his men
were sick a valid and sufficient reason as many a noble soul in
the Crimea has known too well as long as the excitement of work is
present but too apt to fail the hero and to let him sink into the pit
which he has so often overleapt the moment that his work is done

He called a council of war or rather a sanitary commission the
next morning for he was fairly at his wits end The men were
panicstricken ready to mutiny Amyas told them that he could not see
any possible good which could accrue to them by killing him orfor
there were two sides to every questionbeing killed by him and then
went below to consult The doctor talked mere science or nonscience
about humors complexions and animal spirits Jack Brimblecombe mere
pulpit about its being the visitation of God Cary mere despair
though he jested over it with a smile Yeo mere stoic fatalism though
he quoted Scripture to back the same Drew the master had nothing to
say His business was to sail the ship and not to cure calentures

Whereon Amyas clutched his locks according to custom and at last broke
forthDoctor a fig for your humors and complexions Can you cure
a mans humors or change his complexion Can an Ethiopian change his
skin or a leopard his spots Dont shove off your ignorance on God
sir I ask you whats the reason of this sickness and you dont know
Jack Brimblecombe dont talk to me about Gods visitation this looks
much more like the devils visitation to my mind We are doing Gods
work Sir John and He is not likely to hinder us So down with the
devil say I Cary laughing killed the cat but it wont cure a
Christian Yeo when an angel tells me that its Gods will that we
should all die like dogs in a ditch Ill call this Gods will but not
before Drew you say your business is to sail the ship then sail her
out of this infernal poisontrap this very morning if you can which
you cant The mischiefs in the air and nowhere else I felt it run
through me coming down last night and smelt it like any sewer and
if it was not in the air why was my boats crew taken first tell me
that

There was no answer

Then Ill tell you why they were taken first because the mist when
we came through it only rose five or six feet above the stream and we
were in it while you on board were above it And those that were taken
on board this morning every one of them slept on the maindeck and
every one of them too was in fear of the fever whereby I judge two
thingsKeep as high as you can and fear nothing but God and were
all safe yet

But the fog was up to our roundtops at sunrise this morning said
Cary

I know it but we who were on the halfdeck were not in it so long as
those below and that may have made the difference let alone our having
free air Beside I suspect the heat in the evening draws the poison out
more and that when it gets cold toward morning the venom of it goes
off somehow

How it went off Amyas could not tell right in his facts as he was for
nobody on earth knew I suppose at that day and it was not till
nearly two centuries of fatal experience that the settlers in America
discovered the simple laws of these epidemics which now every child
knows or ought to know But common sense was on his side and Yeo rose
and spoke

As I have said before many a time the Lord has sent us a very young
Daniel for judge I remember now to have heard the Spaniards say how
these calentures lay always in the low ground and never came more than
a few hundred feet above the sea

Let us go up those few hundred feet then

Every man looked at Amyas and then at his neighbor

Gentlemen Look the devil straight in the face if you would hit him
in the right place We cannot get the ship to sea as she is and if we
could we cannot go home emptyhanded and we surely cannot stay here to
die of feverWe must leave the ship and go inland

Inland answered every voice but Yeos

Up those hundred feet which Yeo talks of Up to the mountains stockade
a camp and get our sick and provisions thither

And what next

And when we are recruited march over the mountains and surprise St
Jago de Leon

Cary swore a great oath Amyas you are a daring fellow

Not a bit Its the plain path of prudence

So it is sir said old Yeo and I follow you in it

And so do I squeaked Jack Brimblecombe

Nay then Jack thou shalt not outrun me So I say yes too quoth
Cary

Mr Drew

At your service sir to live or die I know naught about stockading
but Sir Francis would have given the same counsel I verily believe if
he had been in your place

Then tell the men that we start in an hours time Win over the
Pelicans Yeo and Drew and the rest must follow like sheep over a
hedge

The Pelicans and the liberated galleyslaves joined the project at
once but the rest gave Amyas a stormy hour The great question was
where were the hills In that dense mangrove thicket they could not see
fifty yards before them

The hills are not three miles to the southwest of you at this moment
said Amyas I marked every shoulder of them as we ran in

I suppose you meant to take us there

The question set a light to a trainand angry suspicions were blazing
up one after another but Amyas silenced them with a countermine

Fools if I had not wit enow to look ahead a little farther than you
do where would you be Are you mad as well as reckless to rise against
your own captain because he has two strings to his bow Go my way I
say or as I live Ill blow up the ship and every soul on board and
save you the pain of rotting here by inches

The men knew that Amyas never said what he did not intend to do not
that Amyas intended to do this because he knew that the threat would be
enough So they agreed to go and were reassured by seeing that the old
Pelicans men turned to the work heartily and cheerfully

There is no use keeping the reader for five or six weary hours under a
broiling or rather stewing sun stumbling over mangrove roots hewing
his way through thorny thickets dragging sick men and provisions up
mountain steeps amid disappointment fatigue murmurs curses snakes
mosquitoes false alarms of Spaniards and every misery save cold
which flesh is heir to Suffice it that by sunset that evening they had
gained a level spot a full thousand feet above the sea backed by an
inaccessible cliff which formed the upper shoulder of a mighty mountain
defended below by steep wooded slopes and needing but the felling of a
few trees to make it impregnable

Amyas settled the sick under the arched roots of an enormous cottonwood
tree and made a second journey to the ship to bring up hammocks and
blankets for them while Yeos wisdom and courage were of inestimable
value He as pioneer had found the little brook up which they forced
their way he had encouraged them to climb the cliffs over which it
fell arguing rightly that on its course they were sure to find some
ground fit for encampment within the reach of water he had supported
Amyas when again and again the weary crew entreated to be dragged no
farther and had gone back again a dozen times to cheer them upward
while Cary who brought up the rear bullied and cheered on the
stragglers who sat down and refused to move drove back at the swords
point more than one who was beating a retreat carried their burdens for
them sang them songs on the halt in all things approving himself the
gallant and hopeful soul which he had always been till Amyas beside
himself with joy at finding that the two men on whom he had counted
most were utterly worthy of his trust went so far as to whisper to them
both in confidence that very night

Cortez burnt his ships when he landed Why should not we

Yeo leapt upright and then sat down again and whispered

Do you say that captain Tis from above then thats certain for
its been hanging on my mind too all day

Theres no hurry quoth Amyas we must clear her out first you
know while Cary sat silent and musing Amyas had evidently more
schemes in his head than he chose to tell

The men were too tired that evening to do much but ere the sun rose
next morning Amyas had them hard at work fortifying their position It
was as I said strong enough by nature for though it was commanded by
high cliffs on three sides yet there was no chance of an enemy coming
over the enormous mountainrange behind them and still less chance
that if he came he would discover them through the dense mass of
trees which crowned the cliff and clothed the hills for a thousand feet
above The attack if it took place would come from below and against
that Amyas guarded by felling the smaller trees and laying them with
their boughs outward over the crest of the slope thus forming an abatis
as every one who has shot in thick cover knows to his cost warranted
to bring up in two steps horse dog or man The trunks were sawn into
logs laid lengthwise and steadied by stakes and mould and three or
four hours hard work finished a stockade which would defy anything
but artillery The work done Amyas scrambled up into the boughs of the
enormous ceibatree and there sat inspecting his own handiwork looking
out far and wide over the forestcovered plains and the blue sea beyond
and thinking in his simple straightforward way of what was to be done
next

To stay there long was impossible to avenge himself upon La Guayra was
impossible to go until he had found out whether Frank was alive or dead
seemed at first equally impossible But were Brimblecombe Cary and
those eighty men to be sacrificed a second time to his private interest
Amyas wept with rage and then wept again with earnest honest prayer
before he could make up his mind But he made it up There were a
hundred chances to one that Frank was dead and if not he was equally
past their help for he wasAmyas knew that too wellby this time
in the hands of the Inquisition Who could lift him from that pit Not
Amyas at least And crying aloud in his agony God help him for I
cannot Amyas made up his mind to move But whither Many an hour he
thought and thought alone there in his airy nest and at last he went
down calm and cheerful and drew Cary and Yeo aside They could not
he said refit the ship without dying of fever during the process an
assertion which neither of his hearers was bold enough to deny Even
if they refitted her they would be pretty certain to have to fight the
Spaniards again for it was impossible to doubt the Indians story that
they had been forewarned of the Roses coming or to doubt either that
Eustace had been the traitor

Let us try St Jago then sack it come down on La Guayra in the rear
take a ship there and so get home

Nay Will If they have strengthened themselves against us at La
Guayra where they had little to lose surely they have done so at St
Jago where they have much I hear the town is large though new and
besides how can we get over these mountains without a guide

Or with one said Cary with a sigh looking up at the vast walls of
wood and rock which rose range on range for miles But it is strange to
find you at least throwing cold water on a daring plot

What if I had a still more daring one Did you ever hear of the golden
city of Manoa

Yeo laughed a grim but joyful laugh I have sir and so have the old
hands from the Pelican and the Jesus of Lubec I doubt not

So much the better and Amyas began to tell Cary all which he had
learned from the Spaniard while Yeo capped every word thereof with
rumors and traditions of his own gathering Cary sat half aghast as
the huge phantasmagoria unfolded itself before his dazzled eyes and at
last

So that was why you wanted to burn the ship Well after all nobody
needs me at home and one less at table wont be missed So you want to
play Cortez eh

We shall never need to play Cortez who was not such a bad fellow after
all Will because we shall have no such cannibal fiends tyranny to
rid the earth of as he had And I trust we shall fear God enough not to
play Pizarro

So the conversation dropped for the time but none of them forgot it

In that mountainnook the party spent some ten days and more Several of
the sick men died some from the fever superadded to their wounds
some probably from having been bled by the surgeon the others mended
steadily by the help of certain herbs which Yeo administered much
to the disgust of the doctor who of course wanted to bleed the poor
fellows all round and was all but mutinous when Amyas stayed his hand
In the meanwhile by dint of daily trips to the ship provisions
were plentiful enoughbeside the raccoons monkeys and other small
animals which Yeo and the veterans of Hawkinss crew knew how to catch
and the fruit and vegetables above all the delicious mountain cabbage
of the Areca palm and the fresh milk of the cowtree which they
brought in daily paying well thereby for the hospitality they received

All day long a careful watch was kept among the branches of the mighty
ceibatree And what a tree that was The hugest English oak would have
seemed a stunted bush beside it Borne up on roots or rather walls
of twisted board some twelve feet high between which the whole
crew their ammunitions and provisions were housed roomily rose
the enormous trunk full forty feet in girth towering like some tall
lighthouse smooth for a hundred feet then crowned with boughs each of
which was a stately tree whose topmost twigs were full two hundred
and fifty feet from the ground And yet it was easy for the sailors to
ascend so many natural ropes had kind Nature lowered for their use in
the smooth lianes which hung to the very earth often without a knot or
leaf Once in the tree you were within a new world suspended between
heaven and earth and as Cary said no wonder if like Jack when he
climbed the magic beanstalk you had found a castle a giant and a few
acres of wellstocked park packed away somewhere amid that labyrinth of
timber Flowergardens at least were there in plenty for every limb was
covered with pendent cactuses gorgeous orchises and wild pines and
while onehalf the tree was clothed in rich foliage the other half
utterly leafless bore on every twig brilliant yellow flowers around
which hummingbirds whirred all day long Parrots peeped in and out of
every cranny while within the airy woodland brilliant lizards basked
like living gems upon the bark gaudy finches flitted and chirruped
butterflies of every size and color hovered over the topmost twigs
innumerable insects hummed from morn till eve and when the sun went
down treetoads came out to snore and croak till dawn There was more
life round that one tree than in a whole square mile of English soil

And Amyas as he lounged among the branches felt at moments as if he
would be content to stay there forever and feed his eyes and ears
with all its wondersand then started sighing from his dream as he
recollected that a few days must bring the foe upon them and force
him to decide upon some scheme at which the bravest heart might falter
without shame So there he sat for he often took the scouts place
himself looking out over the fantastic tropic forest at his feet
and the flat mangroveswamps below and the white sheet of foamflecked
blue and yet no sail appeared and the men as their fear of fever
subsided began to ask when they would go down and refit the ship and
Amyas put them off as best he could till one noon he saw slipping
along the shore from the westward a large ship under easy sail and
recognized in her or thought he did so the ship which they had passed
upon their way

If it was she she must have run past them to La Guayra in the night
and have now returned perhaps to search for them along the coast

She crept along slowly He was in hopes that she might pass the rivers
mouth but no She layto close to the shore and after a while Amyas
saw two boats pull in from her and vanish behind the mangroves

Sliding down a liane he told what he had seen The men tired of
inactivity received the news with a shout of joy and set to work to
make all ready for their guests Four brass swivels which they had
brought up were mounted fixed in logs so as to command the path the
musketeers and archers clustered round them with their tackle ready and
halfadozen good marksmen volunteered into the cottontree with their
arquebuses as a post whence a man might have very pretty shooting
Prayers followed as a matter of course and dinner as a matter of
course also but two weary hours passed before there was any sign of the
Spaniards

Presently a wreath of white smoke curled up from the swamp and then the
report of a caliver Then amid the growls of the English the Spanish
flag ran up above the trees and floatedhorrible to beholdat the
masthead of the Rose They were signalling the ship for more hands
and in effect a third boat soon pushed off and vanished into the
forest

Another hour during which the men had thoroughly lost their temper but
not their hearts by waiting and talked so loud and strode up and down
so wildly that Amyas had to warn them that there was no need to betray
themselves that the Spaniards might not find them after all that they
might pass the stockade close without seeing it that unless they hit
off the track at once they would probably return to their ship for the
present and exacted a promise from them that they would be perfectly
silent till he gave the word to fire

Which wise commands had scarcely passed his lips when in the path
below glanced the headpiece of a Spanish soldier and then another and
another

Fools whispered Amyas to Cary they are coming up in single file
rushing on their own death Lie close men

The path was so narrow that two could seldom come up abreast and so
steep that the enemy had much ado to struggle and stumble upwards The
men seemed half unwilling to proceed and hung back more than once
but Amyas could hear an authoritative voice behind and presently there
emerged to the front sword in hand a figure at which Amyas and Cary
both started

Is it he

Surely I know those legs among a thousand though they are in armor

It is my turn for him now Cary remember Silence silence men

The Spaniards seemed to feel that they were leading a forlorn hope Don
Guzman for there was little doubt that it was he had much ado to get
them on at all

The fellows have heard how gently we handled the Guayra squadron
whispers Cary and have no wish to become fellowmartyrs with the
captain of the Madre Dolorosa

At last the Spaniards get up the steep slope to within forty yards of
the stockade and pause suspecting a trap and puzzled by the complete
silence Amyas leaps on the top of it a white flag in his hand but his
heart beats so fiercely at the sight of that hated figure that he can
hardly get out the words

Don Guzman the quarrel is between you and me not between your men and
mine I would have sent in a challenge to you at La Guayra but you were
away I challenge you now to single combat

Lutheran dog I have a halter for you but no sword As you served us
at Smerwick we will serve you now Pirate and ravisher you and yours
shall share Oxenhams fate as you have copied his crimes and learn
what it is to set foot unbidden on the dominions of the king of Spain

The devil take you and the king of Spain together shouts Amyas
laughing loudly This ground belongs to him no more than it does to
me but to the Queen Elizabeth in whose name I have taken as lawful
possession of it as you ever did of Caracas Fire men and God defend
the right

Both parties obeyed the order Amyas dropped down behind the stockade
in time to let a caliver bullet whistle over his head and the Spaniards
recoiled as the narrow face of the stockade burst into one blaze of
musketry and swivels raking their long array from front to rear

The front ranks fell over each other in heaps the rear ones turned and
ran overtaken nevertheless by the English bullets and arrows which
tumbled them headlong down the steep path

Out men and charge them See the Don is running like the rest And
scrambling over the abattis Amyas and about thirty followed them fast
for he had hope of learning from some prisoner his brothers fate

Amyas was unjust in his last words Don Guzman as if by miracle had
been only slightly wounded and seeing his men run had rushed back and
tried to rally them but was borne away by the fugitives

However the Spaniards were out of sight among the thick bushes before
the English could overtake them and Amyas afraid lest they should
rally and surround his small party withdrew sorely against his will
and found in the pathway fourteen Spaniards but all dead For one of
the wounded with more courage than wisdom had fired on the English
as he lay and Amyass men whose blood was maddened both by their
desperate situation and the frightful stories of the rescued
galleyslaves had killed them all before their captain could stop them

Are you mad cries Amyas as he strikes up one fellows sword Will
you kill an Indian

And he drags out of the bushes an Indian lad of sixteen who slightly
wounded is crawling away like a copper snake along the ground

The black vermin has sent an arrow through my leg and poisoned too
most like

God grant not but an Indian is worth his weight in gold to us now
said Amyas tucking his prize under his arm like a bundle The lad as
soon as he saw there was no escape resigned himself to his fate with
true Indian stoicism was brought in and treated kindly enough but
refused to eat For which after much questioning he gave as a reason
that he would make them kill him at once for fat him they should not
and gradually gave them to understand that the English always so
at least the Spaniards said fatted and ate their prisoners like
the Caribs and till he saw them go out and bury the bodies of the
Spaniards nothing would persuade him that the corpses were not to be
cooked for supper

However kind words kind looks and the present of that inestimable
treasurea knife brought him to reason and he told Amyas that he
belonged to a Spaniard who had an encomienda of Indians some fifteen
miles to the southwest that he had fled from his master and lived
by hunting for some months past and having seen the ship where she lay
moored and boarded her in hope of plunder had been surprised therein
by the Spaniards and forced by threats to go with them as a guide in
their search for the English But now came a part of his story which
filled the soul of Amyas with delight He was an Indian of the Llanos
or great savannahs which lay to the southward beyond the mountains and
had actually been upon the Orinoco He had been stolen as a boy by some
Spaniards who had gone down as was the fashion of the Jesuits even
as late as 1790 for the pious purpose of converting the savages by the
simple process of catching baptizing and making servants of those
whom they could carry off and murdering those who resisted their gentle
method of salvation Did he know the way back again Who could ask such
a question of an Indian And the lads black eyes flashed fire as Amyas
offered him liberty and iron enough for a dozen Indians if he would
lead them through the passes of the mountains and southward to the
mighty river where lay their golden hopes Hernando de Serpa Amyas
knew had tried the same course which was supposed to be about one
hundred and twenty leagues and failed being overthrown utterly by the
Wikiri Indians but Amyas knew enough of the Spaniards brutal method
of treating those Indians to be pretty sure that they had brought that
catastrophe upon themselves and that he might avoid it well enough by
that common justice and mercy toward the savages which he had learned
from his incomparable tutor Francis Drake

Now was the time to speak and assembling his men around him Amyas
opened his whole heart simply and manfully This was their only hope
of safety Some of them had murmured that they should perish like John
Oxenhams crew This plan was rather the only way to avoid perishing
like them Don Guzman would certainly return to seek them and not only
he but landforces from St Jago Even if the stockade was not forced
they would be soon starved out why not move at once ere the Spaniards
could return and begin a blockade As for taking St Jago it was
impossible The treasure would all be safely hidden and the town well
prepared to meet them If they wanted gold and glory they must seek it
elsewhere Neither was there any use in marching along the coast and
trying the ports ships could outstrip them and the country was already
warned There was but this one chance and on it Amyas the first and
last time in his life waxed eloquent and set forth the glory of the
enterprise the service to the queen the salvation of heathens and
the certainty that if successful they should win honor and wealth and
everlasting fame beyond that of Cortez or Pizarro till the men sulky
at first warmed every moment and one old Pelican broke out with

Yes sir we didnt go round the world with you for naught and watched
your works and ways which was always those of a gentleman as you
arewho spoke a word for a poor fellow when he was in a scrape and saw
all you ought to see and naught that you ought not And well follow
you sir all alone to ourselves and let those that know you worse
follow after when theyre come to their right mind

Man after man capped this brave speech the minority who if they liked
little to go liked still less to be left behind gave in their consent
perforce and to make a long story short Amyas conquered and the plan
was accepted

This said Amyas is indeed the proudest day of my life I have lost
one brother but I have gained fourscore God do so to me and more also
if I do not deal with you according to the trust which you have put in
me this day

We I suppose are to believe that we have a right to laugh at Amyass
scheme as frantic and chimerical It is easy to amuse ourselves with the
premises after the conclusion has been found for us We know now that
he was mistaken but we have not discovered his mistake for ourselves
and have no right to plume ourselves on other mens discoveries Had we
lived in Amyass days we should have belonged either to the many wise
men who believed as he did or to the many foolish men who not only
sneered at the story of Manoa but at a hundred other stories which we
now know to be true Columbus was laughed at but he found a new world
nevertheless Cortez was laughed at but he found Mexico Pizarro but
he found Peru I ask any fair reader of those two charming books Mr
Prescotts Conquest of Mexico and his Conquest of Peru whether the true
wonders in them described do not outdo all the false wonders of Manoa

But what reason was there to think them false One quarter perhaps of
America had been explored and yet in that quarter two empires had been
already found in a state of mechanical military and agricultural
civilization superior in many things to any nation of Europe Was
it not most rational to suppose that in the remaining threequarters
similar empires existed If a second Mexico had been discovered in the
mountains of Parima and a second Peru in those of Brazil what right
would any man have had to wonder As for the gold legends nothing was
told of Manoa which had not been seen in Peru and Mexico by the bodily
eyes of men then living Why should not the rocks of Guiana have been
as full of the precious metals we do not know yet that they are not as
the rocks of Peru and Mexico were known to be Even the details of the
story its standing on a lake for instance bore a probability with
them Mexico actually stood in the centre of a lakewhy should not
Manoa The Peruvian worship centred round a sacred lakewhy not that
of Manoa Pizarro and Cortez again were led on to their desperate
enterprises by the sight of small quantities of gold among savages who
told them of a civilized goldcountry near at hand and they found that
those savages spoke truth Why was the unanimous report of the Carib
tribes of the Orinoco to be disbelieved when they told a similar tale
Sir Richard Schomburgks admirable preface to Raleighs Guiana proves
surely that the Indians themselves were deceived as well as deceivers
It was known again that vast quantities of the Peruvian treasure had
been concealed by the priests and that members of the Inca family had
fled across the Andes and held out against the Spaniards Barely fifty
years had elapsed since thenwhat more probable than that this remnant
of the Peruvian dynasty and treasure still existed Even the story of
the Amazons though it may serve Hume as a point for his ungenerous and
untruthful attempt to make Raleigh out either fool or villain has
come from Spaniards who had with their own eyes seen the Indian women
fighting by their husbands sides and from Indians who asserted the
existence of an Amazonian tribe What right had Amyas or any man to
disbelieve the story The existence of the Amazons in ancient Asia and
of their intercourse with Alexander the Great was then an accredited
part of history which it would have been gratuitous impertinence to
deny And what if some stories connected these warlike women with the
Emperor of Manoa and the capital itself This generation ought surely
to be the last to laugh at such a story at least as long as the
Amazonian guards of the King of Dahomey continue to outvie the men in
that relentless ferocity with which they have subdued every neighboring
tribe save the Christians of Abbeokuta In this case as in a hundred
more fact not only outdoes but justifies imagination and Amyas spoke
common sense when he said to his men that day

Let fools laugh and stay at home Wise men dare and win Saul went to
look for his fathers asses and found a kingdom and Columbus my men
was called a madman for only going to seek China and never knew they
say until his dying day that he had found a whole new world instead
of it Find Manoa God only who made all things knows what we may find
beside

So underneath that giant ceibatree those valiant men reduced by
battle and sickness to some eighty swore a great oath and kept that
oath like men To search for the golden city for two full years to come
whatever might befall to stand to each other for weal or woe to obey
their officers to the death to murmur privately against no man but
bring all complaints to a council of war to use no profane oaths but
serve God daily with prayer to take by violence from no man save from
their natural enemies the Spaniards to be civil and merciful to all
savages and chaste and courteous to all women to bring all booty and
all food into the common stock and observe to the utmost their faith
with the adventurers who had fitted out the ship and finally to march
at sunrise the next morning toward the south trusting in God to be
their guide

It is a great oath and a hard one said Brimblecombe but God will
give us strength to keep it And they knelt all together and received
the Holy Communion and then rose to pack provisions and ammunition
and lay down again to sleep and to dream that they were sailing home
up Torridge streamas Cavendish returning from round the world did
actually sail home up Thames but five years afterwardswith mariners
and soldiers clothed in silk with sails of damask and topsails of
cloth of gold and the richest prize which ever was brought at one time
unto English shores

     

The Cross stands upright in the southern sky It is the middle of the
night Cary and Yeo glide silently up the hill and into the camp
and whisper to Amyas that they have done the deed The sleepers are
awakened and the train sets forth

Upward and southward ever but whither who can tell They hardly think
of the whither but go like sleepwalkers shaken out of one land of
dreams only to find themselves in another and stranger one All around
is fantastic and unearthly now each man starts as he sees the figures
of his fellows clothed from head to foot in golden filigree looks up
and sees the yellow moonlight through the fronds of the huge treeferns
overhead as through a cloud of glittering lace Now they are hewing
their way through a thicket of enormous flags now through bamboos forty
feet high now they are stumbling over boulders waistdeep in cushions
of clubmoss now they are struggling through shrubberies of heaths and
rhododendrons and woolly incensetrees where every leaf as they brush
past dashes some fresh scent into their faces and

 The winds with musky wing
 About the cedarn alleys fling
 Nard and cassias balmy smells

Now they open upon some craggy brow from whence they can see far below
an ocean of soft cloud whose silver billows girdled by the mountain
sides hide the lowland from their sight

And from beneath the cloud strange voices rise the screams of thousand
nightbirds and wild howls which they used at first to fancy were the
cries of ravenous beasts till they found them to proceed from nothing
fiercer than an ape But what is that deeper note like a series
of muffled explosionsarquebuses fired within some subterranean
cavernthe heavy pulse of which rolls up through the depths of the
unseen forest They hear it now for the first time but they will hear
it many a time again and the Indian lad is hushed and cowers close
to them and then takes heart as he looks upon their swords and
arquebuses for that is the roar of the jaguar seeking his meat from
God

But what is that glare away to the northward The yellow moon is ringed
with gay rainbows but that light is far too red to be the reflection
of any beams of hers Now through the cloud rises a column of black and
lurid smoke the fog clears away right and left around it and shows
beneath a mighty fire

The men look at each other with questioning eyes each half suspecting
and yet not daring to confess their own suspicions and Amyas whispers
to Yeo

You took care to flood the powder

Ay ay sir and to unload the ordnance too No use in making a noise
to tell the Spaniards our whereabouts

Yes that glare rises from the good ship Rose Amyas like Cortez of
old has burnt his ship and retreat is now impossible Forward into the
unknown abyss of the New World and God be with them as they go

The Indian knows a cunning path it winds along the highest ridges of
the mountains but the travelling is far more open and easy

They have passed the head of a valley which leads down to St Jago
Beneath that long shining river of mist which ends at the foot of
the great Silla lies so says the Indian lad the rich capital of
Venezuela and beyond the goldmines of Los Teques and Baruta which
first attracted the founder Diego de Losada and many a longing eye is
turned towards it as they pass the saddle at the valley head but the
attempt is hopeless they turn again to the left and so down towards
the rancho taking care so the prudent Amyas had commanded to break
down after crossing the frail rope bridge which spans each torrent and
ravine

They are at the rancho long before daybreak and have secured there
not only fourteen mules but eight or nine Indians stolen from off
the Llanos like their guide who are glad enough to escape from their
tyrants by taking service with them And now southward and away with
lightened shoulders and hearts for they are all but safe from pursuit
The broken bridges prevent the news of their raid reaching St Jago
until nightfall and in the meanwhile Don Guzman returns to the river
mouth the next day to find the ship a blackened wreck and the camp
empty follows their trail over the hills till he is stopped by a broken
bridge surmounts that difficulty and meets a second his men are
worn out with heat and a little afraid of stumbling on the heretic
desperadoes and he returns by land to St Jago and when he arrives
there has news from home which gives him other things to think of than
following those mad Englishmen who have vanished into the wilderness
What need after all to follow them asked the Spaniards of each
other Blinded by the devil whom they serve they rush on in search of
certain death as many a larger company has before them and they will
find it and will trouble La Guayra no more forever Lutheran dogs and
enemies of God said Don Guzman to his soldiers they will leave their
bones to whiten on the Llanos as may every heretic who sets foot on
Spanish soil

Will they do so Don Guzman Or wilt thou and Amyas meet again upon a
mightier battlefield to learn a lesson which neither of you yet has
learned



CHAPTER XXII

THE INQUISITION IN THE INDIES


My next chapter is perhaps too sad it shall be at least as short as I
can make it but it was needful to be written that readers may judge
fairly for themselves what sort of enemies the English nation had to
face in those stern days

Three weeks have passed and the scene is shifted to a long low range
of cells in a dark corridor in the city of Cartagena The door of one is
open and within stand two cloaked figures one of whom we know It is
Eustace Leigh The other is a familiar of the Holy Office

He holds in his hand a lamp from which the light falls on a bed of
straw and on the sleeping figure of a man The high white brow the
pale and delicate featuresthem too we know for they are those of
Frank Saved halfdead from the fury of the savage negroes he has been
reserved for the more delicate cruelty of civilized and Christian men
He underwent the question but this afternoon and now Eustace his
betrayer is come to persuade himor to entrap him Eustace himself
hardly knows whether of the two

And yet he would give his life to save his cousin

His life He has long since ceased to care for that He has done what
he has done because it is his duty and now he is to do his duty
once more and wake the sleeper and argue coax threaten him into
recantation while his heart is still tender from the torture so
Eustaces employers phrase it

And yet how calmly he is sleeping Is it but a freak of the lamplight
or is there a smile upon his lips Eustace takes the lamp and bends over
him to see and as he bends he hears Frank whispering in his dreams his
mothers name and a name higher and holier still

Eustace cannot find the heart to wake him

Let him rest whispers he to his companion After all I fear my
words will be of little use

I fear so too sir Never did I behold a more obdurate heretic He did
not scruple to scoff openly at their holinesses

Ah said Eustace great is the pravity of the human heart and the
power of Satan Let us go for the present

Where is she

The elder sorceress or the younger

The youngerthe

The Senora de Soto Ah poor thing One could be sorry for her were
she not a heretic And the man eyed Eustace keenly and then quietly
added She is at present with the notary to the benefit of her soul I
trust

Eustace half stopped shuddering He could hardly collect himself enough
to gasp out an Amen

Within there said the man pointing carelessly to a door as they
went down the corridor We can listen a moment if you like but dont
betray me senor

Eustace knows well enough that the fellow is probably on the watch to
betray him if he shows any signs of compunction at least to report
faithfully to his superiors the slightest expression of sympathy with
a heretic but a horrible curiosity prevails over fear and he pauses
close to the fatal door His face is all of a flame his knees knock
together his ears are ringing his heart bursting through his ribs as
he supports himself against the wall hiding his convulsed face as well
as he can from his companion

A mans voice is plainly audible within low but distinct The notary
is trying that old charge of witchcraft which the Inquisitors whether
to justify themselves to their own consciences or to whiten their
villainy somewhat in the eyes of the mob so often brought against their
victims And then Eustaces heart sinks within him as he hears a womans
voice reply sharpened by indignation and agony

Witchcraft against Don Guzman What need of that oh God what need

You deny it then senora we are sorry for you but

A confused choking murmur from the victim mingled with words which
might mean anything or nothing

She has confessed whispered Eustace saints I thank youshe

A wail which rings through Eustaces ears and brain and heart He
would have torn at the door to open it but his companion forces him
away Another and another wail while the wretched man hurries off
stopping his ears in vain against those piercing cries which follow
him like avenging angels through the dreadful vaults

He escaped into the fragrant open air and the golden tropic moonlight
and a garden which might have served as a model for Eden but mans hell
followed into Gods heaven and still those wails seemed to ring through
his ears

Oh misery misery misery murmured he to himself through grinding
teeth and I have brought her to this I have had to bring her to it
What else could I Who dare blame me And yet what devilish sin can I
have committed that requires to be punished thus Was there no one to
be found but me No one And yet it may save her soul It may bring her
to repentance

It may indeed for she is delicate and cannot endure much You
ought to know as well as I senor the merciful disposition of the Holy
Office

I know it I know it interrupted poor Eustace trembling now for
himself All in loveall in loveA paternal chastisement

And the proofs of heresy are patent beside the strong suspicion
of enchantment and the known character of the elder sorceress
You yourself you must remember senor told us that she had been a
notorious witch in England before the senora brought her hither as her
attendant

Of course she was of course Yes there was no other course open And
though the flesh may be weak sir in my case yet none can have proved
better to the Holy Office how willing is the spirit

And so Eustace departed and ere another sun had set he had gone to the
principal of the Jesuits told him his whole heart or as much of it
poor wretch as he dare tell to himself and entreated to be allowed to
finish his novitiate and enter the order on the understanding that he
was to be sent at once back to Europe or anywhere else Otherwise
as he said frankly he should go mad even if he were not mad already
The Jesuit who was a kindly man enough went to the Holy Office and
settled all with the Inquisitors recounting to them to set him above
all suspicion Eustaces past valiant services to the Church His
testimony was no longer needed he left Cartagena for Nombre that very
night and sailed the next week I know not whither

I say I know not whither Eustace Leigh vanishes henceforth from these
pages He may have ended as General of his Order He may have worn out
his years in some tropic forest conquering the souls including of
course the bodies of Indians he may have gone back to his old work
in England and been the very Ballard who was hanged and quartered three
years afterwards for his share in Babingtons villainous conspiracy
I know not This book is a history of menof mens virtues and sins
victories and defeats and Eustace is a man no longer he is become a
thing a tool a Jesuit which goes only where it is sent and does good
or evil indifferently as it is bid which by an act of moral suicide
has lost its soul in the hope of saving it without a will a
conscience a responsibility as it fancies to God or man but only to
The Society In a word Eustace as he says himself is dead Twice
dead I fear Let the dead bury their dead We have no more concern with
Eustace Leigh



CHAPTER XXIII

THE BANKS OF THE META

 My mariners
 Souls that have toild and wrought and thought with
 meDeath closes all but something ere the end
 Some work of noble note may yet be done
 Not unbecoming men that strove with gods

 TENNYSONS Ulysses

Nearly three years are past and gone since that little band had knelt
at evensong beneath the giant tree of Guayrayears of seeming blank
through which they are to be tracked only by scattered notes and
misspelt names Through untrodden hills and forests over a space of
some eight hundred miles in length by four hundred in breadth they had
been seeking for the Golden City and they had sought in vain They had
sought it along the wooded banks of the Orinoco and beyond the roaring
foamworld of Maypures and on the upper waters of the mighty Amazon
They had gone up the streams even into Peru itself and had trodden the
cinchona groves of Loxa ignorant as all the world was then of their
healing virtues They had seen the virgin snows of Chimborazo towering
white above the thundercloud and the giant cone of Cotopaxi blackening
in its sullen wrath before the fiery streams rolled down its sides
Foiled in their search at the back of the Andes they had turned
eastward once more and plunged from the alpine cliffs into the green
and misty ocean of the Montana Slowly and painfully they had worked
their way northward again along the eastern foot of the inland
Cordillera and now they were bivouacking as it seems upon one of the
many feeders of the Meta which flow down from the Suma Paz into the
forestcovered plains There they sat their watchfires glittering
on the stream beneath the shadow of enormous trees Amyas and Cary
Brimblecombe Yeo and the Indian lad who has followed them in all
their wanderings alive and well but as far as ever from Manoa and
its fairy lake and golden palaces and all the wonders of the Indians
tale Again and again in their wanderings they had heard faint rumors of
its existence and started off in some fresh direction to meet only a
fresh disappointment and hope deferred which maketh sick the heart

There they sit at lastfourandforty men out of the eightyfour who
left the tree of Guayrawhere are the rest

 Their bones are scatterd far and wide
 By mount by stream and sea

Drew the master lies on the banks of the Rio Negro and five brave
fellows by him slain in fight by the poisoned arrows of the Indians in
a vain attempt to penetrate the mountaingorges of the Parima Two more
lie amid the valleys of the Andes frozen to death by the fierce slaty
hail which sweeps down from the condors eyrie four more were drowned
at one of the rapids of the Orinoco five or six more wounded men are
left behind at another rapid among friendly Indians to be recovered
when they can be perhaps never Fever snakes jaguars alligators
cannibal fish electric eels have thinned their ranks month by month
and of their march through the primeval wilderness no track remains
except those lonely graves

And there the survivors sit beside the silent stream beneath the
tropic moon sundried and lean but strong and bold as ever with the
quiet fire of English courage burning undimmed in every eye and the
genial smile of English mirth fresh on every lip making a jest of
danger and a sport of toil as cheerily as when they sailed over the bar
of Bideford in days which seem to belong to some antenatal life Their
beards have grown down upon their breasts their long hair is knotted
on their heads like womens to keep off the burning sunshine their
leggings are of the skin of the delicate Guazuputi deer their shirts
are patched with Indian cotton web the spoils of jaguar puma and ape
hang from their shoulders Their ammunition is long since spent their
muskets spoilt by the perpetual vaporbath of the steaming woods are
left behind as useless in a cave by some cataract of the Orinoco but
their swords are bright and terrible as ever and they carry bows of
a strength which no Indian arm can bend and arrows pointed with the
remnants of their armor many of them too are armed with the pocuna
or blowgun of the Indiansmore deadly because more silent than the
firearms which they have left behind them So they have wandered and so
they will wander still the lords of the forest and its beasts terrible
to all hostile Indians but kindly just and generous to all who will
deal faithfully with them and many a smoothchinned Carib and
Ature Solimo and Guahiba recounts with wonder and admiration the
righteousness of the bearded heroes who proclaimed themselves the
deadly foes of the faithless and murderous Spaniard and spoke to them
of the great and good queen beyond the seas who would send her warriors
to deliver and avenge the oppressed Indian

The men are sleeping among the trees some on the ground and some in
grasshammocks slung between the stems All is silent save the heavy
plunge of the tapir in the river as he tears up the waterweeds for
his nights repast Sometimes indeed the jaguar as he climbs from one
treetop to another after his prey wakens the monkeys clustered on the
boughs and they again arouse the birds and ten minutes of unearthly
roars howls shrieks and cacklings make the forest ring as if all
pandemonium had broke loose but that soon dies away again and even
while it lasts it is too common a matter to awaken the sleepers
much less to interrupt the council of war which is going on beside
the watchfire between the three adventurers and the faithful Yeo A
hundred times have they held such a council and in vain and for aught
they know this one will be as fruitless as those which have gone before
it Nevertheless it is a more solemn one than usual for the two years
during which they had agreed to search for Manoa are long past and some
new place must be determined on unless they intend to spend the rest of
their lives in that green wilderness

Well says Will Cary taking his cigar out of his mouth at least we
have got something out of those last Indians It is a comfort to have a
puff at tobacco once more after three weeks fasting

For me said Jack Brimblecombe Heaven forgive me but when I get the
magical leaf between my teeth again I feel tempted to sit as still as a
chimney and smoke till my dying day without stirring hand or foot

Then I shall forbid you tobacco Master Parson said Amyas for we
must be up and away again tomorrow We have been idling here three
mortal days and nothing done

Shall we ever do anything I think the gold of Manoa is like the gold
which lies where the rainbow touches the ground always a field beyond
you

Amyas was silent awhile and so were the rest There was no denying that
their hopes were all but gone In the immense circuit which they had
made they had met with nothing but disappointment

There is but one more chance said he at length and that is the
mountains to the east of the Orinoco where we failed the first time
The Incas may have moved on to them when they escaped

Why not said Cary they would so put all the forests beside the
Llanos and halfadozen great rivers between them and those dogs of
Spaniards

Shall we try it once more said Amyas This river ought to run
into the Orinoco and once there we are again at the very foot of the
mountains What say you Yeo

I cannot but mind your worship that when we came up the Orinoco
the Indians told us terrible stories of those mountains how far they
stretched and how difficult they were to cross by reason of the cliffs
aloft and the thick forests in the valleys And have we not lost five
good men there already

What care we No forests can be thicker than those we have bored
through already why if one had had but a tail like a monkey for
an extra warp one might have gone a hundred miles on end along the
treetops and found it far pleasanter walking than tripping in withes
and being eaten up with creeping things from morn till night

But remember too said Jack how they told us to beware of the
Amazons

What Jack afraid of a parcel of women

Why not said Jack I wouldnt run from a man as you know but a
womanits not natural like They must be witches or devils See how
the Caribs feared them And there were men there without necks and with
their eyes in their breasts they said Now how could a Christian tackle
such customers as them

He couldnt cut off their heads thats certain but I suppose a poke
in the ribs will do as much for them as for their neighbors

Well said Jack if I fight let me fight honest flesh and blood
thats all and none of these outlandish monsters How do you know but
that they are invulnerable by artmagic

How do you know that they are And as for the Amazons said Cary
womans woman all the world over Ill bet that you may wheedle them
round with a compliment or two just as if they were so many burghers
wives Pity I have not a courtsuit and a Spanish hat I would have
taken an orange in one hand and a handkerchief in the other gone all
alone to them as ambassador and been in a week as great with Queen
Blackfacealinda as ever Raleigh is at Whitehall

Gentlemen said Yeo where you go I go and not only I but every
man of us I doubt not but we have lost now half our company and spent
our ammunition so we are no better men were it not for our swords
than these naked heathens round us Now it was as you all know by the
wonder and noise of their ordnance let alone their horses which is a
breakneck beast I put no faith in that both Cortez and Pizarro those
imps of Satan made their golden conquests with which if we could have
astounded the people of Manoa

Having first found the said people laughed Amyas It is like the
old fable Every craftsman thinks his own trade the one pillar of the
commonweal

Well your worship quoth Yeo it may be that being a gunner I
overprize guns But it dont need slate and pencil to do this sumAre
forty men without shot as good as eighty with

Thou art right old fellow right enough and I was only jesting for
very sorrow and must needs laugh about it lest I weep about it Our
chance is over I believe though I dare not confess as much to the
men

Sir said Yeo I have a feeling on me that the Lords hand is against
us in this matter Whether He means to keep this wealth for worthier men
than us or whether it is His will to hide this great city in the secret
place of His presence from the strife of tongues and so to spare them
from sinful mans covetousness and England from that sin and luxury
which I have seen gold beget among the Spaniards I know not sir for
who knoweth the counsels of the Lord But I have long had a voice within
which saith Salvation Yeo thou shalt never behold the Golden City
which is on earth where heathens worship sun and moon and the hosts of
heaven be content therefore to see that Golden City which is above
where is neither sun nor moon but the Lord God and the Lamb are the
light thereof

There was a simple majesty about old Yeo when he broke forth in
utterances like these which made his comrades and even Amyas and Cary
look on him as Mussulmans look on madmen as possessed of mysterious
knowledge and flashes of inspiration and Brimblecombe whose pious soul
looked up to the old hero with a reverence which had overcome all his
Churchmans prejudices against Anabaptists answered gently

Amen amen my masters all and it has been on my mind too this long
time that there is a providence against our going east for see how
this two years past whenever we have pushed eastward we have fallen
into trouble and lost good men and whenever we went Westwardho we
have prospered and do prosper to this day

And what is more gentlemen said Yeo if as Scripture says dreams
are from the Lord I verily believe mine last night came from Him for
as I lay by the fire sirs I heard my little maids voice calling of
me as plain as ever I heard in my life and the very same words sirs
which she learned from me and my good comrade William Penberthy to say
Westwardho jolly mariners all a bit of an ungodly song my masters
which we sang in our wild days but she stood and called it as plain as
ever mortal ears heard and called again till I answered Coming my
maid coming and after that the dear chuck called no moreGod grant I
find her yetand so I woke

Cary had long since given up laughing at Yeo about the little maid
and Amyas answered

So let it be Yeo if the rest agree but what shall we do to the
westward

Do said Cary theres plenty to do for theres plenty of gold
and plenty of Spaniards too they say on the other side of these
mountains so that our swords will not rust for lack of adventures my
gay knightserrant all

So they chatted on and before night was half through a plan was
matured desperate enoughbut what cared those brave hearts for that
They would cross the Cordillera to Santa Fe de Bogota of the wealth
whereof both Yeo and Amyas had often heard in the Pacific try to seize
either the town or some convoy of gold going from it make for the
nearest river there was said to be a large one which ran northward
thence build canoes and try to reach the Northern Sea once more and
then if Heaven prospered them they might seize a Spanish ship and
make their way home to England not indeed with the wealth of Manoa
but with a fair booty of Spanish gold This was their new dream It was
a wild one but hardly more wild than the one which Drake had fulfilled
and not as wild as the one which Oxenham might have fulfilled but for
his own fatal folly

Amyas sat watching late that night sad of heart To give up the
cherished dream of years was hard to face his mother harder still but
it must be done for the mens sake So the new plan was proposed next
day and accepted joyfully They would go up to the mountains and rest
awhile if possible bring up the wounded whom they had left behind and
then try a new venture with new hopes perhaps new dangers they were
inured to the latter

They started next morning cheerfully enough and for three hours or more
paddled easily up the glassy and windless reaches between two green
flowerbespangled walls of forest gay with innumerable birds and
insects while down from the branches which overhung the stream long
trailers hung to the waters edge and seemed admiring in the clear
mirror the images of their own gorgeous flowers River trees flowers
birds insectsit was all a fairyland but it was a colossal one and
yet the voyagers took little note of it It was now to them an everyday
occurrence to see trees full two hundred feet high one mass of yellow
or purple blossom to the highest twigs and every branch and stem one
hanging garden of crimson and orange orchids or vanillas Common to them
were all the fantastic and enormous shapes with which Nature bedecks her
robes beneath the fierce suns and fattening rains of the tropic forest
Common were forms and colors of bird and fish and butterfly more
strange and bright than ever opiumeater dreamed The long processions
of monkeys who kept pace with them along the treetops and proclaimed
their wonder in every imaginable whistle and grunt and howl had
ceased to move their laughter as much as the roar of the jaguar and the
rustle of the boa had ceased to move their fear and when a brilliant
green and rosecolored fish flatbodied like a bream flabfinned like
a salmon and sawtoothed like a shark leapt clean on board of the
canoe to escape the rush of the huge alligator whose loathsome snout
ere he could stop actually rattled against the canoe within a foot of
Jack Brimblecombes hand Jack instead of turning pale as he had done
at the sharks upon a certain memorable occasion coolly picked up the
fish and said Hes four pound weight If you can catch pirai for
us like that old fellow just keep in our wake and well give you the
cleanings for wages

Yes The mind of man is not so infinite in the vulgar sense of that
word as people fancy and however greedy the appetite for wonder may
be while it remains unsatisfied in everyday European life it is as
easily satiated as any other appetite and then leaves the senses of
its possessor as dull as those of a city gourmand after a lord mayors
feast Only the highest mindsour Humboldts and Bonplands and
Schomburgks and they only when quickened to an almost unhealthy
activity by civilizationcan go on long appreciating where Nature is
insatiable imperious maddening in her demands on our admiration The
very power of observing wears out under the rush of ever new objects
and the dizzy spectator is fain at last to shut the eyes of his soul
and take refuge as West Indian Spaniards do in tobacco and stupidity
The man too who has not only eyes but utterancewhat shall he do
where all words fail him Superlatives are but inarticulate after all
and give no pictures even of size any more than do numbers of feet and
yards and yet what else can we do but heap superlative on superlative
and cry Wonderful wonderful and after that wonderful past all
whooping What Humboldts self cannot paint we will not try to daub
The voyagers were in a South American forest readers Fill up the
meaning of those words each as your knowledge enables you for I cannot
do it for you

Certainly those adventurers could not The absence of any attempt at
wordpainting even of admiration at the glorious things which they saw
is most remarkable in all early voyagers both Spanish and English The
only two exceptions which I recollect are Columbusbut then all was
new and he was bound to tell what he had seenand Raleigh the two
most gifted men perhaps with the exception of Humboldt who ever set
foot in tropical America but even they dare nothing but a few feeble
hints in passing Their souls had been dazzled and stunned by a great
glory Coming out of our European Nature into that tropic one they had
felt like Platos men bred in the twilight cavern and then suddenly
turned round to the broad blaze of day they had seen things awful and
unspeakable why talk of them except to say with the Turks God is
great

So it was with these men Among the higherhearted of them the grandeur
and the glory around had attuned their spirits to itself and kept up in
them a lofty heroical reverent frame of mind but they knew as little
about the trees and animals in an artistic or critical point
of view as in a scientific one This tree the Indians called one
unpronounceable name and it made good bows that some other name and
it made good canoes of that you could eat the fruit that produced the
caoutchouc gum useful for a hundred matters that was what the Indians
and they likewise used to poison their arrows with from the ashes of
those palmnuts you could make good salt that tree again was full of
good milk if you bored the stem they drank it and gave God thanks and
were not astonished God was great but that they had discovered long
before they came into the tropics Noble old childhearted heroes with
just romance and superstition enough about them to keep them from that
prurient hysterical wonder and enthusiasm which is simply one often
fears a product of our scepticism We do not trust enough in God we do
not really believe His power enough to be ready as they were as every
one ought to be on a Godmade earth for anything and everything being
possible and then when a wonder is discovered we go into ecstasies
and shrieks over it and take to ourselves credit for being susceptible
of so lofty a feeling true index forsooth of a refined and cultivated
mind

They paddled onward hour after hour sheltering themselves as best they
could under the shadow of the southern bank while on their right hand
the full sunglare lay upon the enormous wall of mimosas figs and
laurels which formed the northern forest broken by the slender shafts
of bamboo tufts and decked with a thousand gaudy parasites bank upon
bank of gorgeous bloom piled upward to the sky till where its outline
cut the blue flowers and leaves too lofty to be distinguished by the
eye formed a broken rainbow of all hues quivering in the ascending
streams of azure mist until they seemed to melt and mingle with the
very heavens

And as the sun rose higher and higher a great stillness fell upon the
forest The jaguars and the monkeys had hidden themselves in the darkest
depths of the woods The birds notes died out one by one the very
butterflies ceased their flitting over the treetops and slept with
outspread wings upon the glossy leaves undistinguishable from the
flowers around them Now and then a colibri whirred downward toward
the water hummed for a moment around some pendent flower and then
the living gem was lost in the deep blackness of the inner wood among
treetrunks as huge and dark as the pillars of some Hindoo shrine or
a parrot swung and screamed at them from an overhanging bough or a
thirsty monkey slid lazily down a liana to the surface of the stream
dipped up the water in his tiny hand and started chattering back as
his eyes met those of some foul alligator peering upward through the
clear depths below In shaded nooks beneath the boughs the capybaras
rabbits as large as sheep went paddling sleepily round and round
thrusting up their unwieldy heads among the blooms of the blue
waterlilies while black and purple waterhens ran up and down upon the
rafts of floating leaves The shining snout of a freshwater dolphin rose
slowly to the surface a jet of spray whirred up a rainbow hung upon
it for a moment and the black snout sank lazily again Here and there
too upon some shallow pebbly shore scarlet flamingoes stood dreaming
kneedeep on one leg crested cranes pranced up and down admiring
their own finery and ibises and egrets dipped their bills under water
in search of prey but before noon even those had slipped away and
there reigned a stillness which might be heardsuch a stillness to
compare small things with great as broods beneath the rich shadows of
Amyass own Devon woods or among the lonely sweeps of Exmoor when the
heather is in flowera stillness in which as Humboldt says If beyond
the silence we listen for the faintest undertones we detect a stifled
continuous hum of insects which crowd the air close to the earth a
confused swarming murmur which hangs round every bush in the cracked
bark of trees in the soil undermined by lizards millepedes and
bees a voice proclaiming to us that all Nature breathes that under a
thousand different forms life swarms in the gaping and dusty earth as
much as in the bosom of the waters and the air which breathes around

At last a soft and distant murmur increasing gradually to a heavy roar
announced that they were nearing some cataract till turning a point
where the deep alluvial soil rose into a low cliff fringed with delicate
ferns they came full in sight of a scene at which all paused not with
astonishment but with something very like disgust

Rapids again grumbled one I thought we had had enough of them on
the Orinoco

We shall have to get out and draw the canoes overland I suppose
Three hours will be lost and in the very hottest of the day too

Theres worse behind dont you see the spray behind the palms

Stop grumbling my masters and dont cry out before you are hurt
Paddle right up to the largest of those islands and let us look about
us

In front of them was a snowwhite bar of raging foam some ten feet
high along which were ranged three or four islands of black rock Each
was crested with a knot of lofty palms whose green tops stood out clear
against the bright sky while the lower half of their stems loomed hazy
through a luminous veil of rainbowed mist The banks right and left
of the fall were so densely fringed with a low hedge of shrubs that
landing seemed all but impossible and their Indian guide suddenly
looking round him and whispering bade them beware of savages and
pointed to a canoe which lay swinging in the eddies under the largest
island moored apparently to the root of some tree

Silence all cried Amyas and paddle up thither and seize the canoe
If there be an Indian on the island we will have speech of him but
mind and treat him friendly and on your lives neither strike nor
shoot even if he offers to fight

So choosing a line of smooth backwater just in the wake of the island
they drove their canoes up by main force and fastened them safely
by the side of the Indians while Amyas always the foremost sprang
boldly on shore whispering to the Indian boy to follow him

Once on the island Amyas felt sure enough that if its wild tenant had
not seen them approach he certainly had not heard them so deafening
was the noise which filled his brain and seemed to make the very leaves
upon the bushes quiver and the solid stone beneath his feet to reel and
ring For two hundred yards and more above the fall nothing met his eye
but one white waste of raging foam with here and there a transverse
dyke of rock which hurled columns of spray and surges of beaded water
high into the airstrangely contrasting with the still and silent
cliffs of green leaves which walled the river right and left and more
strangely still with the knots of enormous palms upon the islets which
reared their polished shafts a hundred feet into the air straight and
upright as masts while their broad plumes and goldenclustered fruit
slept in the sunshine far aloft the image of the stateliest repose amid
the wildest wrath of Nature

He looked round anxiously for the expected Indian but he was nowhere to
be seen and in the meanwhile as he stept cautiously along the island
which was some fifty yards in length and breadth his senses accustomed
as they were to such sights could not help dwelling on the exquisite
beauty of the scene on the garden of gay flowers of every imaginable
form and hue which fringed every boulder at his feet peeping out amid
delicate fernfans and luxuriant cushions of moss on the chequered
shade of the palms and the cool air which wafted down from the
cataracts above the scents of a thousand flowers Gradually his ear
became accustomed to the roar and above its mighty undertone he could
hear the whisper of the wind among the shrubs and the hum of myriad
insects while the rock manakin with its saffron plumage flitted
before him from stone to stone calling cheerily and seeming to lead
him on Suddenly scrambling over the rocky flowerbeds to the other
side of the isle he came upon a little shady beach which beneath a
bank of stone some six feet high fringed the edge of a perfectly still
and glassy bay Ten yards farther the cataract fell sheer in thunder
but a high fernfringed rock turned its force away from that quiet nook
In it the water swung slowly round and round in glassy darkgreen rings
among which dimpled a hundred gaudy fish waiting for every fly and worm
which spun and quivered on the eddy Here if anywhere was the place to
find the owner of the canoe He leapt down upon the pebbles and as he
did so a figure rose from behind a neighboring rock and met him face
to face

It was an Indian girl and yet when he looked againwas it an Indian
girl Amyas had seen hundreds of those delicate darkskinned daughters
of the forest but never such a one as this Her stature was taller
her limbs were fuller and more rounded her complexion though tanned by
light was fairer by far than his own sunburnt face her hair crowned
with a garland of white flowers was not lank and straight and black
like an Indians but of a rich glossy brown and curling richly and
crisply from her very temples to her knees Her forehead though low
was upright and ample her nose was straight and small her lips the
lips of a European her whole face of the highest and richest type of
Spanish beauty a collar of gold mingled with green beads hung round her
neck and golden bracelets were on her wrists All the strange and dim
legends of white Indians and of nations of a higher race than Carib or
Arrowak or Solimo which Amyas had ever heard rose up in his memory
She must be the daughter of some great cacique perhaps of the lost
Incas themselveswhy not And full of simple wonder he gazed upon
that fairy vision while she unabashed in her free innocence gazed
fearlessly in return as Eve might have done in Paradise upon the
mighty stature and the strange garments and above all on the bushy
beard and flowing yellow locks of the Englishman

He spoke first in some Indian tongue gently and smilingly and made
a halfstep forward but quick as light she caught up from the ground a
bow and held it fiercely toward him fitted with the long arrow
with which as he could see she had been striking fish for a line of
twisted grass hung from its barbed head Amyas stopped laid down his
own bow and sword and made another step in advance smiling still
and making all Indian signs of amity but the arrow was still pointed
straight at his breast and he knew the mettle and strength of the
forest nymphs well enough to stand still and call for the Indian boy
too proud to retreat but in the uncomfortable expectation of feeling
every moment the shaft quivering between his ribs

The boy who had been peering from above leaped down to them in a
moment and began as the safest method grovelling on his nose upon the
pebbles while he tried two or three dialects one of which at last she
seemed to understand and answered in a tone of evident suspicion and
anger

What does she say

That you are a Spaniard and a robber because you have a beard

Tell her that we are no Spaniards but that we hate them and are come
across the great waters to help the Indians to kill them

The boy translated his speech The nymph answered by a contemptuous
shake of the head

Tell her that if she will send her tribe to us we will do them no
harm We are going over the mountains to fight the Spaniards and we
want them to show us the way

The boy had no sooner spoken than nimble as a deer the nymph had
sprung up the rocks and darted between the palmstems to her canoe
Suddenly she caught sight of the English boat and stopped with a cry of
fear and rage

Let her pass shouted Amyas who had followed her close Push your
boat off and let her pass Boy tell her to go on they will not come
near her

But she hesitated still and with arrow drawn to the head faced first
on the boats crew and then on Amyas till the Englishmen had shoved
off full twenty yards

Then leaping into her tiny piragua she darted into the wildest whirl
of the eddies shooting along with vigorous strokes while the English
trembled as they saw the frail bark spinning and leaping amid the
muzzles of the alligators and the huge dogtoothed trout but with the
swiftness of an arrow she reached the northern bank drove her canoe
among the bushes and leaping from it darted through some narrow
opening in the bush and vanished like a dream

What fair virago have you unearthed cried Cary as they toiled up
again to the landingplace

Beshrew me quoth Jack but we are in the very land of the nymphs
and I shall expect to see Diana herself next with the moon on her
forehead

Take care then where you wander hereabouts Sir John lest you end as
Actaeon did by turning into a stag and being eaten by a jaguar

Actaeon was eaten by his own hounds Mr Cary so the parallel dont
hold But surely she was a very wonder of beauty

Why was it that Amyas did not like this harmless talk There had come
over him the strangest new feeling as if that fair vision was his
property and the men had no right to talk about her no right to have
even seen her And he spoke quite surlily as he said

You may leave the women to themselves my masters youll have to deal
with the men ere long so get your canoes up on the rock and keep good
watch

Hillo shouted one in a few minutes heres fresh fish enough to feed
us all round I suppose that young catamountain left it behind her
in her hurry I wish she had left her golden chains and ouches into the
bargain

Well said another well take it as fair payment for having made
us drop down the current again to let her ladyship pass

Leave that fish alone said Amyas it is none of yours

Why sir quoth the finder in a tone of sulky deprecation

If we are to make good friends with the heathens we had better not
begin by stealing their goods There are plenty more fish in the river
go and catch them and let the Indians have their own

The men were accustomed enough to strict and stern justice in their
dealings with the savages but they could not help looking slyly at
each other and hinting when out of sight that the captain seemed in a
mighty fuss about his new acquaintance

However they were expert by this time in all the Indians fishing
methods and so abundant was the animal life which swarmed around every
rock that in an hour fish enough lay on the beach to feed them all
whose forms and colors names and families I must leave the reader to
guess from the wondrous pages of Sir Richard Schomburgk for I know too
little of them to speak without the fear of making mistakes

A full hour passed before they saw anything more of their Indian
neighbors and then from under the bushes shot out a canoe on which all
eyes were fixed in expectation

Amyas who expected to find there some remnant of a higher race was
disappointed enough at seeing on board only the usual halfdozen of
lowbrowed dirty Orsons painted red with arnotto but a grayheaded
elder at the stern seemed by his feathers and gold ornaments to be
some man of note in the little woodland community

The canoe came close up to the island Amyas saw that they were unarmed
and laying down his weapons advanced alone to the bank making all
signs of amity They were returned with interest by the old man and
Amyass next care was to bring forward the fish which the fair nymph
had left behind and through the medium of the Indian lad to give the
cacique for so he seemed to be to understand that he wished to render
every one his own This offer was received as Amyas expected with
great applause and the canoe came alongside but the crew still seemed
afraid to land Amyas bade his men throw the fish one by one into the
boat and then proclaimed by the boys mouth as was his custom with all
Indians that he and his were enemies of the Spaniards and on their
way to make war against themand that all which they desired was a
peaceable and safe passage through the dominions of the mighty potentate
and renowned warrior whom they beheld before them for Amyas argued
rightly enough that even if the old fellow aft was not the cacique he
would be none the less pleased at being mistaken for him

Whereon the ancient worthy rising in the canoe pointed to heaven
earth and the things under and commenced a long sermon in tone
manner and articulation very like one of those which the great
blackbearded apes were in the habit of preaching every evening when
they could get together a congregation of little monkeys to listen to
the great scandal of Jack who would have it that some evil spirit set
them on to mimic him which sermon being partly interpreted by the
Indian lad seemed to signify that the valor and justice of the white
men had already reached the ears of the speaker and that he was sent to
welcome them into those regions by the Daughter of the Sun

The Daughter of the Sun quoth Amyas then we have found the lost
Incas after all

We have found something said Cary I only hope it may not be a
mares nest like many another of our finding

Or an adders said Yeo We must beware of treachery

We must beware of no such thing said Amyas pretty sharply Have I
not told you fifty times that if they see that we trust them they will
trust us and if they see that we suspect them they will suspect us
And when two parties are watching to see who strikes the first blow
they are sure to come to fisticuffs from mere dirty fear of each other

Amyas spoke truth for almost every atrocity against savages which had
been committed by the Spaniards and which was in later and worse times
committed by the English was wont to be excused in that same base fear
of treachery Amyass plan like that of Drake and Cook and all
great English voyagers had been all along to inspire at once awe
and confidence by a frank and fearless carriage and he was not
disappointed here He bade the men step boldly into their canoes and
follow the old Indian whither he would The simple children of the
forest bowed themselves reverently before the mighty strangers and then
led them smilingly across the stream and through a narrow passage in
the covert to a hidden lagoon on the banks of which stood not Manoa
but a tiny Indian village



CHAPTER XXIV

HOW AMYAS WAS TEMPTED OF THE DEVIL

 Let us alone What pleasure can we have
 To war with evil Is there any peace
 In always climbing up the climbing wave
 All things have rest and ripen toward the grave
 In silence ripen fall and cease
 Give us long rest or death dark death or dreamful ease

 TENNYSON

Humboldt has somewhere a curious passage in which looking on some
wretched group of Indians squatting stupidly round their fires
besmeared with grease and paint and devouring ants and clay he
somewhat naively remarks that were it not for science which teaches
us that such is the crude material of humanity and this the state from
which we all have risen he should have been tempted rather to look upon
those hapless beings as the last degraded remnants of some fallen and
dying race One wishes that the great traveller had been bold enough
to yield to that temptation which his own reason and common sense
presented to him as the real explanation of the sad sight instead
of following the dogmas of a socalled science which has not a fact
whereon to base its wild notion and must ignore a thousand facts in
asserting it His own good sense it seems coincided instinctively with
the Bible doctrine that man in a state of nature is a fallen being
doomed to deatha view which may be a sad one but still one more
honorable to poor humanity than the theory that we all began as some
sort of twohanded apes It is surely more hopeful to believe that those
poor Otomacs or Guahibas were not what they ought to be than to believe
that they were It is certainly more complimentary to them to think that
they had been somewhat nobler and more prudent in centuries gone by
than that they were such blockheads as to have dragged on the son after
the father for all the thousands of years which have elapsed since man
was made without having had wit enough to discover any better food than
ants and clay

Our voyagers however like those of their time troubled their heads
with no such questions Taking the Bible story as they found it they
agreed with Humboldts reason and not with his science or to speak
correctly agreed with Humboldts self and not with the shallow
anthropologic theories which happened to be in vogue fifty years ago
and their new hosts were in their eyes immortal souls like themselves
captivated by the devil at his will lost there in the pathless
forests likely to be lost hereafter

And certainly facts seemed to bear out their oldfashioned theories
although these Indians had sunk by no means so low as the Guahibas whom
they had met upon the lower waters of the same river

They beheld on landing a scattered village of palmleaf sheds under
which as usual the hammocks were slung from tree to tree Here
and there in openings in the forest patches of cassava and indigo
appeared and there was a look of neatness and comfort about the little
settlement superior to the average

But now for the signs of the evil spirit Certainly it was no good
spirit who had inspired them with the art of music or else as Cary
said Apollo and Mercury if they ever visited America had played their
forefathers a shabby trick and put them off with very poor instruments
and still poorer taste For on either side of the landingplace were
arranged four or five stout fellows each with a tall drum or long
earthen trumpet swelling out in the course of its length into several
hollow balls from which arose the moment the strangers set foot on
shore so deafening a cacophony of howls and groans and thumps as
fully to justify Yeos remark They are calling upon their devil sir
To which Cary answered with some show of reason that they were the
less likely to be disappointed for none but Sir Urian would ever come
to listen to such a noise

And you mark sirs said Yeo theres some feast or sacrifice toward
Im not overconfident of them yet

Nonsense said Amyas we could kill every soul of them in
halfanhour and they know that as well as we

But some great demonstration was plainly toward for the children of the
forest were arrayed in two lines right and left of the open space the
men in front and the women behind and all bedizened to the best of
their power with arnotto indigo and feathers

Next with a hideous yell leapt into the centre of the space a
personage who certainly could not have complained if any one had taken
him for the devil for he had dressed himself up carefully for that very
intent in a jaguarskin with a long tail grinning teeth a pair of
horns a plume of black and yellow feathers and a huge rattle

Heres the Piache the rascal says Amyas

Ay says Yeo in Satans livery and Ive no doubt his works are
according trust him for it

Dont be frightened Jack says Cary backing up Brimblecombe from
behind Its your business to tackle him you know At him boldly and
hell run

Whereat all the men laughed and the Piache who had intended to produce
a very solemn impression hung fire a little However being accustomed
to get his bread by his impudence he soon recovered himself advanced
smote one of the musicians over the head with his rattle to procure
silence and then began a harangue to which Amyas listened patiently
cigar in mouth

Whats it all about boy

He wants to know whether you have seen Amalivaca on the other shore of
the great water

Amyas was accustomed to this inquiry after the mythic civilizer of
the forest Indians who after carving the mysterious sculptures which
appear upon so many inland cliffs of that region returned again whence
he came beyond the ocean He answered as usual by setting forth the
praises of Queen Elizabeth

To which the Piache replied that she must be one of Amalivacas seven
daughters some of whom he took back with him while he broke the legs
of the rest to prevent their running away and left them to people the
forests

To which Amyas replied that his queens legs were certainly not broken
for she was a very model of grace and activity and the best dancer in
all her dominions but that it was more important to him to know whether
the tribe would give them cassava bread and let them stay peaceably on
that island to rest a while before they went on to fight the clothed
men the Spaniards on the other side of the mountains

On which the Piache after capering and turning head over heels with
much howling beckoned Amyas and his party to follow him they did so
seeing that the Indians were all unarmed and evidently in the highest
good humor

The Piache went toward the door of a carefully closed hut and crawling
up to it on allfours in most abject fashion began whining to some one
within

Ask what he is about boy

The lad asked the old cacique who had accompanied them and received
for answer that he was consulting the Daughter of the Sun

Here is our mares nest at last quoth Cary as the Piache from whines
rose to screams and gesticulations and then to violent convulsions
foaming at the mouth and rolling of the eyeballs till he suddenly sank
exhausted and lay for dead

As good as a stage play

The devil has played his part says Jack and now by the rules of all
plays Vice should come on

And a very fair Vice it will be I suspect a right sweet Iniquity my
Jack Listen

And from the interior of the hut rose a low sweet song at which all
the simple Indians bowed their heads in reverence and the English were
hushed in astonishment for the voice was not shrill or guttural like
that of an Indian but round clear and rich like a Europeans and as
it swelled and rose louder and louder showed a compass and power which
would have been extraordinary anywhere and many a man of the party
as was usual in musical old England was a good judge enough of such
a matter and could hold his part right well in glee and catch and
roundelay and psalm And as it leaped and ran and sank again and
rose once more to fall once more all but inarticulate yet perfect in
melody like the voice of bird on bough the wild wanderers were rapt
in new delight and did not wonder at the Indians as they bowed their
heads and welcomed the notes as messengers from some higher world At
last one triumphant burst so shrill that all ears rang again and then
dead silence The Piache suddenly restored to life jumped upright and
recommenced preaching at Amyas

Tell the howling villain to make short work of it lad His tune wont
do after that last one

The lad grinning informed Amyas that the Piache signified their
acceptance as friends by the Daughter of the Sun that her friends were
theirs and her foes theirs Whereon the Indians set up a scream of
delight and Amyas rolling another tobacco leaf up in another strip of
plantain answered

Then let her give us some cassava and lighted a fresh cigar

Whereon the door of the hut opened and the Indians prostrated
themselves to the earth as there came forth the same fair apparition
which they had encountered upon the island but decked now in
featherrobes and plumes of every imaginable hue

Slowly and stately as one accustomed to command she walked up to
Amyas glancing proudly round on her prostrate adorers and pointing
with graceful arms to the trees the gardens and the huts gave him to
understand by signs so expressive were her looks that no words were
needed that all was at his service after which taking his hand she
lifted it gently to her forehead

At that sign of submission a shout of rapture rose from the crowd and
as the mysterious maiden retired again to her hut they pressed round
the English caressing and admiring pointing with equal surprise to
their swords to their Indian bows and blowguns and to the trophies
of wild beasts with which they were clothed while women hastened off
to bring fruit and flowers and cassava and to Amyass great anxiety
calabashes of intoxicating drink and to make a long story short the
English sat down beneath the trees and feasted merrily while the drums
and trumpets made hideous music and lithe young girls and lads danced
uncouth dances which so scandalized both Brimblecombe and Yeo that
they persuaded Amyas to beat an early retreat He was willing enough
to get back to the island while the men were still sober so there were
many leavetakings and promises of return on the morrow and the party
paddled back to their islandfortress racking their wits as to who or
what the mysterious maid could be

Amyas however had settled in his mind that she was one of the lost
Inca race perhaps a descendant of that very fair girl wife of the
Inca Manco whom Pizarro forty years before had merely to torture
the fugitive kings heart as his body was safe from the tyrants reach
stripped scourged and shot to death with arrows uncomplaining to the
last

They all assembled for the evening service hardly a day had passed
since they left England on which they had not done the same and after
it was over they must needs sing a Psalm and then a catch or two ere
they went to sleep and till the moon was high in heaven twenty mellow
voices rang out above the roar of the cataract in many a good old tune
Once or twice they thought they heard an echo to their song but they
took no note of it till Cary who had gone apart for a few minutes
returned and whispered Amyas away

The sweet Iniquity is mimicking us lad

They went to the brink of the river and there for their ears were by
this time dead to the noise of the torrent they could hear plainly the
same voice which had so surprised them in the hut repeating clear
and true snatches of the airs which they had sung Strange and solemn
enough was the effect of the mens deep voices on the island answered
out of the dark forest by those sweet treble notes and the two young
men stood a long while listening and looking out across the eddies
which swirled down golden in the moonlight but they could see nothing
beyond save the black wall of trees After a while the voice ceased and
the two returned to dream of Incas and nightingales

They visited the village again next day and every day for a week or
more but the maiden appeared but rarely and when she did kept her
distance as haughtily as a queen

Amyas of course as soon as he could converse somewhat better with his
new friends was not long before he questioned the cacique about
her But the old man made an owls face at her name and intimated by
mysterious shakes of the head that she was a very strange personage
and the less said about her the better She was a child of the Sun
and that was enough

Tell him boy quoth Cary that we are the children of the Sun by
his first wife and have orders from him to inquire how the Indians
have behaved to our stepsister for he cannot see all their tricks down
here the trees are so thick So let him tell us or all the cassava
plants shall be blighted

Will Will dont play with lying said Amyas but the threat was
enough for the cacique and taking them in his canoe a full mile down
the stream as if in fear that the wonderful maiden should overhear him
he told them in a sort of rhythmic chant how many moons ago he
could not tell how many his tribe was a mighty nation and dwelt in
Papamene till the Spaniards drove them forth And how as they wandered
northward far away upon the mountain spurs beneath the flaming cone
of Cotopaxi they had found this fair creature wandering in the forest
about the bigness of a seven years child Wondering at her white skin
and her delicate beauty the simple Indians worshipped her as a god
and led her home with them And when they found that she was human like
themselves their wonder scarcely lessened How could so tender a being
have sustained life in those forests and escaped the jaguar and the
snake She must be under some Divine protection she must be a daughter
of the Sun one of that mighty Inca race the news of whose fearful
fall had reached even those lonely wildernesses who had many of them
haunted for years as exiles the eastern slopes of the Andes about the
Ucalayi and the Maranon who would as all Indians knew rise again
some day to power when bearded white men should come across the seas to
restore them to their ancient throne

So as the girl grew up among them she was tended with royal honors
by command of the conjuror of the tribe that so her forefather the Sun
might be propitious to them and the Incas might show favor to the poor
ruined Omaguas in the day of their coming glory And as she grew she
had become it seemed somewhat of a prophetess among them as well
as an object of fetishworship for she was more prudent in council
valiant in war and cunning in the chase than all the elders of the
tribe and those strange and sweet songs of hers which had so surprised
the white men were full of mysterious wisdom about the birds and the
animals and the flowers and the rivers which the Sun and the Good
Spirit taught her from above So she had lived among them unmarried
still not only because she despised the addresses of all Indian youths
but because the conjuror had declared it to be profane in them to mingle
with the race of the Sun and had assigned her a cabin near his own
where she was served in state and gave some sort of oracular responses
as they had seen to the questions which he put to her

Such was the caciques tale on which Cary remarked probably not
unjustly that he dared to say the conjuror made a very good thing of
it but Amyas was silent full of dreams if not about Manoa still
about the remnant of the Inca race What if they were still to be found
about the southern sources of the Amazon He must have been very near
them already in that case It was vexatious but at least he might
be sure that they had formed no great kingdom in that direction or he
should have heard of it long ago Perhaps they had moved lately from
thence eastward to escape some fresh encroachment of the Spaniards and
this girl had been left behind in their flight And then he recollected
with a sigh how hopeless was any further search with his diminished
band At least he might learn something of the truth from the maiden
herself It might be useful to him in some future attempt for he
had not yet given up Manoa If he but got safe home there was many a
gallant gentleman and Raleigh came at once into his mind who would
join him in a fresh search for the Golden City of Guiana not by the
upper waters but by the mouth of the Orinoco

So they paddled back while the simple cacique entreated them to tell
the Sun in their daily prayers how well the wild people had treated
his descendant and besought them not to take her away with them lest
the Sun should forget the poor Omaguas and ripen their manioc and their
fruit no more

Amyas had no wish to stay where he was longer than was absolutely
necessary to bring up the sick men from the Orinoco but this he well
knew would be a journey probably of some months and attended with much
danger

Cary volunteered at once however to undertake the adventure if
halfadozen men would join him and the Indians would send a few young
men to help in working the canoe but this latter item was not an easy
one to obtain for the tribe with whom they now were stood in some fear
of the fierce and brutal Guahibas through whose country they must pass
and every Indian tribe as Amyas knew well enough looks on each tribe
of different language to itself as natural enemies hateful and made
only to be destroyed wherever met This strange fact too Amyas and his
party attributed to delusion of the devil the divider and accuser and
I am of opinion that they were perfectly right only let Amyas take care
that while he is discovering the devil in the Indians he does not give
place to him in himself and that in more ways than one But of that
more hereafter

Whether however it was pride or shyness which kept the maiden aloof
she conquered it after a while perhaps through mere womans curiosity
and perhaps too from mere longing for amusement in a place so
unspeakably stupid as the forest She gave the English to understand
however that though they all might be very important personages none
of them was to be her companion but Amyas And ere a month was past she
was often hunting with him far and wide in the neighboring forest with
a train of chosen nymphs whom she had persuaded to follow her example
and spurn the dusky suitors around This fashion not uncommon perhaps
among the Indian tribes where women are continually escaping to
the forest from the tyranny of the men and often perhaps forming
temporary communities was to the English a plain proof that they were
near the land of the famous Amazons of whom they had heard so often
from the Indians while Amyas had no doubt that as a descendant of the
Incas the maiden preserved the tradition of the Virgins of the Sun and
of the austere monastic rule of the Peruvian superstition Had not that
valiant German George of Spires and Jeronimo Ortal too fifty years
before found convents of the Sun upon these very upper waters

So a harmless friendship sprang up between Amyas and the girl which
soon turned to good account For she no sooner heard that he needed a
crew of Indians than she consulted the Piache assembled the tribe and
having retired to her hut commenced a song which unless the Piache
lied was a command to furnish young men for Carys expedition
under penalty of the sovereign displeasure of an evil spirit with an
unpronounceable namean argument which succeeded on the spot and the
canoe departed on its perilous errand

John Brimblecombe had great doubts whether a venture thus started by
direct help and patronage of the fiend would succeed and Amyas himself
disliking the humbug told Ayacanora that it would be better to have
told the tribe that it was a good deed and pleasing to the Good Spirit

Ah said she naively enough they know better than that The Good
Spirit is big and lazy and he smiles and takes no trouble but the
little bad spirit he is so busyhere and there and everywhere and
she waved her pretty hands up and down he is the useful one to have
for a friend Which sentiment the Piache much approved as became his
occupation and once told Brimblecombe pretty sharply that he was a
meddlesome fellow for telling the Indians that the Good Spirit cared for
them for quoth he if they begin to ask the Good Spirit for what
they want who will bring me cassava and coca for keeping the bad spirit
quiet This argument however forcible the devils priests in all ages
have felt it to be did not stop Jacks preaching and very good and
righteous preaching it was moreover and much less the morning and
evening service in the island camp This last the Indians attracted
by the singing attended in such numbers that the Piache found his
occupation gone and vowed to put an end to Jacks Gospel with a
poisoned arrow

Which plan he blinded by his master Satan so Jack phrased it took
into his head to impart to Ayacanora as the partner of his tithes and
offerings and was exceedingly astonished to receive in answer a box on
the ear and a storm of abuse After which Ayacanora went to Amyas
and telling him all proposed that the Piache should be thrown to the
alligators and Jack installed in his place declaring that whatsoever
the bearded men said must be true and whosoever plotted against them
should die the death

Jack however magnanimously forgave his foe and preached on of course
with fresh zeal but not alas with much success For the conjuror
though his main treasure was gone over to the camp of the enemy had a
reserve in a certain holy trumpet which was hidden mysteriously in a
cave on the neighboring hills not to be looked on by woman under pain
of death and it was well known and had been known for generations
that unless that trumpet after fastings flagellations and other
solemn rites was blown by night throughout the woods the palmtrees
would bear no fruit yea so great was the fame of that trumpet that
neighboring tribes sent at the proper season to hire it and the blower
thereof by payment of much precious trumpery that so they might be
sharers in its fertilizing powers

So the Piache announced one day in public that in consequence of the
impiety of the Omaguas he should retire to a neighboring tribe of more
religious turn of mind and taking with him the precious instrument
leave their palms to blight and themselves to the evil spirit

Dire was the wailing and dire the wrath throughout the village
Jacks words were allowed to be good words but what was the Gospel in
comparison of the trumpet The rascal saw his advantage and began
a fierce harangue against the heretic strangers As he maddened his
hearers maddened the savage nature capricious as a childs flashed
out in wild suspicion Women yelled men scowled and ran hastily to
their huts for bows and blowguns The case was grown critical There
were not more than a dozen men with Amyas at the time and they had only
their swords while the Indian men might muster nearly a hundred Amyas
forbade his men either to draw or to retreat but poisoned arrows were
weapons before which the boldest might well quail and more than one
cheek grew pale which had seldom been pale before

It is Gods quarrel sirs all said Jack Brimblecombe let Him defend
the right

As he spoke from Ayacanoras hut arose her magic song and quivered
aloft among the green heights of the forest

The mob stood spellbound still growling fiercely but not daring to
move Another moment and she had rushed out like a very Diana into
the centre of the ring bow in hand and arrow on the string

The fallen children of wrath had found their match in her for her
beautiful face was convulsed with fury Almost foaming in her passion
she burst forth with bitter revilings she pointed with admiration to
the English and then with fiercest contempt to the Indians and at
last with fierce gestures seemed to cast off the very dust of her
feet against them and springing to Amyass side placed herself in the
forefront of the English battle

The whole scene was so sudden that Amyas had hardly discovered whether
she came as friend or foe before her bow was raised He had just time
to strike up her hand when the arrow flew past the ear of the offending
Piache and stuck quivering in a tree

Let me kill the wretch said she stamping with rage but Amyas held
her arm firmly

Fools cried she to the tribe while tears of anger rolled down her
cheeks Choose between me and your trumpet I am a daughter of the Sun
I am white I am a companion for Englishmen But you your mothers were
Guahibas and ate mud and your fathersthey were howling apes Let
them sing to you I shall go to the white men and never sing you to
sleep any more and when the little evil spirit misses my voice he will
come and tumble you out of your hammocks and make you dream of ghosts
every night till you grow as thin as blowguns and as stupid as
ayeayes

  Twotoed sloths

This terrible counterthreat in spite of the slight bathos involved
had its effect for it appealed to that dread of the sleep world which
is common to all savages but the conjuror was ready to outbid the
prophetess and had begun a fresh oration when Amyas turned the tide
of war Bursting into a huge laugh at the whole matter he took the
conjuror by his shoulders sent him with one crafty kick halfadozen
yards off upon his nose and then walking out of the ranks shook hands
round with all his Indian acquaintances

Whereon like grownup babies they all burst out laughing too shook
hands with all the English and then with each other being after all
as glad as any bishops to prorogue the convocation and let unpleasant
questions stand over till the next session The Piache relented like
a prudent man Ayacanora returned to her hut to sulk and Amyas to his
island to long for Carys return for he felt himself on dangerous
ground

At last Will returned safe and sound and as merry as ever not having
lost a man though he had had a smart brush with the Guahibas He
brought back three of the wounded men now pretty nigh cured the other
two who had lost a leg apiece had refused to come They had Indian
wives more than they could eat and tobacco without end and if it were
not for the gnats of which Cary said that there were more mosquitoes
than there was air they should be the happiest men alive Amyas could
hardly blame the poor fellows for the chance of their getting home
through the forest with one leg each was very small and after all
they were making the best of a bad matter And a very bad matter it
seemed to him to be left in a heathen land and a still worse matter
when he overheard some of the men talking about their comrades lonely
fate as if after all they were not so much to be pitied He said
nothing about it then for he made a rule never to take notice of any
facts which he got at by eavesdropping however unintentional but he
longed that one of them would say as much to him and he would give
them a piece of his mind And a piece of his mind he had to give within
the week for while he was on a hunting party two of his men were
missing and were not heard of for some days at the end of which time
the old cacique come to tell him that he believed they had taken to the
forest each with an Indian girl

Amyas was very wroth at the news First because it had never happened
before he could say with honest pride as Raleigh did afterwards when
he returned from his Guiana voyage that no Indian woman had ever been
the worse for any man of his He had preached on this point month after
month and practised what he preached and now his pride was sorely
hurt

Moreover he dreaded offence to the Indians themselves but on this
score the cacique soon comforted him telling him that the girls as far
as he could find had gone off of their own free will intimating that
he thought it somewhat an honor to the tribe that they had found favor
in the eyes of the bearded men and moreover that late wars had so
thinned the ranks of their men that they were glad enough to find
husbands for their maidens and had been driven of late years to kill
many of their female infants This sad story common perhaps to every
American tribe and one of the chief causes of their extermination
reassured Amyas somewhat but he could not stomach either the loss of
his men or their breach of discipline and look for them he would Did
any one know where they were If the tribe knew they did not care to
tell but Ayacanora the moment she found out his wishes vanished into
the forest and returned in two days saying that she had found the
fugitives but she would not show him where they were unless he
promised not to kill them He of course had no mind for so rigorous a
method he both needed the men and he had no malice against themfor
the one Ebsworthy was a plain honest happygolucky sailor and
as good a hand as there was in the crew and the other was that same
neerdoweel Will Parracombe his old schoolfellow who had been
tempted by the gipsyJesuit at Appledore and resisting that bait had
made a very fair seaman

So forth Amyas went with Ayacanora as a guide some five miles upward
along the forest slopes till the girl whispered There they are
and Amyas pushing himself gently through a thicket of bamboo beheld
a scene which in spite of his wrath kept him silent and perhaps
softened for a minute

On the farther side of a little lawn the stream leapt through a chasm
beneath overarching vines sprinkling eternal freshness upon all around
and then sank foaming into a clear rockbasin a bath for Dians self
On its farther side the crag rose some twenty feet in height bank upon
bank of feathered ferns and cushioned moss over the rich green beds of
which drooped a thousand orchids scarlet white and orange and made
the still pool gorgeous with the reflection of their gorgeousness At
its more quiet outfall it was halfhidden in huge fantastic leaves and
tall flowering stems but near the waterfall the grassy bank sloped
down toward the stream and there on palmleaves strewed upon the turf
beneath the shadow of the crags lay the two men whom Amyas sought
and whom now he had found them he had hardly heart to wake from their
delicious dream

For what a nest it was which they had found the air was heavy with
the scent of flowers and quivering with the murmur of the stream the
humming of the colibris and insects the cheerful song of birds the
gentle cooing of a hundred doves while now and then from far away
the musical wail of the sloth or the deep toll of the bellbird came
softly to the ear What was not there which eye or ear could need And
what which palate could need either For on the rock above some strange
tree leaning forward dropped every now and then a luscious apple upon
the grass below and huge wild plantains bent beneath their load of
fruit

There on the stream bank lay the two renegades from civilized life
They had cast away their clothes and painted themselves like the
Indians with arnotto and indigo One lay lazily picking up the fruit
which fell close to his side the other sat his back against a cushion
of soft moss his hands folded languidly upon his lap giving himself up
to the soft influence of the narcotic cocajuice with halfshut dreamy
eyes fixed on the everlasting sparkle of the waterfall

 While beauty born of murmuring sound
 Did pass into his face

Somewhat apart crouched their two dusky brides crowned with fragrant
flowers but working busily like true women for the lords whom they
delighted to honor One sat plaiting palm fibres into a basket the
other was boring the stem of a huge milktree which rose like some
mighty column on the right hand of the lawn its broad canopy of leaves
unseen through the dense underwood of laurel and bamboo and betokened
only by the rustle far aloft and by the mellow shade in which it bathed
the whole delicious scene

Amyas stood silent for awhile partly from noble shame at seeing two
Christian men thus fallen of their own selfwill partly becauseand
he could not but confess thata solemn calm brooded above that glorious
place to break through which seemed sacrilege even while he felt it
a duty Such he thought was Paradise of old such our first parents
bridal bower Ah if man had not fallen he too might have dwelt forever
in such a homewith whom He started and shaking off the spell
advanced sword in hand

The women saw him and springing to their feet caught up their long
pocunas and leapt like deer each in front of her beloved There they
stood the deadly tubes pressed to their lips eyeing him like tigresses
who protect their young while every slender limb quivered not with
terror but with rage

Amyas paused half in admiration half in prudence for one rash step
was death But rushing through the canes Ayacanora sprang to the front
and shrieked to them in Indian At the sight of the prophetess the women
wavered and Amyas putting on as gentle a face as he could stepped
forward assuring them in his best Indian that he would harm no one

Ebsworthy Parracombe Are you grown such savages already that you
have forgotten your captain Stand up men and salute

Ebsworthy sprang to his feet obeyed mechanically and then slipped
behind his bride again as if in shame The dreamer turned his head
languidly raised his hand to his forehead and then returned to his
contemplation

Amyas rested the point of his sword on the ground and his hands upon
the hilt and looked sadly and solemnly upon the pair Ebsworthy broke
the silence half reproachfully half trying to bluster away the coming
storm

Well noble captain so youve hunted out us poor fellows and want to
drag us back again in a halter I suppose

I came to look for Christians and I find heathens for men and I find
swine I shall leave the heathens to their wilderness and the swine to
their trough Parracombe

Hes too happy to answer you sir And why not What do you want of us
Our two years vow is out and we are free men now

Free to become like the beasts that perish You are the queens
servants still and in her name I charge you

Free to be happy interrupted the man With the best of wives the
best of food a warmer bed than a dukes and a finer garden than an
emperors As for clothes why the plague should a man wear them where
he dont need them As for gold whats the use of it where Heaven sends
everything readymade to your hands Hearken Captain Leigh Youve been
a good captain to me and Ill repay you with a bit of sound advice
Give up your goldhunting and toiling and moiling after honor and
glory and copy us Take that fair maid behind you there to wife pitch
here with us and see if you are not happier in one day than ever you
were in all your life before

You are drunk sirrah William Parracombe Will you speak to me or
shall I heave you into the stream to sober you

Who calls William Parracombe answered a sleepy voice

I foolyour captain

I am not William Parracombe He is dead long ago of hunger and labor
and heavy sorrow and will never see Bideford town any more He is
turned into an Indian now and he is to sleep sleep sleep for a
hundred years till he gets his strength again poor fellow

Awake then thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ
shall give thee light A christened Englishman and living thus the life
of a beast

Christ shall give thee light answered the same unnatural abstracted
voice Yes so the parsons say And they say too that He is Lord of
heaven and earth I should have thought His light was as near us here
as anywhere and nearer too by the look of the place Look round
said he waving a lazy hand and see the works of God and the place of
Paradise whither poor weary souls go home and rest after their masters
in the wicked world have used them up with labor and sorrow and made
them wade kneedeep in bloodIm tired of blood and tired of gold
Ill march no more Ill fight no more Ill hunger no more after vanity
and vexation of spirit What shall I get by it Maybe I shall leave my
bones in the wilderness I can but do that here Maybe I shall get home
with a few pezos to die an old cripple in some stinking hovel that a
monkey would scorn to lodge in here You may go on itll pay you You
may be a rich man and a knight and live in a fine house and drink
good wine and go to Court and torment your soul with trying to
get more when youve got too much already plotting and planning to
scramble upon your neighbors shoulders as they all didSir Richard
and Mr Raleigh and Chichester and poor dear old Sir Warham and all
of them that I used to watch when I lived before They were no happier
than I was then Ill warrant they are no happier now Go your ways
captain climb to glory upon some other backs than ours and leave us
here in peace alone with God and Gods woods and the good wives that
God has given us to play a little like school children Its long since
Ive had playhours and now Ill be a little child once more with the
flowers and the singing birds and the silver fishes in the stream
that are at peace and think no harm and want neither clothes nor
money nor knighthood nor peerage but just take what comes and their
heavenly Father feedeth them and Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of theseand will He not much more feed us that are
of more value than many sparrows

And will you live here shut out from all Christian ordinances

Christian ordinances Adam and Eve had no parsons in Paradise The Lord
was their priest and the Lord was their shepherd and Hell be ours
too But go your ways sir and send up Sir John Brimblecombe and let
him marry us here Church fashion though we have sworn troth to each
other before God already and let him give us the Holy Sacrament once
and for all and then read the funeral service over us and go his ways
and count us for dead sirfor dead we are to the wicked worthless
world we came out of three years ago And when the Lord chooses to call
us the little birds will cover us with leaves as they did the babies
in the wood and fresher flowers will grow out of our graves sir than
out of yours in that bare Northam churchyard there beyond the weary
weary weary sea

His voice died away to a murmur and his head sank on his breast

Amyas stood spellbound The effect of the narcotic was all but
miraculous in his eyes The sustained eloquence the novel richness of
diction in one seemingly drowned in sensual sloth were in his eyes
the possession of some evil spirit And yet he could not answer the Evil
One His English heart full of the divine instinct of duty and public
spirit told him that it must be a lie but how to prove it a lie And
he stood for full ten minutes searching for an answer which seemed to
fly farther and farther off the more he sought for it

His eye glanced upon Ayacanora The two girls were whispering to her
smilingly He saw one of them glance a look toward him and then say
something which raised a beautiful blush in the maidens face With a
playful blow at the speaker she turned away Amyas knew instinctively
that they were giving her the same advice as Ebsworthy had given to him
Oh how beautiful she was Might not the renegades have some reason on
their side after all

He shuddered at the thought but he could not shake it off It glided
in like some gaudy snake and wreathed its coils round all his heart
and brain He drew back to the other side of the lawn and thought and
thought

Should he ever get home If he did might he not get home a beggar
Beggar or rich he would still have to face his mother to go through
that meeting to tell that tale perhaps to hear those reproaches the
forecast of which had weighed on him like a dark thundercloud for two
weary years to wipe out which by some desperate deed of glory he had
wandered the wilderness and wandered in vain

Could he not settle here He need not be a savage he and his might
Christianize civilize teach equal law mercy in war chivalry to
women found a community which might be hereafter as strong a barrier
against the encroachments of the Spaniard as Manoa itself would have
been Who knew the wealth of the surrounding forests Even if there were
no gold there were boundless vegetable treasures What might he not
export down the rivers This might be the nucleus of a great commercial
settlement

And yet was even that worth while To settle here only to torment
his soul with fresh schemes fresh ambitions not to rest but only to
change one labor for another Was not your dreamer right Did they not
all need rest What if they each sat down among the flowers beside an
Indian bride They might live like Christians while they lived like the
birds of heaven

What a dead silence He looked up and round the birds had ceased to
chirp the parroquets were hiding behind the leaves the monkeys were
clustered motionless upon the highest twigs only out of the far depths
of the forest the campanero gave its solemn toll once twice thrice
like a great deathknell rolling down from far cathedral towers Was
it an omen He looked up hastily at Ayacanora She was watching him
earnestly Heavens was she waiting for his decision Both dropped their
eyes The decision was not to come from them

A rustle a roar a shriek and Amyas lifted his eyes in time to see a
huge dark bar shoot from the crag above the dreamers head among the
group of girls

A dull crash as the group flew asunder and in the midst upon the
ground the tawny limbs of one were writhing beneath the fangs of a
black jaguar the rarest and most terrible of the forest kings Of one
But of which Was it Ayacanora And sword in hand Amyas rushed madly
forward before he reached the spot those tortured limbs were still

It was not Ayacanora for with a shriek which rang through the woods
the wretched dreamer wakened thus at last sprang up and felt for his
sword Fool he had left it in his hammock Screaming the name of his
dead bride he rushed on the jaguar as it crouched above its prey and
seizing its head with teeth and nails worried it in the ferocity of
his madness like a mastiffdog

The brute wrenched its head from his grasp and raised its dreadful paw
Another moment and the husbands corpse would have lain by the wifes

But high in air gleamed Amyass blade down with all the weight of his
huge body and strong arm fell that most trusty steel the head of the
jaguar dropped grinning on its victims corpse

 And all stood still who saw him fall
 While men might count a score

O Lord Jesus said Amyas to himself Thou hast answered the devil
for me And this is the selfish rest for which I would have bartered the
rest which comes by working where Thou hast put me

They bore away the lithe corpse into the forest and buried it under
soft moss and virgin mould and so the fair clay was transfigured into
fairer flowers and the poor gentle untaught spirit returned to God
who gave it

And then Amyas went sadly and silently back again and Parracombe walked
after him like one who walks in sleep

Ebsworthy sobered by the shock entreated to come too but Amyas
forbade him gently

No lad you are forgiven God forbid that I should judge you or any
man Sir John shall come up and marry you and then if it still be your
will to stay the Lord forgive you if you be wrong in the meanwhile
we will leave with you all that we can spare Stay here and pray to God
to make you and me too wiser men

And so Amyas departed He had come out stern and proud but he came back
again like a little child

Three days after Parracombe was dead Once in camp he seemed unable to
eat or move and having received absolution and communion from good Sir
John faded away without disease or pain babbling of green fields
and murmuring the name of his lost Indian bride

Amyas too sought ghostly council of Sir John and told him all which
had passed through his mind

It was indeed a temptation of Diabolus said that simple sage for he
is by his very name the divider who sets man against man and tempts
one to care only for oneself and forget kin and country and duty
and queen But you have resisted him Captain Leigh like a trueborn
Englishman as you always are and he has fled from you But that is no
reason why we should not flee from him too and so I think the sooner we
are out of this place and at work again the better for all our souls

To which Amyas most devoutly said Amen If Ayacanora were the
daughter of ten thousand Incas he must get out of her way as soon as
possible

The next day he announced his intention to march once more and to
his delight found the men ready enough to move towards the Spanish
settlements One thing they needed gunpowder for their muskets But
that they must make as they went along that is if they could get the
materials Charcoal they could procure enough to set the world on fire
but nitre they had not yet seen perhaps they should find it among the
hills while as for sulphur any brave man could get that where there
were volcanoes Who had not heard how one of Cortez Spaniards in like
need was lowered in a basket down the smoking crater of Popocatepetl
till he had gathered sulphur enough to conquer an empire And what a
Spaniard could do an Englishman could do or they would know the reason
why And if they found nonewhy clothyard arrows had done Englishmens
work many a time already and they could do it again not to mention
those same blowguns and their arrows of curare poison which though
they might be useless against Spaniards armor were far more valuable
than muskets for procuring food from the simple fact of their silence

One thing remained to invite their Indian friends to join them And
that was done in due form the next day

Ayacanora was consulted of course and by the Piache too who was glad
enough to be rid of the rival preacher and his unpleasantly good news
that men need not worship the devil because there was a good God above
them The maiden sang most melodious assent the whole tribe echoed it
and all went smoothly enough till the old cacique observed that before
starting a compact should be made between the allies as to their share
of the booty

Nothing could be more reasonable and Amyas asked him to name his terms

You take the gold and we will take the prisoners

And what will you do with them asked Amyas who recollected poor John
Oxenhams hapless compact made in like case

Eat them quoth the cacique innocently enough

Amyas whistled

Humph said Cary The old proverb comes truethe more the merrier
but the fewer the better fare I think we will do without our red
friends for this time

Ayacanora who had been preaching war like a very Boadicea was much
vexed

Do you too want to dine off roast Spaniards asked Amyas

She shook her head and denied the imputation with much disgust

Amyas was relieved he had shrunk from joining the thought of so fair a
creature however degraded with the horrors of cannibalism

But the cacique was a man of business and held out stanchly

Is it fair he asked The white man loves gold and he gets it The
poor Indian what use is gold to him He only wants something to eat
and he must eat his enemies What else will pay him for going so far
through the forests hungry and thirsty You will get all and the
Omaguas will get nothing

The argument was unanswerable and the next day they started without the
Indians while John Brimblecombe heaved many an honest sigh at leaving
them to darkness the devil and the holy trumpet

And Ayacanora

When their departure was determined she shut herself up in her hut and
appeared no more Great was the weeping howling and leavetaking on
the part of the simple Indians and loud the entreaties to come again
bring them a message from Amalivacas daughter beyond the seas and help
them to recover their lost land of Papamene but Ayacanora took no part
in them and Amyas left her wondering at her absence but joyful and
lighthearted at having escaped the rocks of the Sirens and being at
work once more



CHAPTER XXV

HOW THEY TOOK THE GOLDTRAIN

 God will relent and quit thee all thy debt
 Who ever more approves and more accepts
 Him who imploring mercy sues for life
 Than who selfrigorous chooses death as due
 Which argues overjust and selfdispleased
 For selfoffence more than for God offended

 Samson Agonistes

A fortnight or more has passed in severe toil but not more severe than
they have endured many a time before Bidding farewell once and
forever to the green ocean of the eastern plains they have crossed the
Cordillera they have taken a longing glance at the city of Santa Fe
lying in the midst of rich gardens on its lofty mountain plateau and
have seen as was to be expected that it was far too large a place for
any attempt of theirs But they have not altogether thrown away their
time Their Indian lad has discovered that a goldtrain is going down
from Santa Fe toward the Magdalena and they are waiting for it beside
the miserable rut which serves for a road encamped in a forest of oaks
which would make them almost fancy themselves back again in Europe were
it not for the treeferns which form the undergrowth and were it not
too for the deep gorges opening at their very feet in which while
their brows are swept by the cool breezes of a temperate zone they
can see far below dim through their everlasting vaporbath of rank hot
steam the mighty forms and gorgeous colors of the tropic forest

They have pitched their camp among the treeferns above a spot where
the path winds along a steep hillside with a sheer cliff below of many
a hundred feet There was a road there once perhaps when Cundinamarca
was a civilized and cultivated kingdom but all which Spanish misrule
has left of it are a few steps slipping from their places at the bottom
of a narrow ditch of mud It has gone the way of the aqueducts and
bridges and posthouses the gardens and the llamaflocks of that
strange empire In the mad search for gold every art of civilization
has fallen to decay save architecture alone and that survives only in
the splendid cathedrals which have risen upon the ruins of the temples
of the Sun in honor of a milder Pantheon if indeed that can be
called a milder one which demands as we have seen already human
sacrifices unknown to the gentle natureworship of the Incas

And now the rapid tropic vegetation has reclaimed its old domains
and Amyas and his crew are as utterly alone within a few miles of an
important Spanish settlement as they would be in the solitudes of the
Orinoco or the Amazon

In the meanwhile all their attempts to find sulphur and nitre have been
unavailing and they have been forced to depend after all much to Yeos
disgust upon their swords and arrows Be it so Drake took Nombre de
Dios and the goldtrain there with no better weapons and they may do as
much

So having blocked up the road above by felling a large tree across it
they sit there among the flowers chewing coca in default of food and
drink and meditating among themselves the cause of a mysterious roar
which has been heard nightly in their wake ever since they left the
banks of the Meta Jaguar it is not nor monkey it is unlike any sound
they know and why should it follow them However they are in the land
of wonders and moreover the gold train is far more important than any
noise

At last up from beneath there was a sharp crack and a loud cry
The crack was neither the snapping of a branch nor the tapping of a
woodpecker the cry was neither the scream of the parrot nor the howl
of the monkey

That was a whips crack said Yeo and a womans wail They are close
here lads

A womans Do they drive women in their gangs asked Amyas

Why not the brutes There they are sir Did you see their basnets
glitter

Men said Amyas in a low voice I trust you all not to shoot till
I do Then give them one arrow out swords and at them Pass the word
along

Up they came slowly and all hearts beat loud at their coming

First about twenty soldiers only onehalf of whom were on foot the
other half being borne incredible as it may seem each in a chair on
the back of a single Indian while those who marched had consigned their
heaviest armor and their arquebuses into the hands of attendant slaves
who were each pricked on at will by the pike of the soldier behind them

The men are mad to let their ordnance out of their hands

Oh sir an Indian will pray to an arquebus not to shoot him he sure
their artillery is safe enough said Yeo

Look at the proud villains whispered another to make dumb beasts of
human creatures like that

Ten shot counted the businesslike Amyas and ten pikes Will can
tackle them up above

Last of this troop came some inferior officer also in his chair who
as he went slowly up the hill with his face turned toward the gang
which followed drew every other second the cigar from his lips to
inspirit them with those pious ejaculations to the various objects of
his worship divine human anatomic wooden and textile which earned
for the pious Spaniards of the sixteenth century the uncharitable
imputation of being at once the most fetishridden idolaters and the
most abominable swearers of all Europeans

The blasphemous dog said Yeo fumbling at his bowstring as if
he longed to send an arrow through him But Amyas had hardly laid his
finger on the impatient veterans arm when another procession followed
which made them forget all else

A sad and hideous sight it was yet one too common even then in those
remoter districts where the humane edicts were disregarded which the
prayers of Dominican friars to their everlasting honor be it spoken
had wrung from the Spanish sovereigns and which the legislation of that
most wise virtuous and heroic Inquisitor paradoxical as the words may
seem Pedro de la Gasca had carried into effect in Perufutile and
tardy alleviations of cruelties and miseries unexampled in the
history of Christendom or perhaps on earth save in the conquests of
Sennacherib and Zingis Khan But on the frontiers where negroes were
imported to endure the toil which was found fatal to the Indian and all
Indian tribes convicted or suspected of cannibalism were hunted down
for the salvation of their souls and the enslavement of their bodies
such scenes as these were still too common and indeed if we are to
judge from Humboldts impartial account were not very much amended even
at the close of the last century in those muchboasted Jesuit missions
in which as many of them as existed anywhere but on paper military
tyranny was superadded to monastic and the Gospel preached with fire
and sword almost as shamelessly as by the first Conquistadores

A line of Indians Negroes and Zambos naked emaciated scarred with
whips and fetters and chained together by their left wrists toiled
upwards panting and perspiring under the burden of a basket held up
by a strap which passed across their foreheads Yeos sneer was but
too just there were not only old men and youths among them but women
slender young girls mothers with children running at their knee
and at the sight a low murmur of indignation rose from the ambushed
Englishmen worthy of the free and righteous hearts of those days when
Raleigh could appeal to man and God on the ground of a common humanity
in behalf of the outraged heathens of the New World when Englishmen
still knew that man was man and that the instinct of freedom was
the righteous voice of God ere the hapless seventeenth century had
brutalized them also by bestowing on them amid a hundred other bad
legacies the fatal gift of negroslaves

But the first forty so Amyas counted bore on their backs a burden
which made all perhaps but him and Yeo forget even the wretches who
bore it Each basket contained a square package of carefully corded
hide the look whereof friend Amyas knew full well

Whats in they captain

Gold And at that magic word all eyes were strained greedily forward
and such a rustle followed that Amyas in the very face of detection
had to whisper

Be men be men or you will spoil all yet

The last twenty or so of the Indians bore larger baskets but more
lightly freighted seemingly with manioc and maizebread and other
food for the party and after them came with their bearers and
attendants just twenty soldiers more followed by the officer in
charge who smiled away in his chair and twirled two huge mustachios
thinking of nothing less than of the English arrows which were itching
to be away and through his ribs The ambush was complete the only
question how and when to begin

Amyas had a shrinking which all will understand from drawing bow in
cool blood on men so utterly unsuspicious and defenceless even though
in the very act of devilish crueltyfor devilish cruelty it was as
three or four drivers armed with whips lingered up and down the slowly
staggering file of Indians and avenged every moments lagging even
every stumble by a blow of the cruel manatihide which cracked like
a pistolshot against the naked limbs of the silent and uncomplaining
victim

Suddenly the casus belli as usually happens arose of its own accord

The last but one of the chained line was an old grayheaded man
followed by a slender graceful girl of some eighteen years old and
Amyass heart yearned over them as they came up Just as they passed
the foremost of the file had rounded the corner above there was a
bustle and a voice shouted Halt senors there is a tree across the
path

A tree across the path bellowed the officer with a variety of
passionate addresses to the Mother of Heaven the fiends of hell Saint
Jago of Compostella and various other personages while the line of
trembling Indians told to halt above and driven on by blows below
surged up and down upon the ruinous steps of the Indian road until the
poor old man fell grovelling on his face

The officer leaped down and hurried upward to see what had happened Of
course he came across the old man

Sin peccado concebida Grandfather of Beelzebub is this a place to lie
worshipping your fiends and he pricked the prostrate wretch with the
point of his sword

The old man tried to rise but the weight on his head was too much for
him he fell again and lay motionless

The driver applied the manatihide across his loins once twice with
fearful force but even that specific was useless

Gastado Senor Capitan said he with a shrug Used up He has been
failing these three months

What does the intendant mean by sending me out with wornout cattle
like these Forward there shouted he Clear away the tree senors
and Ill soon clear the chain Hold it up Pedrillo

The driver held up the chain which was fastened to the old mans wrist
The officer stepped back and flourished round his head a Toledo blade
whose beauty made Amyas break the Tenth Commandment on the spot

The man was a tall handsome broadshouldered highbred man and Amyas
thought that he was going to display the strength of his arm and the
temper of his blade in severing the chain at one stroke

Even he was not prepared for the recondite fancies of a Spanish
adventurer worthy son or nephew of those first conquerors who used to
try the keenness of their swords upon the living bodies of Indians and
regale themselves at meals with the odor of roasting caciques

The blade gleamed in the air once twice and fell not on the chain
but on the wrist which it fettered There was a shrieka crimson
flashand the chain and its prisoner were parted indeed

One moment more and Amyass arrow would have been through the throat
of the murderer who paused regarding his workmanship with a satisfied
smile but vengeance was not to come from him

Quick and fierce as a tigercat the girl sprang on the ruffian and
with the intense strength of passion clasped him in her arms and
leaped with him from the narrow ledge into the abyss below

There was a rush a shout all faces were bent over the precipice
The girl hung by her chained wrist the officer was gone There was a
moments awful silence and then Amyas heard his body crashing through
the treetops far below

Haul her up Hew her in pieces Burn the witch and the driver
seizing the chain pulled at it with all his might while all springing
from their chairs stooped over the brink

Now was the time for Amyas Heaven had delivered them into his hands
Swift and sure at ten yards off his arrow rushed through the body of
the driver and then with a roar as of the leaping lion he sprang like
an avenging angel into the midst of the astonished ruffians

His first thought was for the girl In a moment by sheer strength he
had jerked her safely up into the road while the Spaniards recoiled
right and left fancying him for the moment some mountain giant or
supernatural foe His hurrah undeceived them in an instant and a cry
of English Lutheran dogs arose but arose too late The men of Devon
had followed their captains lead a storm of arrows left five Spaniards
dead and a dozen more wounded and down leapt Salvation Yeo his white
hair streaming behind him with twenty good swords more and the work of
death began

The Spaniards fought like lions but they had no time to fix their
arquebuses on the crutches no room in that narrow path to use their
pikes The English had the wall of them and to have the wall there was
to have the foes life at their mercy Five desperate minutes and not a
living Spaniard stood upon those steps and certainly no living one lay
in the green abyss below Two only who were behind the rest happening
to be in full armor escaped without mortal wound and fled down the
hill again

After them Michael Evans and Simon Heard and catch them if they run
a league

The two long and lean Clovelly men active as deer from forest training
ran two feet for the Spaniards one and in ten minutes returned having
done their work while Amyas and his men hurried past the Indians to
help Cary and the party forward where shouts and musket shots announced
a sharp affray

Their arrival settled the matter All the Spaniards fell but three or
four who scrambled down the crannies of the cliff

Let not one of them escape Slay them as Israel slew Amalek cried
Yeo as he bent over and ere the wretches could reach a place of
shelter an arrow was quivering in each body as it rolled lifeless down
the rocks

Now then Loose the Indians

They found armorers tools on one of the dead bodies and it was done

We are your friends said Amyas All we ask is that you shall help
us to carry this gold down to the Magdalena and then you are free

Some few of the younger grovelled at his knees and kissed his feet
hailing him as the child of the Sun but the most part kept a stolid
indifference and when freed from their fetters sat quietly down where
they stood staring into vacancy The iron had entered too deeply into
their soul They seemed past hope enjoyment even understanding

But the young girl who was last of all in the line as soon as she was
loosed sprang to her fathers body speaking no word lifted it in her
thin arms laid it across her knees kissed the fallen lips stroked
the furrowed cheeks murmured inarticulate sounds like the cooing of a
woodland dove of which none knew the meaning but she and he who heard
not for his soul had long since fled Suddenly the truth flashed on
her silent as ever she drew one long heaving breath and rose erect
the body in her arms

Another moment and she had leaped into the abyss

They watched her dark and slender limbs twined closely round the old
mans corpse turn over and over and over till a crash among the
leaves and a scream among the birds told that she had reached the
trees and the green roof hid her from their view

Brave lass shouted a sailor

The Lord forgive her said Yeo But your worship we must have these
rascals ordnance

And their clothes too Yeo if we wish to get down the Magdalena
unchallenged Now listen my masters all We have won by Gods good
grace gold enough to serve us the rest of our lives and that without
losing a single man and may yet win more if we be wise and He thinks
good But oh my friends remember Mr Oxenham and his crew and do
not make Gods gift our ruin by faithlessness or greediness or any
mutinous haste

You shall find none in us cried several men We know your worship
We can trust our general

Thank God said Amyas Now then it will be no shame or sin to
make the Indians carry it saving the women whom God forbid we
should burden But we must pass through the very heart of the Spanish
settlements and by the town of Saint Martha itself So the clothes and
weapons of these Spaniards we must have let it cost us what labor it
may How many lie in the road

Thirteen here and about ten up above said Cary

Then there are near twenty missing Who will volunteer to go down over
cliff and bring up the spoil of them

I and I and I and a dozen stepped out as they did always when
Amyas wanted anything done for the simple reason that they knew that
he meant to help at the doing of it himself

Very well then follow me Sir John take the Indian lad for your
interpreter and try and comfort the souls of these poor heathens Tell
them that they shall all be free

Why who is that comes up the road

All eyes were turned in the direction of which he spoke And wonder of
wonders up came none other than Ayacanora herself blowgun in hand
bow on back and bedecked in all her feather garments which last were
rather the worse for a fortnights woodland travel

All stood mute with astonishment as seeing Amyas she uttered a cry
of joy quickened her pace into a run and at last fell panting and
exhausted at his feet

I have found you she said you ran away from me but you could not
escape me And she fawned round Amyas like a dog who has found his
master and then sat down on the bank and burst into wild sobs

God help us said Amyas clutching his hair as he looked down upon
the beautiful weeper What am I to do with her over and above all
these poor heathens

But there was no time to be lost and over the cliff he scrambled while
the girl seeing that the main body of the English remained sat down on
a point of rock to watch him

After halfanhours hard work the weapons clothes and armor of the
fallen Spaniards were hauled up the cliff and distributed in bundles
among the men the rest of the corpses were thrown over the precipice
and they started again upon their road toward the Magdalena while Yeo
snorted like a warhorse who smells the battle at the delight of once
more handling powder and ball

We can face the world now sir Why not go back and try Santa Fe after
all

But Amyas thought that enough was as good as a feast and they held on
downwards while the slaves followed without a sign of gratitude but
meekly obedient to their new masters and testifying now and then by a
sign or a grunt their surprise at not being beaten or made to carry
their captors Some however caught sight of the little calabashes of
coca which the English carried That woke them from their torpor
and they began coaxing abjectly and not in vain for a taste of that
miraculous herb which would not only make food unnecessary and enable
their panting lungs to endure that keen mountain air but would rid
them for awhile at least of the fallen Indians most unpitying foe
the malady of thought

As the cavalcade turned the corner of the mountain they paused for one
last look at the scene of that fearful triumph Lines of vultures were
already streaming out of infinite space as if created suddenly for the
occasion A few hours and there would be no trace of that fierce fray
but a few white bones amid untrodden beds of flowers

And now Amyas had time to ask Ayacanora the meaning of this her strange
appearance He wished her anywhere but where she was but now that she
was here what heart could be so hard as not to take pity on the poor
wild thing And Amyas as he spoke to her had perhaps a tenderness in
his tone from very fear of hurting her which he had never used before
Passionately she told him how she had followed on their track day and
night and had every evening made sounds as loud as she dared in hopes
of their hearing her and either waiting for her or coming back to see
what caused the noise

Amyas now recollected the strange roaring which had followed them

Noises What did you make them with

Ayacanora lifted her finger with an air of most selfsatisfied mystery
and then drew cautiously from under her feather cloak an object at which
Amyas had hard work to keep his countenance

Look whispered she as if half afraid that the thing itself should
hear her I have itthe holy trumpet

There it was verily that mysterious bone of contention a handsome
earthen tube some two feet long neatly glazed and painted with quaint
grecques and figures of animals a relic evidently of some civilization
now extinct

Brimblecombe rubbed his little fat hands Brave maid you have cheated
Satan this time quoth he while Yeo advised that the idolatrous
relic should be forthwith hove over cliff

Let be said Amyas What is the meaning of this Ayacanora And why
have you followed us

She told a long story from which Amyas picked up as far as he could
understand her that that trumpet had been for years the torment of her
life the one thing in the tribe superior to her the one thing which
she was not allowed to see because forsooth she was a woman So she
determined to show them that a woman was as good as a man and hence
her hatred of marriage and her Amazonian exploits But still the Piache
would not show her that trumpet or tell her where it was and as for
going to seek it even she feared the superstitious wrath of the tribe
at such a profanation But the day after the English went the Piache
chose to express his joy at their departure whereon as was to be
expected a fresh explosion between master and pupil which ended she
confessed in her burning the old rogues hut over his head from which
he escaped with loss of all his conjuringtackle and fled raging into
the woods vowing that he would carry off the trumpet to the neighboring
tribe Whereon by a sudden impulse the young lady took plenty of coca
her weapons and her feathers started on his trail and ran him to
earth just as he was unveiling the precious mystery At which sight
she confessed she was horribly afraid and half inclined to run but
gathering courage from the thought that the white men used to laugh at
the whole matter she rushed upon the hapless conjuror and bore off her
prize in triumph and there it was

I hope you have not killed him said Amyas

I did beat him a little but I thought you would not let me kill him

Amyas was half amused with her confession of his authority over her but
she went on

And then I dare not go back to the Indians so I was forced to come
after you

And is that then your only reason for coming after us asked stupid
Amyas

He had touched some secret chordthough what it was he was too busy to
inquire The girl drew herself up proudly blushing scarlet and said

You never tell lies Do you think that I would tell lies

On which she fell to the rear and followed them steadfastly speaking
to no one but evidently determined to follow them to the worlds end

They soon left the highroad and for several days held on downwards
hewing their path slowly and painfully through the thick underwood On
the evening of the fourth day they had reached the margin of a river
at a point where it seemed broad and still enough for navigation For
those three days they had not seen a trace of human beings and the spot
seemed lonely enough for them to encamp without fear of discovery and
begin the making of their canoes They began to spread themselves along
the stream in search of the softwooded trees proper for their purpose
but hardly had their search begun when in the midst of a dense
thicket they came upon a sight which filled them with astonishment
Beneath a honeycombed cliff which supported one enormous cottontree
was a spot of some thirty yards square sloping down to the stream
planted in rows with magnificent bananaplants full twelve feet high
and bearing among their huge waxy leaves clusters of ripening
fruit while under their mellow shade yams and cassava plants were
flourishing luxuriantly the whole being surrounded by a hedge of orange
and scarlet flowers There it lay streaked with long shadows from the
setting sun while a cool southern air rustled in the cottontree and
flapped to and fro the great bananaleaves a tiny paradise of art and
care But where was its inhabitant

Aroused by the noise of their approach a figure issued from a cave in
the rocks and after gazing at them for a moment came down the garden
towards them He was a tall and stately old man whose snowwhite beard
and hair covered his chest and shoulders while his lower limbs were
wrapt in Indianweb Slowly and solemnly he approached a staff in one
hand a string of beads in the other the living likeness of some old
Hebrew prophet or anchorite of ancient legend He bowed courteously to
Amyas who of course returned his salute and was in act to speak when
his eye fell upon the Indians who were laying down their burdens in
a heap under the trees His mild countenance assumed instantly an
expression of the acutest sorrow and displeasure and striking his
hands together he spoke in Spanish

Alas miserable me Alas unhappy senors Do my old eyes deceive me
and is it one of those evil visions of the past which haunt my dreams
by night or has the accursed thirst of gold the ruin of my race
penetrated even into this my solitude Oh senors senors know you not
that you bear with you your own poison your own familiar fiend the
root of every evil And is it not enough for you senors to load
yourselves with the wedge of Achan and partake his doom but you must
make these hapless heathens the victims of your greed and cruelty
and forestall for them on earth those torments which may await their
unbaptized souls hereafter

We have preserved and not enslaved these Indians ancient senor said
Amyas proudly and tomorrow will see them as free as the birds over
our heads

Free Then you cannot be countrymen of mine But pardon an old man
my son if he has spoken too hastily in the bitterness of his own
experience But who and whence are you And why are you bringing into
this lonely wilderness that goldfor I know too well the shape of those
accursed packets which would God that I had never seen

What we are reverend sir matters little as long as we behave to you
as the young should to the old As for our gold it will be a curse or
a blessing to us I conceive just as we use it well or ill and so is
a mans head or his hand or any other thing but that is no reason for
cutting off his limbs for fear of doing harm with them neither is it
for throwing away those packages which by your leave we shall deposit
in one of these caves We must be your neighbors I fear for a day
or two but I can promise you that your garden shall be respected on
condition that you do not inform any human soul of our being here

God forbid senor that I should try to increase the number of my
visitors much less to bring hither strife and blood of which I have
seen too much already As you have come in peace in peace depart Leave
me alone with God and my penitence and may the Lord have mercy on you

And he was about to withdraw when recollecting himself he turned
suddenly to Amyas again

Pardon me senor if after forty years of utter solitude I shrink at
first from the conversation of human beings and forget in the habitual
shyness of a recluse the duties of a hospitable gentleman of Spain
My garden and all which it produces is at your service Only let me
entreat that these poor Indians shall have their share for heathens
though they be Christ died for them and I cannot but cherish in my
soul some secret hope that He did not die in vain

God forbid said Brimblecombe They are no worse than we for aught
I see whatsoever their fathers may have been and they have fared no
worse than we since they have been with us nor will I promise you

The good fellow did not tell that he had been starving himself for the
last three days to cram the children with his own rations and that
the sailors and even Amyas had been going out of their way every five
minutes to get fruit for their new pets

A camp was soon formed and that evening the old hermit asked Amyas
Cary and Brimblecombe to come up into his cavern

They went and after the accustomed compliments had passed sat down on
mats upon the ground while the old man stood leaning against a slab of
stone surmounted by a rude wooden cross which evidently served him as
a place of prayer He seemed restless and anxious as if he waited for
them to begin the conversation while they in their turn waited for
him At last when courtesy would not allow him to be silent any longer
he began with a faltering voice

You may be equally surprised senors at my presence in such a spot
and at my asking you to become my guests even for one evening while I
have no better hospitality to offer you

It is superfluous senor to offer us food in your own habitation when
you have already put all that you possess at our command

True senors and my motive for inviting you was perhaps somewhat of
a selfish one I am possessed by a longing to unburthen my heart of a
tale which I never yet told to man and which I fear can give to you
nothing but pain and yet I will entreat you of your courtesy to hear
of that which you cannot amend simply in mercy to a man who feels that
he must confess to some one or die as miserable as he has lived And
I believe my confidence will not be misplaced when it is bestowed upon
you I have been a cavalier even as you are and strange as it may
seem that which I have to tell I would sooner impart to the ears of a
soldier than of a priest because it will then sink into souls which can
at least sympathize though they cannot absolve And you cavaliers I
perceive to be noble from your very looks to be valiant by your mere
presence in this hostile land and to be gentle courteous and prudent
by your conduct this day to me and to your captives Will you then
hear an old mans tale I am as you see full of words for speech
from long disuse is difficult to me and I fear at every sentence lest
my stiffened tongue should play the traitor to my wornout brain but
if my request seems impertinent you have only to bid me talk as a host
should of matters which concern his guests and not himself

The three young men equally surprised and interested by this exordium
could only entreat their host to use their ears as those of his
slaves on which after fresh apologies he began

Know then victorious cavaliers that I whom you now see here as a
poor hermit was formerly one of the foremost of that terrible band who
went with Pizarro to the conquest of Peru Eighty years old am I this
day unless the calendar which I have carved upon yonder tree deceives
me and twenty years old was I when I sailed with that fierce man from
Panama to do that deed with which all earth and heaven and hell
itself I fear has rung How we endured suffered and triumphed how
mad with success and glutted with blood we turned our swords against
each other I need not tell to you For what gentleman of Europe knows
not our glory and our shame

His hearers bowed assent

Yes you have heard of our prowess for glorious we were awhile in
the sight of God and man But I will not speak of our glory for it is
tarnished nor of our wealth for it was our poison nor of the sins of
my comrades for they have expiated them but of my own sins senors
which are more in number than the hairs of my head and a burden too
great to bear Miserere Domine

And smiting on his breast the old warrior went on

As I said we were mad with blood and none more mad than I Surely it
is no fable that men are possessed even in this latter age by devils
Why else did I rejoice in slaying Why else was I the son of a noble
and truthful cavalier of Castile among the foremost to urge upon
my general the murder of the Inca Why did I rejoice over his dying
agonies Why when Don Ferdinando de Soto returned and upbraided us
with our villainy did I instead of confessing the sin which that noble
cavalier set before us withstand him to his face ay and would have
drawn the sword on him but that he refused to fight a liar as he said
that I was

Then Don de Soto was against the murder So his own grandson told me
But I had heard of him only as a tyrant and a butcher

Senor he was compact of good and evil as are other men he has paid
dearly for his sin let us hope that he has been paid in turn for his
righteousness

John Brimblecombe shook his head at this doctrine but did not speak

So you know his grandson I trust he is a noble cavalier

Amyas was silent the old gentleman saw that he had touched some sore
point and continued

And why again senors did I after that day give myself up to cruelty
as to a sport yea thought that I did God service by destroying the
creatures whom He had made I who now dare not destroy a gnat lest I
harm a being more righteous than myself Was I mad If I was how then
was I all that while as prudent as I am this day But I am not here to
argue senors but to confess In a word there was no deed of blood
done for the next few years in which I had not my share if it were but
within my reach When Challcuchima was burned I was consenting when
that fair girl the wife of Inca Manco was tortured to death I smiled
at the agonies at which she too smiled and taunted on the soldiers to
try if I could wring one groan from her before she died You know what
followed the pillage the violence the indignities offered to the
virgins of the Sun Senors I will not pollute your chaste ears with
what was done But senors I had a brother

And the old man paused awhile

A brotherwhether better or worse than me God knows before whom he
has appeared ere now At least he did not as I did end as a rebel
to his king There was a maiden in one of those convents senors more
beautiful than day and I blush to tell it the two brothers of whom
I spoke quarrelled for the possession of her They struck each other
senors Who struck first I know not but swords were drawn andThe
cavaliers round parted them crying shame And one of those two
brothersthe one who speaks to you nowcrying If I cannot have her
no man shall turned the sword which was aimed at his brother against
that hapless maidenandhear me out senors before you flee from my
presence as from that of a monsterstabbed her to the heart And as
she diedone moment more senors that I may confess allshe looked
up in my face with a smile as of heaven and thanked me for having rid
her once and for all from Christians and their villainy

The old man paused

God forgive you senor said Jack Brimblecombe softly

You do not then turn from me do not curse me Then I will try you
farther still senors I will know from human lips whether man can do
such deeds as I have done and yet be pitied by his kind that so I may
have some hope that where man has mercy God may have mercy also Do
you think that I repented at those awful words Nothing less senors
all No more than I did when De Soto on whose soul God have mercy
called meme a liar I knew myself a sinner and for that very reason
I was determined to sin I would go on that I might prove myself right
to myself by showing that I could go on and not be struck dead from
heaven Out of mere pride senors and selfwill I would fill up the
cup of my iniquity and I filled it

You know doubtless senors how after the death of old Almagro his
sons party conspired against Pizarro Now my brother remained faithful
to his old commander and for that very reason if you will believe it
did I join the opposite party and gave myself up body and soul to do
Almagros work It was enough for me that the brother who had struck
me thought a man right for me to think that man a devil What Almagros
work was you know He slew Pizarro murdered him senors like a dog
or rather like an old lion

He deserved his doom said Amyas

Let God judge him senor not we and least of all of us I who drew
the first blood and perhaps the last that day I senors it was
who treacherously stabbed Francisco de Chanes on the staircase and so
opened the door which else had foiled us all and IBut I am speaking
to men of honor not to butchers Suffice it that the old man died like
a lion and that we pulled him down young as we were like curs

Well I followed Almagros fortunes I helped to slay Alvarado Call
that my third murder if you will for if he was traitor to a traitor I
was traitor to a true man Then to the war you know how Vaca de Castro
was sent from Spain to bring order and justice where was naught but
chaos and the dance of all devils We met him on the hills of Chupas
Peter of Candia the Venetian villain pointed our guns false and
Almagro stabbed him to the heart We charged with our lances man
against man horse against horse All fights I ever fought and the old
mans eyes flashed out the ancient fire were childs play to that day
Our lances shivered like reeds and we fell on with battleaxe and mace
None asked for quarter and none gave it friend to friend cousin to
cousinno nor brother O God to brother We were the better armed
but numbers were on their side Fat Carbajal charged our cannon like an
elephant and took them but Holguin was shot down I was with Almagro
and we swept all before us inch by inch but surely till the night
fell Then Vaca de Castro the licentiate the clerk the schoolman
the man of books came down on us with his reserve like a whirlwind
Oh cavaliers did not God fight against us when He let us the men of
iron us the heroes of Cuzco and Vilcaconga be foiled by a scholar in
a black gown with a pen behind his ear We were beaten Some ran some
did not run senors and I did not Geronimo de Alvarado shouted to
me We slew Pizarro We killed the tyrant and we rushed upon the
conquerors lances to die like cavaliers There was a gallant gentleman
in front of me His lance struck me in the crest and bore me over my
horses croup but mine senors struck him full in the vizor We both
went to the ground together and the battle galloped over us

I know not how long I lay for I was stunned but after awhile I lifted
myself My lance was still clenched in my hand broken but not parted
The point of it was in my foemans brain I crawled to him weary and
wounded and saw that he was a noble cavalier He lay on his back his
arms spread wide I knew that he was dead but there came over me the
strangest longing to see that dead mans face Perhaps I knew him At
least I could set my foot upon it and say Vanquished as I am there
lies a foe I caught hold of the rivets and tore his helmet off The
moon shone bright senors as bright as she shines nowthe glaring
ghastly telltale moon which shows man all the sins which he tries to
hide and by that moonlight senors I beheld the dead mans face And
it was the face of my brother

     

Did you ever guess most noble cavaliers what Cains curse might be
like Look on me and know

I tore off my armor and fled as Cain flednorthward ever till I
should reach a land where the name of Spaniard yea and the name of
Christian which the Spaniard has caused to be blasphemed from east to
west should never come I sank fainting and waked beneath this rock
this tree fortyfour years ago and I have never left them since save
once to obtain seeds from Indians who knew not that I was a Spanish
Conquistador And may God have mercy on my soul

The old man ceased and his young hearers deeply affected by his tale
sat silent for a few minutes Then John Brimblecombe spoke

You are old sir and I am young and perhaps it is not my place to
counsel you Moreover sir in spite of this strange dress of mine I am
neither more nor less than an English priest and I suppose you will not
be willing to listen to a heretic

I have seen Catholics senor commit too many abominations even with
the name of God upon their lips to shrink from a heretic if he speak
wisely and well At least you are a man and after all my heart yearns
more and more the longer I sit among you for the speech of beings of
my own race Say what you will in Gods name

I hold sir said Jack modestly according to holy Scripture that
whosoever repents from his heart as God knows you seem to have done is
forgiven there and then and though his sins be as scarlet they shall
be white as snow for the sake of Him who died for all

Amen Amen said the old man looking lovingly at his little crucifix
I hope and prayHis name is Love I know it now who better But sir
even if He have forgiven me how can I forgive myself In honor sir I
must be just and sternly just to myself even if God be indulgent
as He has been to me who has left me here in peace for forty years
instead of giving me a prey to the first puma or jaguar which howls
round me every night He has given me time to work out my own salvation
but have I done it That doubt maddens me at whiles When I look upon
that crucifix I float on boundless hope but if I take my eyes from
it for a moment faith fails and all is blank and dark and dreadful
till the devil whispers me to plunge into yon stream and once and for
ever wake to certainty even though it be in hell

What was Jack to answer He himself knew not at first More was wanted
than the mere repetition of free pardon

Heretic as I am sir you will not believe me when I tell you as a
priest that God accepts your penitence

My heart tells me so already at moments But how know I that it does
not lie

Senor said Jack the best way to punish oneself for doing ill seems
to me to go and do good and the best way to find out whether God means
you well is to find out whether He will help you to do well If you
have wronged Indians in time past see whether you cannot right them
now If you can you are safe For the Lord will not send the devils
servants to do His work

The old man held down his head

Right the Indians Alas what is done is done

Not altogether senor said Amyas as long as an Indian remains alive
in New Granada

Senor shall I confess my weakness A voice within me has bid me a
hundred times go forth and labor for those oppressed wretches but I
dare not obey I dare not look them in the face I should fancy that
they knew my story that the very birds upon the trees would reveal my
crime and bid them turn from me with horror

Senor said Amyas these are but the sick fancies of a noble spirit
feeding on itself in solitude You have but to try to conquer

And look now said Jack if you dare not go forth to help the
Indians see now how God has brought the Indians to your own door Oh
excellent sir

Call me not excellent said the old man smiting his breast

I do and shall sir while I see in you an excellent repentance an
excellent humility and an excellent justice said Jack But oh sir
look upon these forty souls whom we must leave behind like sheep which
have no shepherd Could you not teach them to fear God and to love each
other to live like rational men perhaps to die like Christians They
would obey you as a dog obeys his master You might be their king their
father yea their pope if you would

You do not speak like a Lutheran

I am not a Lutheran but an Englishman but Protestant as I am God
knows I had sooner see these poor souls of your creed than of none

But I am no priest

When they are ready said Jack the Lord will send a priest If you
begin the good work you may trust to Him to finish it

God help me said the old warrior

The talk lasted long into the night but Amyas was up long before
daybreak felling the trees and as he and Cary walked back to
breakfast the first thing which they saw was the old man in his garden
with four or five Indian children round him talking smilingly to them

The old mans heart is sound still said Will No man is lost who
still is fond of little children

Ah senors said the hermit as they came up you see that I have
begun already to act upon your advice

And you have begun at the right end quoth Amyas if you win the
children you win the mothers

And if you win the mothers quoth Will the poor fathers must needs
obey their wives and follow in the wake

The old man only sighed The prattle of these little ones softens
my hard heart senors with a new pleasure but it saddens me when I
recollect that there may be children of mine now in the worldchildren
who have never known a fathers lovenever known aught but a masters
threats

God has taken care of these little ones Trust that He has taken care
of yours

That day Amyas assembled the Indians and told them that they must obey
the hermit as their king and settle there as best they could for if
they broke up and wandered away nothing was left for them but to fall
one by one into the hands of the Spaniards They heard him with their
usual melancholy and stupid acquiescence and went and came as they were
bid like animated machines but the negroes were of a different temper
and four or five stout fellows gave Amyas to understand that they had
been warriors in their own country and that warriors they would be
still and nothing should keep them from Spaniardhunting Amyas saw
that the presence of these desperadoes in the new colony would both
endanger the authority of the hermit and bring the Spaniards down
upon it in a few weeks so making a virtue of necessity he asked them
whether they would go Spaniardhunting with him

This was just what the bold Coromantees wished for they grinned and
shouted their delight at serving under so great a warrior and then set
to work most gallantly getting through more in the day than any ten
Indians and indeed than any two Englishmen

So went on several days during which the trees were felled and the
process of digging them out began while Ayacanora silent and moody
wandered into the woods all day with her blowgun and brought home
at evening a load of parrots monkeys and curassows two or three old
hands were sent out to hunt likewise so that what with the game and
the fish of the river which seemed inexhaustible and the fruit of the
neighboring palmtrees there was no lack of food in the camp But what
to do with Ayacanora weighed heavily on the mind of Amyas He opened his
heart on the matter to the old hermit and asked him whether he would
take charge of her The latter smiled and shook his head at the notion
If your report of her be true I may as well take in hand to tame a
jaguar However he promised to try and one evening as they were
all standing together before the mouth of the cave Ayacanora came up
smiling with the fruit of her days sport and Amyas thinking this a
fit opportunity began a carefully prepared harangue to her which he
intended to be altogether soothing and even patheticto the effect
that the maiden having no parents was to look upon this good old man
as her father that he would instruct her in the white mans religion
at which promise Yeo as a good Protestant winced a good deal and
teach her how to be happy and good and so forth and that in fine she
was to remain there with the hermit

She heard him quietly her great dark eyes opening wider and wider her
bosom swelling her stature seeming to grow taller every moment as she
clenched her weapons firmly in both her hands Beautiful as she always
was she had never looked so beautiful before and as Amyas spoke of
parting with her it was like throwing away a lovely toy but it must be
done for her sake for his perhaps for that of all the crew

The last words had hardly passed his lips when with a shriek of
mingled scorn rage and fear she dashed through the astonished group

Stop her were Amyass first words but his next were Let her
go for springing like a deer through the little garden and over the
flowerfence she turned menacing with her blowgun the sailors who
had already started in her pursuit

Let her alone for Heavens sake shouted Amyas who he scarce knew
why shrank from the thought of seeing those graceful limbs struggling
in the seamens grasp

She turned again and in another minute her gaudy plumes had vanished
among the dark forest stems as swiftly as if she had been a passing
bird

All stood thunderstruck at this unexpected end to the conference At
last Aymas spoke

Theres no use in standing here idle gentlemen Staring after her
wont bring her back After all Im glad shes gone

But the tone of his voice belied his words Now he had lost her he
wanted her back and perhaps every one present except he guessed why

But Ayacanora did not return and ten days more went on in continual
toil at the canoes without any news of her from the hunters Amyas by
the by had strictly bidden these last not to follow the girl not even
to speak to her if they came across her in their wanderings He was
shrewd enough to guess that the only way to cure her sulkiness was to
outsulk her but there was no sign of her presence in any direction and
the canoes being finished at last the gold and such provisions as they
could collect were placed on board and one evening the party prepared
for their fresh voyage They determined to travel as much as possible by
night for fear of discovery especially in the neighborhood of the few
Spanish settlements which were then scattered along the banks of the
main stream These however the negroes knew so that there was no fear
of coming on them unawares and as for falling asleep in their night
journeys Nobody the negroes said ever slept on the Magdalena the
mosquitoes took too good care of that Which fact Amyas and his crew
verified afterwards as thoroughly as wretched men could do

The sun had sunk the night had all but fallen the men were all on
board Amyas in command of one canoe Cary of the other The Indians
were grouped on the bank watching the party with their listless
stare and with them the young guide who preferred remaining among the
Indians and was made supremely happy by the present of Spanish sword
and an English axe while in the midst the old hermit with tears in
his eyes prayed Gods blessing on them

I owe to you noble cavaliers new peace new labor I may say new
life May God be with you and teach you to use your gold and your
swords better than I used mine

The adventurers waved their hands to him

Give way men cried Amyas and as he spoke the paddles dashed into
the water to a right English hurrah which sent the birds fluttering
from their roosts and was answered by the yell of a hundred monkeys
and the distant roar of the jaguar

About twenty yards below a wooded rock some ten feet high hung over
the stream The river was not there more than fifteen yards broad deep
near the rock shallow on the farther side and Amyass canoe led the
way within ten feet of the stone

As he passed a dark figure leapt from the bushes on the edge and
plunged heavily into the water close to the boat All started A jaguar
No he would not have missed so short a spring What then A human
being

A head rose panting to the surface and with a few strong strokes the
swimmer had clutched the gunwale It was Ayacanora

Go back shouted Amyas Go back girl

She uttered the same wild cry with which she had fled into the forest

I will die then and she threw up her arms Another moment and she
had sunk

To see her perish before his eyes who could bear that Her hands
alone were above the surface Amyas caught convulsively at her in the
darkness and seized her wrist

A yell rose from the negroes a roar from the crew as from a cage of
lions There was a rush and a swirl along the surface of the stream and
Caiman caiman shouted twenty voices

Now or never for the strong arm To larboard men or over we go
cried Amyas and with one huge heave he lifted the slender body upon
the gunwale Her lower limbs were still in the water when within arms
length rose above the stream a huge muzzle The lower jaw lay flat the
upper reached as high as Amyass head He could see the long fangs
gleam white in the moonshine he could see for one moment full down the
monstrous depths of that great gape which would have crushed a buffalo
Three inches and no more from that soft side the snout surged up

There was the gleam of an axe from above a sharp ringing blow and the
jaws came together with a clash which rang from bank to bank He had
missed her Swerving beneath the blow his snout had passed beneath
her body and smashed up against the side of the canoe as the striker
overbalanced fell headlong overboard upon the monsters back

Who is it

Yeo shouted a dozen

Man and beast went down together and where they sank the moonlight
shone on a great swirling eddy while all held their breaths and
Ayacanora cowered down into the bottom of the canoe her proud spirit
utterly broken for the first time by the terror of that great need
and by a bitter loss For in the struggle the holy trumpet companion
of all her wanderings had fallen from her bosom and her fond hope of
bringing magic prosperity to her English friends had sunk with it to the
bottom of the stream

None heeded her not even Amyas round whose knees she clung fawning
like a spaniel dog for where was Yeo

Another swirl a shout from the canoe abreast of them and Yeo rose
having dived clean under his own boat and risen between the two

Safe as yet lads Heave me a line or hell have me after all

But ere the brute reappeared the old man was safe on board

The Lord has stood by me panted he as he shot the water from
his ears We went down together I knew the Indian trick and being
uppermost had my thumbs in his eyes before he could turn but he
carried me down to the very mud My breath was nigh gone so I left go
and struck up but my toes tingled as I rose again Ill warrant There
the beggar is looking for me I declare

And true enough there was the huge brute swimming slowly round and
round in search of his lost victim It was too dark to put an arrow
into his eye so they paddled on while Ayacanora crouched silently at
Amyass feet

Yeo asked he in a low voice what shall we do with her

Why ask me sir said the old man as he had a very good right to ask

Because when one dont know oneself one had best inquire of ones
elders Besides you saved her life at the risk of your own and have a
right to a voice in the matter if any one has old friend

Then my dear young captain if the Lord puts a precious soul under
your care dont you refuse to bear the burden He lays on you

Amyas was silent awhile while Ayacanora who was evidently utterly
exhausted by the nights adventure and probably by long wanderings
watchings and weepings which had gone before it sank with her head
against his knee fell fast asleep and breathed as gently as a child

At last he rose in the canoe and called Cary alongside

Listen to me gentlemen and sailors all You know that we have a
maiden on board here by no choice of our own Whether she will be a
blessing to us God alone can tell but she may turn to the greatest
curse which has befallen us ever since we came out over Bar three years
ago Promise me one thing or I put her ashore the next beach and that
is that you will treat her as if she were your own sister and make an
agreement here and now that if the maid comes to harm among us the man
that is guilty shall hang for it by the neck till hes dead even though
he be I Captain Leigh who speak to you Ill hang you as I am a
Christian and I give you free leave to hang me

A very fair bargain quoth Cary and I for one will see it kept to
Lads well twine a double strong halter for the captain as we go down
along

I am not jesting Will

I know it good old lad said Cary stretching out his own hand to him
across the water through the darkness and giving him a hearty shake I
know it and listen men So help me God but Ill be the first to back
the Captain in being as good as his word as I trust he never will need
to be

Amen said Brimblecombe Amen said Yeo and many an honest voice
joined in that honest compact and kept it too like men



CHAPTER XXVI

HOW THEY TOOK THE GREAT GALLEON

 When captains courageous whom death could not daunt
 Did march to the siege of the city of Gaunt
 They musterd their soldiers by two and by three
 But the foremost in battle was Mary Ambree
 When brave Sir John Major was slain in her sight
 Who was her true lover her joy and delight
 Because he was murtherd most treacherouslie
 Then vowd to avenge him fair Mary Ambree

 Old Ballad A D 1584

One more glance at the golden tropic sea and the golden tropic
evenings by the shore of New Granada in the golden Spanish Main

The bay of Santa Marta is rippling before the landbreeze one sheet of
living flame The mighty forests are sparkling with myriad fireflies
The lazy mist which lounges round the inner hills shines golden in
the sunset rays and nineteen thousand feet aloft the mighty peak of
Horqueta cleaves the abyss of air rosered against the darkblue
vault of heaven The rosy cone fades to a dull leaden hue but only for
awhile The stars flash out one by one and Venus like another moon
tinges the eastern snows with gold and sheds across the bay a long
yellow line of rippling light Everywhere is glory and richness What
wonder if the earth in that enchanted land be as rich to her inmost
depths as she is upon the surface The heaven the hills the sea are
one sparkling garland of jewelswhat wonder if the soil be jewelled
also if every watercourse and bank of earth be spangled with emeralds
and rubies with grains of gold and feathered wreaths of native silver

So thought in a poetic mood the Bishop of Cartagena as he sat in
the state cabin of that great galleon The City of the True Cross and
looked pensively out of the window towards the shore The good man was
in a state of holy calm His stout figure rested on one easychair his
stout ankles on another beside a table spread with oranges and limes
guavas and pineapples and all the fruits of Ind

An Indian girl bedizened with scarfs and gold chains kept off the
flies with a fan of feathers and by him in a pail of ice from the
Horqueta the gift of some pious Spanish lady who had spent an Indian
or two in bringing down the precious offering stood more than one
flask of virtuous wine of Alicant But he was not so selfish good man
as to enjoy either ice or wine alone Don Pedro colonel of the soldiers
on board Don Alverez intendant of his Catholic majestys customs at
Santa Marta and Don Paul captain of mariners in The City of the
True Cross had by his especial request come to his assistance that
evening and with two friars who sat at the lower end of the table
were doing their best to prevent the good man from taking too bitterly
to heart the present unsatisfactory state of his cathedral town which
had just been sacked and burnt by an old friend of ours Sir Francis
Drake

We have been great sufferers senorsah great sufferers snuffled
the bishop quoting Scripture after the fashion of the day glibly
enough but often much too irreverently for me to repeat so boldly were
his texts travestied and so freely interlarded by grumblings at Tita
and the mosquitoes Great sufferers truly but there shall be a
remnantah a remnant like the shaking of the olive tree and the
gleaning grapes when the vintage is doneAh Gold Yes I trust
Our Ladys mercies are not shut up nor her arms shortenedLook
senorsand he pointed majestically out of the window It looks gold
it smells of gold as I may say by a poetical license Yea the very
waves as they ripple past us sing of gold gold gold

It is a great privilege said the intendant to have comfort so
gracefully administered at once by a churchman and a scholar

A poet too said Don Pedro You have no notion what sweet sonnets

Hush Don Pedrohush If I a mateless bird have spent an idle hour
in teaching lovers how to sing why what of that I am a churchman
senors but I am a man and I can feel senors I can sympathize I can
palliate I can excuse Who knows better than I how much human nature
lurks in us fallen sons of Adam Tita

Um said the trembling girl with a true Indian grunt

Fill his excellency the intendants glass Does much more treasure come
down illustrious senor May the poor of Mary hope for a few more crumbs
from their Mistresss table

Not a pezo I fear The big white cow up thereand he pointed to the
Horquetahas been milked dry for this year

Ah And he looked up at the magnificent snow peak Only good to cool
wine with eh and as safe for the time being as Solomons birds

Solomons birds Explain your recondite allusion my lord

Enlighten us your excellency enlighten us

Ah thereby hangs a tale You know the holy birds who run up and down
on the Prado at Seville among the ladies pretty feeteh with hooked
noses and cinnamon crests Of course HoopoesUpupa as the classics
have it Well senors once on a time the story goes these hoopoes
all had golden crowns on their heads and senors they took the
consequenceseh But it befell on a day that all the birds and beasts
came to do homage at the court of his most Catholic majesty King
Solomon and among them came these same hoopoes and they had a little
request to make the poor rogues And what do you think it was Why
that King Solomon would pray for them that they might wear any sort of
crowns but these same golden ones forlisten Tita and see the snare
of richesmankind so hunted and shot and trapped and snared them
for the sake of these same golden crowns that life was a burden to
bear So Solomon prayed and instead of golden crowns they all received
crowns of feathers and ever since senors they live as merrily as
crickets in an oven and also have the honor of bearing the name of his
most Catholic majesty King Solomon Tita fill the senor commandants
glass Fray Gerundio what are you whispering about down there sir

Fray Gerundio had merely commented to his brother on the bishops story
of Solomons birds with an

O si sic omniawould that all gold would turn to feathers in like
wise

Then friend replied the other a Dominican like Gerundio but of a
darker and sterner complexion corrupt human nature would within a week
discover some fresh bauble for which to kill and be killed in vain

What is that Fray Gerundio asked the bishop again

I merely remarked that it were well for the world if all mankind were
to put up the same prayer as the hoopoes

World sir What do you know about the world Convert your Indians
sir if you please and leave affairs of state to your superiors You
will excuse him senors turning to the Dons and speaking in a lower
tone A very worthy and pious man but a poor peasants son and
besideyou understand A little wrong here too much fasting and
watching I fear good man And the bishop touched his forehead
knowingly to signify that Fray Gerundios wits were in an
unsatisfactory state

The Fray heard and saw with a quiet smile He was one of those excellent
men whom the cruelties of his countrymen had stirred up as the
darkness by mere contrast makes the light more bright as they did
Las Casas Gasca and many another noble name which is written in the
book of life to deeds of love and pious daring worthy of any creed or
age True Protestants they protested even before kings against the
evil which lay nearest them the sin which really beset them true
liberals they did not disdain to call the darkskinned heathen their
brothers and asserted in terms which astonish us when we recollect the
age in which they were spoken the inherent freedom of every being who
wore the flesh and blood which their Lord wore true martyrs they
bore witness of Christ and received too often the rewards of such
in slander and contempt Such an one was Fray Gerundio a poor mean
clumsytongued peasants son who never could put three sentences
together save when he waxed eloquent crucifix in hand amid some
group of Indians or negroes He was accustomed to such rebuffs as the
bishops he took them for what they were worth and sipped his wine in
silence while the talk went on

They say observed the commandant that a very small Platefleet will
go to Spain this year

What else says the intendant What have we to send in the name of
all saints since these accursed English Lutherans have swept us out
clean

And if we had anything to send says the seacaptain what have we to
send it in That fiend incarnate Drake

Ah said his holiness spare my ears Don Pedro you will oblige my
weakness by not mentioning that manhis name is Tartarean unfit
for polite lips Dracoa dragonserpentthe emblem of Diabolus
himselfah And the guardian of the golden apples of the West who
would fain devour our new Hercules his most Catholic majesty Deceived
Eve too with one of those same applesa very evil name senorsa
Tartarean nameTita

Um

Fill my glass

Nay cried the colonel with a great oath this English fellow is of
another breed of serpent from that I warrant

Your reason senor your reason

Because this one would have seen Eve at the bottom of the sea before
he let her or any one but himself taste aught which looked like gold

Ah ahvery good Butwe laugh valiant senors while the Church
weeps Alas for my sheep

And alas for their sheepfold It will be four years before we can get
Cartagena rebuilt again And as for the blockhouse when we shall get
that rebuilt Heaven only knows while his majesty goes on draining the
Indies for his English Armada The town is as naked now as an Indians
back

Baptista Antonio the surveyor has sent home by me a relation to the
king setting forth our defenceless state But to read a relation and
to act on it are two cocks of very different hackles bishop as all
statesmen know Heaven grant we may have orders by the next fleet to
fortify or we shall be at the mercy of every English pirate

Ah that blockhouse sighed the bishop That was indeed a villainous
trick A hundred and ten thousand ducats for the ransom of the town
After having burned and plundered the onehalfand having made me
dine with them too ah and sit between thethe serpent and his
lieutenantgeneraland drunk my health in my own private winewine
that I had from Xeres nine years ago senors and offered the shameless
heretics to take me to England if I would turn Lutheran and find me a
wife and make an honest man of meah and then to demand fresh ransom
for the priory and the fortperfidious

Well said the colonel they had the law of us the cunning rascals
for we forgot to mention anything but the town in the agreement Who
would have dreamed of such a fetch as that

So I told my good friend the prior when he came to me to borrow the
thousand crowns It was Heavens will Unexpected like the thunderbolt
and to be borne as such Every man must bear his own burden How could I
lend him aught

Your holinesss money had been all carried off by them before said
the intendant who knew and none better the exact contrary

Just soall my scanty savings desolate in my lone old age Ah
senors had we not had warning of the coming of these wretches from
my dear friend the Marquess of Santa Cruz whom I remember daily in my
prayers we had been like to them who go down quick into the pit I too
might have saved a trifle had I been minded but in thinking too much
of others I forgot myself alas

Warning or none we had no right to be beaten by such a handful said
the seacaptain and a shame it is and a shame it will be for many a
day to come

Do you mean to cast any slur sir upon the courage and conduct of his
Catholic majestys soldiers asked the colonel

INo but we were foully beaten and that behind our barricades too
and theres the plain truth

Beaten sir Do you apply such a term to the fortunes of war What more
could our governor have done Had we not the ways filled with poisoned
caltrops guarded by Indian archers barred with butts full of earth
raked with culverins and arquebuses What familiar spirit had we sir
to tell us that these villains would come along the seabeach and not
by the highroad like Christian men

Ah said the bishop it was by intuition diabolic I doubt not that
they took that way Satanas must need help those who serve him and for
my part I can only attribute I would the captain here had piety enough
to do so the misfortune which occurred to artmagic I believe these
men to have been possessed by all fiends whatsoever

Well your holiness said the colonel there may have been devilry
in it how else would men have dared to run right into the mouths of our
cannon fire their shot against our very noses and tumble harmless over
those huge butts of earth

Doubtless by force of the fiends which raged with them interposed the
bishop

And then with their blasphemous cries leap upon us with sword and
pike I myself saw that LieutenantGeneral Carlisle hew down with one
stroke that noble young gentleman the ensignbearer your excellencys
sisters sons nephew though he was armed capapie Was not artmagic
here And that most furious and blaspheming Lutheran Captain Young I
saw how he caught our general by the head after the illustrious Don
Alonzo had given him a grievous wound threw him to the earth and so
took him Was not artmagic here

Well I say said the captain if you are looking for artmagic what
say you to their marching through the flank fire of our galleys with
eleven pieces of ordnance and two hundred shot playing on them as if
it had been a mosquito swarm Some said my men fired too high but that
was the English rascals doing for they got down on the tide beach
But senor commandant though Satan may have taught them that trick was
it he that taught them to carry pikes a foot longer than yours

Ah well said the bishop sacked are we and San Domingo as I hear
in worse case than we are and St Augustine in Florida likewise and
all that is left for a poor priest like me is to return to Spain and
see whether the pious clemency of his majesty and of the universal
Father may not be willing to grant some small relief or bounty to the
poor of Maryperhapsfor who knows to translate to a sphere of
more peaceful labor one who is now old senors and weary with many
toilsTita fill our glasses I have saved somewhatas you may have
done senors from the general wreck and for the flock when I am no
more illustrious senors Heavens mercies are infinite new cities will
rise from the ashes of the old new mines pour forth their treasures
into the sanctified laps of the faithful and new Indians flock toward
the lifegiving standard of the Cross to put on the easy yoke and light
burden of the Church and

And where shall I be then Ah where Fain would I rest and fain
depart Tita sling my hammock Senors you will excuse age and
infirmities Fray Gerundio go to bed

And the Dons rose to depart while the bishop went on maundering

Farewell Life is short Ah we shall meet in heaven at last And there
are really no more pearls

Not a frail nor gold either said the intendant

Ah well Better a dinner of herbs where love is thanTita

My breviaryah Mans gratitude is shortlived I had hopedYou have
seen nothing of the Senora Bovadilla

No

Ah she promisedbut no mattera little trifle as a keepsakea gold
cross or an emerald ring or what notI forget And what have I to do
with worldly wealthAh Tita bring me the casket

And when his guests were gone the old man began mumbling prayers out of
his breviary and fingering over jewels and gold with the dull greedy
eyes of covetous old age

Ahit may buy the red hat yetOmnia Romae venalia Put it by Tita
and do not look at it too much child Enter not into temptation The
love of money is the root of all evil and Heaven in love for the
Indian has made him poor in this world that he may be rich in faith
AhUghSo

And the old miser clambered into his hammock Tita drew the mosquito
net over him wrapt another round her own head and slept or seemed to
sleep for she coiled herself up upon the floor and master and slave
soon snored a merry bass to the treble of the mosquitoes

It was long past midnight and the moon was down The sentinels who had
tramped and challenged overhead till they thought their officers were
sound asleep had slipped out of the unwholesome rays of the planet to
seek that health and peace which they considered their right and slept
as soundly as the bishops self

Two long lines glided out from behind the isolated rocks of the Morro
Grande which bounded the bay some five hundred yards astern of the
galleon They were almost invisible on the glittering surface of the
water being perfectly white and had a sentinel been looking out he
could only have descried them by the phosphorescent flashes along their
sides

Now the bishop had awoke and turned himself over uneasily for the wine
was dying out within him and his shoulders had slipped down and his
heels up and his head ached so he sat upright in his hammock looked
out upon the bay and called Tita

Put another pillow under my head child What is that a fish

Tita looked She did not think it was a fish but she did not choose to
say so for it might have produced an argument and she had her reasons
for not keeping his holiness awake

The bishop looked again settled that it must be a white whale or
shark or other monster of the deep crossed himself prayed for a safe
voyage and snored once more

Presently the cabindoor opened gently and the head of the senor
intendant appeared

Tita sat up and then began crawling like a snake along the floor among
the chairs and tables by the light of the cabin lamp

Is he asleep

Yes but the casket is under his head

Curse him How shall we take it

I brought him a fresh pillow halfanhour ago I hung his hammock wrong
on purpose that he might want one I thought to slip the box away as I
did it but the old ox nursed it in both hands all the while

What shall we do in the name of all the fiends She sails tomorrow
morning and then all is lost

Tita showed her white teeth and touched the dagger which hung by the
intendants side

I dare not said the rascal with a shudder

I dare said she He whipt my mother because she would not give me
up to him to be taught in his schools when she went to the mines And
she went to the mines and died there in three months I saw her go
with a chain round her neck but she never came back again Yes I dare
kill him I will kill him I will

The senor felt his mind much relieved He had no wish of course to
commit the murder himself for he was a good Catholic and feared the
devil But Tita was an Indian and her being lost did not matter so
much Indians souls were cheap like their bodies So he answered But
we shall be discovered

I will leap out of the window with the casket and swim ashore They
will never suspect you and they will fancy I am drowned

The sharks may seize you Tita You had better give me the casket

Tita smiled You would not like to lose that eh though you care
little about losing me And yet you told me that you loved me

And I do love you Tita light of my eyes life of my heart I swear
by all the saints I love you I will marry you I swear I willI will
swear on the crucifix if you like

Swear then or I do not give you the casket said she holding out
the little crucifix round her neck and devouring him with the wild eyes
of passionate unreasoning tropic love

He swore trembling and deadly pale

Give me your dagger

No not mine It may be found I shall be suspected What if my sheath
were seen to be empty

Your knife will do His throat is soft enough

And she glided stealthily as a cat toward the hammock while her
cowardly companion stood shivering at the other end of the cabin and
turned his back to her that he might not see the deed

He stood waiting one minutetwofive Was it an hour rather A cold
sweat bathed his limbs the blood beat so fiercely within his temples
that his head rang again Was that a deathbell tolling No it was the
pulses of his brain Impossible surely a deathbell Whence could it
come

There was a struggleah she was about it now a stifled cryAh he
had dreaded that most of all to hear the old man cry Would there be
much blood He hoped not Another struggle and Titas voice apparently
muffled called for help

I cannot help you Mother of Mercies I dare not help you hissed he
Shedevil you have begun it and you must finish it yourself

A heavy arm from behind clasped his throat The bishop had broken loose
from her and seized him Or was it his ghost or a fiend come to drag
him down to the pit And forgetting all but mere wild terror he opened
his lips for a scream which would have wakened every soul on board But
a handkerchief was thrust into his mouth and in another minute he found
himself bound hand and foot and laid upon the table by a gigantic
enemy The cabin was full of armed men two of whom were lashing up
the bishop in his hammock two more had seized Tita and more were
clambering up into the sterngallery beyond wild figures with bright
blades and armor gleaming in the starlight

Now Will whispered the giant who had seized him forward and
clap the forehatches on and shout Fire with all your might Girl
murderess your life is in my hands Tell me where the commander sleeps
and I pardon you

Tita looked up at the huge speaker and obeyed in silence The intendant
heard him enter the colonels cabin and then a short scuffle and
silence for a moment

But only for a moment for already the alarm had been given and mad
confusion reigned through every deck Amyas for it was none other had
already gained the poop the sentinels were gagged and bound and every
halfnaked wretch who came trembling up on deck in his shirt by the main
hatchway calling one Fire another Wreck and another Treason
was hurled into the scuppers and there secured

Lower away that boat shouted Amyas in Spanish to his first batch of
prisoners

The men unarmed and naked could but obey

Now then jump in Here hand them to the gangway as they come up

It was done and as each appeared he was kicked to the scuppers and
bundled down over the side

Shes full Cast loose now and off with you If you try to board again
well sink you

Fire fire shouted Cary forward Up the main hatchway for your
lives

The ruse succeeded utterly and before halfanhour was over all the
ships boats which could be lowered were filled with Spaniards in their
shirts getting ashore as best they could

Here is a new sort of camisado quoth Cary The last Spanish one
I saw was at the sortie from Smerwick but this is somewhat more
prosperous than that

Get the main and foresail up Will said Amyas cut the cable and we
will plume the quarry as we fly

Spoken like a good falconer Heaven grant that this big woodcock may
carry a good trail inside

Ill warrant her for that said Jack Brimblecombe She floats so
low

Much of your build too Jack By the by where is the commander

Alas Don Pedro forgotten in the bustle had been lying on the deck
in his shirt helplessly bound exhausting that part of his vocabulary
which related to the unseen world Which most discourteous act seemed at
first likely to be somewhat heavily avenged on Amyas for as he spoke a
couple of calivershots fired from under the poop passed ping ping
by his ears and Cary clapped his hand to his side

Hurt Will

A pinch old ladLook out or we are allen verloren after all as
the Flemings say

And as he spoke a rush forward on the poop drove two of their best men
down the ladder into the waist where Amyas stood

Killed asked he as he picked one up who had fallen head over heels

Sound as a bell sir but they Gentiles has got hold of the firearms
and set the captain free

And rubbing the back of his head for a minute he jumped up the ladder
again shouting

Have at ye idolatrous pagans Have at ye Satans spawn

Amyas jumped up after him shouting to all hands to follow for there
was no time to be lost

Out of the windows of the poop which looked on the maindeck a galling
fire had been opened and he could not afford to lose men for as far
as he knew the Spaniards left on board might still far outnumber the
English so up he sprang on the poop followed by a dozen men and there
began a very heavy fight between two parties of valiant warriors who
easily knew each other apart by the peculiar fashion of their armor For
the Spaniards fought in their shirts and in no other garments but the
English in all other manner of garments tag rag and bobtail and yet
had never a shirt between them

The rest of the English made a rush of course to get upon the poop
seeing that the Spaniards could not shoot them through the deck but
the fire from the windows was so hot that although they dodged behind
masts spars and every possible shelter one or two dropped and Jack
Brimblecombe and Yeo took on themselves to call a retreat and with
about a dozen men got back and held a council of war

What was to be done Their arquebuses were of little use for the
Spaniards were behind a strong bulkhead There were cannon but where
was powder or shot The boats encouraged by the clamor on deck were
paddling alongside again Yeo rushed round and round probing every gun
with his sword

Heres a patararo loaded Now for a match lads

Luckily one of the English had kept his match alight during the scuffle

Thanks be Help me to unship the gunthe masts in the way here

The patararo or brass swivel was unshipped

Steady lads and keep it level or youll shake out the priming Ship
it here turn out that one and heave it into that boat if they come
alongside Steady nowso Rummage about and find me a bolt or two
a marlinspike anything Quick or the captain will be overmastered
yet

Missiles were foundodds and endsand crammed into the swivel up to
the muzzle and in another minute its cargo of notions was crashing
into the poopwindows silencing the fire from thence effectually enough
for the time

Now then a rush forward and right in along the deck shouted Yeo
and the whole party charged through the cabindoors which their shot
had burst open and hewed their way from room to room

In the meanwhile the Spaniards above had fought fiercely but in
spite of superior numbers they had gradually given back before the
demoniacal possession of those blasphemous heretics who fought
not like men but like furies from the pit And by the time that
Brimblecombe and Yeo shouted from the sterngallery below that the
quarterdeck was won few on either side but had their shrewd scratch to
show

Yield senor shouted Amyas to the commander who had been fighting
like a lion back to back with the captain of mariners

Never You have bound me and insulted me Your blood or mine must wipe
out the stain

And he rushed on Amyas There was a few moments heavy fence between
them and then Amyas cut right at his head But as he raised his arm
the Spaniards blade slipped along his ribs and snapped against the
point of his shoulderblade An inch more to the left and it would have
been through his heart The blow fell nevertheless and the commandant
fell with it stunned by the flat of the sword but not wounded
for Amyass hand had turned as he winced from his wound But the
seacaptain seeing Amyas stagger sprang at him and seizing him by
the wrist ere he could raise his sword again shortened his weapon to
run him through Amyas made a grasp at his wrist in return but between
his faintness and the darkness missed itAnother moment and all
would have been over

A bright blade flashed close past Amyass ear the seacaptains grasp
loosened and he dropped a corpse while over him like an angry lioness
above her prey stood Ayacanora her long hair floating in the wind her
dagger raised aloft as she looked round challenging all and every one
to approach

Are you hurt panted she

A scratch childWhat do you do here Go back go back

Ayacanora slipped back like a scolded child and vanished in the
darkness

The battle was over The Spaniards seeing their commanders fall laid
down their arms and cried for quarter It was given the poor fellows
were tied together two and two and seated in a row on the deck the
commandant sorely bruised yielded himself perforce and the galleon
was taken

Amyas hurried forward to get the sails set As he went down the
poopladder there was some one sitting on the lowest step

Who is herewounded

I am not wounded said a womans voice low and stifled with sobs

It was Ayacanora She rose and let him pass He saw that her face was
bright with tears but he hurried on nevertheless

Perhaps I did speak a little hastily to her considering she saved my
life but what a brimstone it is Mary Ambree in a dark skin Now then
lads Get the Santa Fe gold up out of the canoes and then we will put
her head to the northeast and away for Old England Mr Brimblecombe
dont say that Eastwardho dont bring luck this time

It was impossible till morning dawned either to get matters into any
order or to overhaul the prize they had taken and many of the men were
so much exhausted that they fell fast asleep on the deck ere the surgeon
had time to dress their wounds However Amyas contrived when once the
ship was leaping merrily closehauled against a fresh landbreeze
to count his little flock and found out of the fortyfour but six
seriously wounded and none killed However their working numbers were
now reduced to thirtyeight beside the four negroes a scanty crew
enough to take home such a ship to England

After awhile up came Jack Brimblecombe on deck a bottle in his hand

Lads a prize

Well we know that already

Nay butlook hither and laid in ice too as I live the luxurious
dogs But I had to fight for it I had For when I went down into the
state cabin after I had seen to the wounded whom should I find loose
but that Indian lass who had just unbound the fellow you caught

Ah those two I believe were going to murder the old man in the
hammock if we had not come in the nick of time What have you done with
them

Why the Spaniard ran when he saw me and got into a cabin but the
woman instead of running came at me with a knife and chased me round
the table like a very catamountain So I ducked under the old mans
hammock and out into the gallery and when I thought the coast was
clear back again I came and stumbled over this So I just picked it
up and ran on deck with my tail between my legs for I expected
verily to have the black womans knife between my ribs out of some dark
corner

Well done Jack Lets have the wine nevertheless and then down to
set a guard on the cabin doors for fear of plundering

Better go down and see that nothing is thrown overboard by Spaniards
As for plundering I will settle that

And Amyas walked forward among the men

Muster the men boatswain and count them

All here sir but the six poor fellows who are laid forward

Now my men said Amyas for three years you and I have wandered
on the face of the earth seeking our fortune and we have found it at
last thanks be to God Now what was our promise and vow which we made
to God beneath the tree of Guayra if He should grant us good fortune
and bring us home again with a prize Was it not that the dead should
share with the living and that every mans portion if he fell should
go to his widow or his orphans or if he had none to his parents

It was sir said Yeo and I trust that the Lord will give these men
grace to keep their vow They have seen enough of His providences by
this time to fear Him

I doubt them not but I remind them of it The Lord has put into our
hands a rich prize and what with the gold which we have already we are
well paid for all our labors Let us thank Him with fervent hearts
as soon as the sun rises and in the meanwhile remember all that
whosoever plunders on his private account robs not the adventurers
merely but the orphan and the widow which is to rob God and makes
himself partaker of Achans curse who hid the wedge of gold and
brought down Gods anger on the whole army of Israel For me lest you
should think me covetous I could claim my brothers share but I hereby
give it up freely into the common stock for the use of the whole ships
crew who have stood by me through weal and woe as men never stood
before as I believe by any captain So now to prayers lads and then
to eat our breakfast

So to the Spaniards surprise who most of them believed that the
English were atheists to prayers they went

After which Brimblecombe contrived to inspire the black cook and the
Portuguese steward with such energy that by seven oclock the latter
worthy appeared on deck and with profound reverences announced to
The most excellent and heroical Senor Adelantado Captain Englishman
that breakfast was ready in the statecabin

You will do us the honor of accompanying us as our guest sir or our
host if you prefer the title said Amyas to the commandant who stood
by

Pardon senor but honor forbids me to eat with one who has offered to
me the indelible insult of bonds

Oh said Amyas taking off his hat then pray accept on the spot my
humble apologies for all which has passed and my assurances that the
indignities which you have unfortunately endured were owing altogether
to the necessities of war and not to any wish to hurt the feelings of
so valiant a soldier and gentleman

It is enough senor said the commandant bowing and shrugging his
shouldersfor indeed he too was very hungry while Cary whispered to
Amyas

You will make a courtier yet old lad

I am not in jesting humor Will my mind sadly misgives me that we
shall hear black news and have perhaps to do a black deed yet on
board here Senor I follow you

So they went down and found the bishop who was by this time unbound
seated in a corner of the cabin his hands fallen on his knees his eyes
staring on vacancy while the two priests stood as close against the
wall as they could squeeze themselves keeping up a ceaseless mutter of
prayers

Your holiness will breakfast with us of course and these two frocked
gentlemen likewise I see no reason for refusing them all hospitality
as yet

There was a marked emphasis on the last two words which made both monks
wince

Our chaplain will attend to you gentlemen His lordship the bishop
will do me the honor of sitting next to me

The bishop seemed to revive slowly as he snuffed the savory steam
and at last rising mechanically subsided into the chair which Amyas
offered him on his left while the commandant sat on his right

A little of this kid my lord NoahFriday I recollect Some of
that turtlefin then Will serve his lordship pass the cassavabread
up Jack Senor commandant a glass of wine You need it after your
valiant toils To the health of all brave soldiersand a toast from
your own Spanish proverb Today to me tomorrow to thee

I drink it brave senor Your courtesy shows you the worthy countryman
of General Drake and his brave lieutenant

Drake Did you know him senor asked all the Englishmen at once

Too well too well and he would have continued but the bishop burst
out

Ah senor commandant that name again Have you no mercy To sit
between another pair of and my own wine too Ugh ugh

The old gentleman whose mouth had been full of turtle the whole time
burst into a violent fit of coughing and was only saved from apoplexy
by Carys patting him on the back

Ugh ugh The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel and their
precious balms Ah senor lieutenant Englishman May I ask you to pass
those limesAh what is turtle without limeEven as a fat old man
without money Nudus intravi nudus exeoah

But what of Drake

Do you not know sir that he and his fleet only last year swept the
whole of this coast and took with shame I confess it Cartagena San
Domingo St Augustine andI see you are too courteous senors to
express before me what you have a right to feel But whence come you
sir From the skies or the depth of the sea

Artmagic artmagic moaned the bishop

Your holiness It is scarcely prudent to speak thus here said the
commandant who was nevertheless much of the same opinion

Why you said so yourself last night senor about the taking of
Cartagena

The commandant blushed and stammered out somewhatThat it was
excusable in him if he had said in jest that so prodigious and
curious a valor had not sprung from mortal source

No more it did senor said Jack Brimblecombe stoutly but from Him
who taught our hands to war and our fingers to fight

The commandant bowed stiffly You will excuse me sir preacher but I
am a Catholic and hold the cause of my king to be alone the cause of
Heaven But senor captain how came you thither if I may ask That you
needed no artmagic after you came on board I alas can testify but
too well but what spiritwhether good or evil I ask notbrought you
on board and whence Where is your ship I thought that all Drakes
squadron had left six months ago

Our ship senor has lain this three years rotting on the coast near
Cape Codera

Ah we heard of that bold adventurebut we thought you all lost in the
interior

You did Can you tell me then where the senor governor of La Guayra
may be now

The Senor Don Guzman de Soto said the commandant in a somewhat
constrained tone is said to be at present in Spain having thrown up
his office in consequence of domestic matters of which I have not the
honor of knowing anything

Amyas longed to ask more but he knew that the wellbred Spaniard would
tell him nothing which concerned another mans wife and went on

What befell us after I tell you frankly

And Amyas told his story from the landing at Guayra to the passage down
the Magdalena The commandant lifted up his hands

Were it not forbidden to me as a Catholic most invincible senor I
should say that the Divine protection has indeed

Ah said one of the friars that you could be brought senors to
render thanks for your miraculous preservation to her to whom alone it
is due Mary the fount of mercies

We have done well enough without her as yet said Amyas bluntly

The Lord raised up Nebuchadnezzar of old to punish the sins of the
Jewish Church and He has raised up these men to punish ours said Fray
Gerundio

But Nebuchadnezzar fell and so may they growled the other to
himself Jack overheard him

I say my lord bishop called he from the other end of the table It
is our English custom to let our guests be as rude as they like but
perhaps your lordship will hint to these two friars that if they wish
to keep whole skins they will keep civil tongues

Be silent asses mules shouted the bishop whose spirits were
improving over the wine who are you that you cannot eat dirt as well
as your betters

Well spoken my lord Heres the health of our saintly and venerable
guest said Cary while the commandant whispered to Amyas Fat old
tyrant I hope you have found his moneyfor I am sure he has some on
board and I should be loath that you lost the advantage of it

I shall have to say a few words to you about that money this morning
commandant by the by they had better be said now My lord bishop do
you know that had we not taken this ship when we did you had lost not
merely money as you have now but life itself

Money I had none to lose Lifewhat do you mean asked the bishop
turning very pale

This sir That it ill befits one to lie whose throat has been saved
from the assassins knife but four hours since When we entered the
sterngallery we found two persons now on board this ship in the very
act sir and article of cutting your sinful throat that they might
rob you of the casket which lay beneath your pillow A moment more and
you were dead We seized and bound them and so saved your life Is that
plain sir

The bishop looked steadfastly and stupidly into Amyass face heaved a
deep sigh and gradually sank back in his chair dropping the glass from
his hand

He is in a fit Call in the surgeon Run and up jumped kindhearted
Jack and brought in the surgeon of the galleon

Is this possible senor asked the commandant

It is true Door there Evans go and bring in that rascal whom we
left bound in his cabin

Evans went and the commandant continued

But the sterngallery How in the name of all witches and miracles
came your valor thither

Simply enough and owing neither to witch nor miracle The night before
last we passed the mouth of the bay in our two canoes which we had
lashed together after the fashion I had seen in the Moluccas to keep
them afloat in the surf We had scraped the canoes bright the day
before and rubbed them with white clay that they might be invisible at
night and so we got safely to the Morro Grande passing within half a
mile of your ship

Oh my scoundrels of sentinels

We landed at the back of the Morro and lay there all day being
purposed to do that which with your pardon we have done We took our
sails of Indian cloth whitened them likewise with clay which we had
brought with us from the river expecting to find a Spanish ship as we
went along the coast and determined to attempt her or die with honor
and laid them over us on the canoes paddling from underneath them So
that had your sentinels been awake they would have hardly made us
out till we were close on board We had provided ourselves instead
of ladders with bamboos rigged with crosspieces and a hook of strong
wood at the top of each they hang at your sterngallery now And the
rest of the tale I need not tell you

The commandant rose in his courtly Spanish way

Your admirable story senor proves to me how truly your nation while
it has yet and I trust will ever have to dispute the palm of valor
with our own is famed throughout the world for ingenuity and for
daring beyond that of mortal man You have succeeded valiant captain
because you have deserved to succeed and it is no shame to me to
succumb to enemies who have united the cunning of the serpent with the
valor of the lion Senor I feel as proud of becoming your guest as I
should have been proud under a happier star of becoming your host

You are like your nation only too generous senor But what noise is
that outside Cary go and see

But ere Cary could reach the door it was opened and Evans presented
himself with a terrified face

Heres villainy sir The Dons murdered and cold the Indian lass
fled and as we searched the ship for her we found an Englishwoman as
Im a sinful manand a shocking sight she is to see

An Englishwoman cried all three springing forward

Bring her in said Amyas turning very pale and as he spoke Yeo and
another led into the cabin a figure scarcely human

An elderly woman dressed in the yellow San Benito of the Inquisition
with ragged gray locks hanging about a countenance distorted by
suffering and shrunk by famine Painfully as one unaccustomed to the
light she peered and blinked round her Her fallen lip gave her a
halfidiotic expression and yet there was an uneasy twinkle in the eye
as of boundless terror and suspicion She lifted up her fettered wrist
to shade her face and as she did so disclosed a line of fearful scars
upon her skinny arm

Look there sirs said Yeo pointing to them with a stern smile
Heres some of these Popish gentrys handiwork I know well enough how
those marks came and he pointed to the similar scars on his own wrist

The commandant as well as the Englishmen recoiled with horror

Holy Virgin what wretch is this on board my ship Bishop is this the
prisoner whom you sent on board

The bishop who had been slowly recovering his senses looked at her a
moment and then thrusting his chair back crossed himself and almost
screamed Malefica Malefica Who brought her here Turn her away
gentlemen turn her eye away she will bewitch fascinateand he began
muttering prayers

Amyas seized him by the shoulder and shook him on to his legs

Swine who is this Wake up coward and tell me or I will cut you
piecemeal

But ere the bishop could answer the woman uttered a wild shriek and
pointing to the taller of the two monks cowered behind Yeo

He here cried she in broken Spanish Take me away I will tell you
no more I have told you all and lies enough beside Oh why is he come
again Did they not say that I should have no more torments

The monk turned pale but like a wild beast at bay glared firmly round
on the whole company and then fixing his dark eyes full on the woman
he bade her be silent so sternly that she shrank down like a beaten
hound

Silence dog said Will Cary whose blood was up and followed his
words with a blow on the monks mouth which silenced him effectually

Dont be afraid good woman but speak English We are all English
here and Protestants too Tell us what they have done for you

Another trap another trap cried she in a strong Devonshire accent
You be no English You want to make me lie again and then torment me
Oh wretched wretched that I am cried she bursting into tears Whom
should I trust Not myself no nor God for I have denied Him O Lord
O Lord

Amyas stood silent with fear and horror some instinct told him that he
was on the point of hearing news for which he feared to ask But Jack
spoke

My dear soul my dear soul dont you be afraid and the Lord will
stand by you if you will but tell the truth We are all Englishmen and
men of Devon as you seem to be by your speech and this ship is ours
and the pope himself shant touch you

Devon she said doubtingly Devon Whence then

Bideford men This is Mr Will Cary to Clovelly If you are a Devon
woman youve heard tell of the Carys to be sure

The woman made a rush forward and threw her fettered arms round Wills
neck

Oh Mr Cary my dear life Mr Cary and so you be Oh dear soul
alive but youre burnt so brown and I be most blind with misery Oh
who ever sent you here my dear Mr Will then to save a poor wretch
from the pit

Who on earth are you

Lucy Passmore the white witch to Welcombe Dont you mind Lucy
Passmore as charmed your warts for you when you was a boy

Lucy Passmore almost shrieked all three friends She that went off
with

Yes she that sold her own soul and persuaded that dear saint to
sell hers she that did the devils work and has taken the devils
wagesafter this fashion and she held up her scarred wrists wildly

Where is Dona deRose Salterne shouted Will and Jack

Where is my brother Frank shouted Amyas

Dead dead dead

I knew it said Amyas sitting down again calmly

How did she die

The Inquisitionhe pointing to the monk Ask himhe betrayed her
to her death And ask him pointing to the bishop he sat by her and
saw her die

Woman you rave said the bishop getting up with a terrified air and
moving as far as possible from Amyas

How did my brother die Lucy asked Amyas still calmly

Who be you sir

A gleam of hope flashed across Amyasshe had not answered his question

I am Amyas Leigh of Burrough Do you know aught of my brother Frank
who was lost at La Guayra

Mr Amyas Heaven forgive me that I did not know the bigness of you
Your brother sir died like a gentleman as he was

But how gasped Amyas

Burned with her sir

Is this true sir said Amyas turning to the bishop with a very
quiet voice

I sir stammered he in panting haste I had nothing to doI was
compelled in my office of bishop to be an unwilling spectatorthe
secular arm sir I could not interfere with thatany more than I can
with the Holy Office I do not belong to itask that gentlemansir
Saints and angels sir what are you going to do shrieked he as Amyas
laid a heavy hand upon his shoulder and began to lead him towards the
door

Hang you said Amyas If I had been a Spaniard and a priest like
yourself I should have burnt you alive

Hang me shrieked the wretched old Balaam and burst into abject howls
for mercy

Take the dark monk Yeo and hang him too Lucy Passmore do you know
that fellow also

No sir said Lucy

Lucky for you Fray Gerundio said Will Cary while the good friar
hid his face in his hands and burst into tears Lucky it was for
him indeed for he had been a pitying spectator of the tragedy Ah
thought he if life in this mad and sinful world be a reward perhaps
this escape is vouchsafed to me for having pleaded the cause of the poor
Indian

But the bishop shrieked on

Oh not yet An hour only an hour I am not fit to die

That is no concern of mine said Amyas I only know that you are not
fit to live

Let us at least make our peace with God said the dark monk

Hound if your saints can really smuggle you up the backstairs
to heaven they will do it without five minutes more coaxing and
flattering

Fray Gerundio and the condemned man alike stopped their ears at the
blasphemy

Oh Fray Gerundio screamed the bishop pray for me I have treated
you like a beast Oh Fray Fray

Oh my lord my lord said the good man as with tears streaming
down his face he followed his shrieking and struggling diocesan up the
stairs who am I Ask no pardon of me Ask pardon of God for all your
sins against the poor innocent savages when you saw your harmless sheep
butchered year after year and yet never lifted up your voice to save
the flock which God had committed to you Oh confess that my lord
confess it ere it be too late

I will confess all about the Indians and the gold and Tita too Fray
peccavi peccavionly five minutes senors five little minutes grace
while I confess to the good Frayand he grovelled on the deck

I will have no such mummery where I command said Amyas sternly I
will be no accomplice in cheating Satan of his due

If you will confess said Brimblecombe whose heart was melting fast
confess to the Lord and He will forgive you Even at the last moment
mercy is open Is it not Fray Gerundio

It is senor it is my lord said Gerundio but the bishop only
clasped his hands over his head

Then I am undone All my money is stolen Not a farthing left to buy
masses for my poor soul And no absolution no viaticum nor anything I
die like a dog and am damned

Clear away that running rigging said Amyas while the dark Dominican
stood perfectly collected with something of a smile of pity at
the miserable bishop A man accustomed to cruelty and firm in his
fanaticism he was as ready to endure suffering as to inflict it
repeating to himself the necessary prayers he called Fray Gerundio to
witness that he died however unworthy a martyr in charity with all
men and in the communion of the Holy Catholic Church and then as
he fitted the cord to his own neck gave Fray Gerundio various petty
commissions about his sister and her children and a little vineyard far
away upon the sunny slopes of Castile and so died with a Domine in
manus tuas like a valiant man of Spain

Amyas stood long in solemn silence watching the two corpses dangling
above his head At last he drew a long breath as if a load was taken
off his heart

Suddenly he looked round to his men who were watching eagerly to know
what he would have done next

Hearken to me my masters all and may God hearken too and do so to
me and more also if as long as I have eyes to see a Spaniard and
hands to hew him down I do any other thing than hunt down that accursed
nation day and night and avenge all the innocent blood which has been
shed by them since the day in which King Ferdinand drove out the Moors

Amen said Salvation Yeo I need not to swear that oath for I have
sworn it long ago and kept it Will your honor have us kill the rest of
the idolaters

God forbid said Cary You would not do that Amyas

No we will spare them God has shown us a great mercy this day and we
must be merciful in it We will land them at Cabo Velo But henceforth
till I die no quarter to a Spaniard

Amen said Yeo

Amyass whole countenance had changed in the last halfhour He seemed
to have grown years older His brow was wrinkled his lip compressed
his eyes full of a terrible stony calm as of one who had formed a great
and dreadful purpose and yet for that very reason could afford to be
quiet under the burden of it even cheerful and when he returned to the
cabin he bowed courteously to the commandant begged pardon of him
for having played the host so ill and entreated him to finish his
breakfast

But senoris it possible Is his holiness dead

He is hanged and dead senor I would have hanged could I have caught
them every living thing which was present at my brothers death even
to the very flies upon the wall No more words senor your conscience
tells you that I am just

Senor said the commandantone wordI trust there are no
listenersnone of my crew I mean but I must exculpate myself in your
eyes

Walk out then into the gallery with me

To tell you the truth senorI trust in Heaven no one overhearsYou
are just This Inquisition is the curse of us the weight which is
crushing out the very life of Spain No man dares speak No man dares
trust his neighbor no not his child or the wife of his bosom It
avails nothing to be a good Catholic as I trust I am and he crossed
himself when any villain whom you may offend any unnatural son or
wife who wishes to be rid of you has but to hint heresy against you
and you vanish into the Holy Officeand then God have mercy on you
for man has none Noble ladies of my family sir have vanished
thither carried off by night we know not why we dare not ask why To
expostulate even to inquire would have been to share their fate There
is one now senorHeaven alone knows whether she is alive or deadIt
was nine years since and we have never heard and we shall never hear

And the commandants face worked frightfully

She was my sister senor

Heavens sir and have you not avenged her

On churchmen senor and I a Catholic To be burned at the stake in
this life and after that to all eternity beside Even a Spaniard
dare not face that Beside sir the mob like this Inquisition and an
Autodafe is even better sport to them than a bullfight They would be
the first to tear a man in pieces who dare touch an Inquisitor Sir
may all the saints in heaven obtain me forgiveness for my blasphemy but
when I saw you just now fearing those churchmen no more than you feared
me I longed sinner that I am to be a heretic like you

It will not take long to make a brave and wise gentleman who has
suffered such things as you have a heretic as you call ita free
Christian man as we call it

Tempt me not sir said the poor man crossing himself fervently Let
us say no more Obedience is my duty and for the rest the Church must
decide according to her infallible authorityfor I am a good Catholic
senor the best of Catholics though a great sinnerI trust no one has
overheard us

Amyas left him with a smile of pity and went to look for Lucy Passmore
whom the sailors were nursing and feeding while Ayacanora watched them
with a puzzled face

I will talk to you when you are better Lucy said he taking her
hand Now you must eat and drink and forget all among us lads of
Devon

Oh dear blessed sir and you will send Sir John to pray with me For
I turned sir I turned but I could not help itI could not abear the
torments but she bore them sweet angeland more than I did Oh dear
me

Lucy I am not fit now to hear more You shall tell me all tomorrow
and he turned away

Why do you take her hand said Ayacanora halfscornfully She is
old and ugly and dirty

She is an Englishwoman child and a martyr poor thing and I would
nurse her as I would my own mother

Why dont you make me an Englishwoman and a martyr I could learn how
to do anything that that old hag could do

Instead of calling her names go and tend her that would be much
fitter work for a woman than fighting among men

Ayacanora darted from him thrust the sailors aside and took possession
of Lucy Passmore

Where shall I put her asked she of Amyas without looking up

In the best cabin and let her be served like a queen lads

No one shall touch her but me and taking up the withered frame in her
arms as if it were a doll Ayacanora walked off with her in triumph
telling the men to go and mind the ship

The girl is mad said one

Mad or not she has an eye to our captain said another

And wheres the man that would behave to the poor wild thing as he
does

Sir Francis Drake would from whom he got his lesson Do you mind his
putting the negro lass ashore after he found out about

Hush Bygones be bygones and those that did it are in their graves
long ago But it was too hard of him on the poor thing

If he had not got rid of her there would have been more throats than
one cut about the lass thats all I know said another and so there
would have been about this one before now if the captain wasnt a born
angel out of heaven and the lieutenant no less

Well I suppose we may get a whet by now I wonder if these Dons have
any beer aboard

Naught but grape vinegar which fools call wine Ill warrant

There was better than vinegar on the table in there just now

Ah said one grumbler of true English breed but thats not for poor
fellows like we

Dont lie Tom Evans you never were given that way yet and I dont
think the trade will suit a good fellow like you

The whole party stared for the speaker of these words was none other
than Amyas himself who had rejoined them a bottle in each hand

No Tom Evans It has been share and share alike for three years
and bravely you have all held up and share alike it shall be now and
heres the handsel of it Well serve out the good wine fairly all round
as long as it lasts and then take to the bad but mind you dont get
drunk my sons for we are much too short of hands to have any stout
fellows lying about the scuppers

But what was the story of the intendants being murdered Brimblecombe
had seen him run into a neighboring cabin and when the door of it
was opened there was the culprit but dead and cold with a deep
knifewound in his side Who could have done the deed It must have been
Tita whom Brimblecombe had seen loose and trying to free her lover

The ship was searched from stem to stern but no Tita The mystery was
never explained That she had leapt overboard and tried to swim ashore
none doubted but whether she had reached it who could tell One thing
was strange that not only had she carried off no treasure with her
but that the gold ornaments which she had worn the night before lay
together in a heap on the table close by the murdered man Had she
wished to rid herself of everything which had belonged to her tyrants

The commandant heard the whole story thoughtfully

Wretched man said he and he has a wife and children in Seville

A wife and children said Amyas and I heard him promise marriage to
the Indian girl

That was the only hint which gave a reason for his death What if
in the terror of discovery and capture the scoundrel had dropped any
selfcondemning words about his marriage any prayer for those whom he
had left behind and the Indian had overheard them It might be so at
least sin had brought its own punishment

And so that wild night and day subsided The prisoners were kindly used
enough for the Englishman free from any petty love of tormenting
knows no mean between killing a foe outright and treating him as a
brother and when two days afterwards they were sent ashore in the
canoes off Cabo Velo captives and captors shook hands all round and
Amyas after returning the commandant his sword and presenting him with
a case of the bishops wine bowed him courteously over the side

I trust that you will pay us another visit valiant senor capitan
said the Spaniard bowing and smiling

I should most gladly accept your invitation illustrious senor
commandant but as I have vowed henceforth whenever I shall meet a
Spaniard neither to give nor take quarter I trust that our paths to
glory may lie in different directions

The commandant shrugged his shoulders the ship was put again before the
wind and as the shores of the Main faded lower and dimmer behind her
a mighty cheer broke from all on board and for once the cry from every
mouth was Eastwardho

Scrap by scrap as weakness and confusion of intellect permitted her
Lucy Passmore told her story It was a simple one after all and Amyas
might almost have guessed it for himself Rose had not yielded to the
Spaniard without a struggle He had visited her two or three times at
Lucys house how he found out Lucys existence she herself could never
tell unless from the Jesuits before she agreed to go with him He had
gained Lucy to his side by huge promises of Indian gold and in fine
they had gone to Lundy where the lovers were married by a priest who
was none other Lucy would swear than the shorter and stouter of the
two who had carried off her husband and his boatin a word Father
Parsons

Amyas gnashed his teeth at the thought that he had had Parsons in his
power at Brenttor down and let him go It was a fresh proof to him that
Heavens vengeance was upon him for letting one of its enemies escape
Though what good to Rose or Frank the hanging of Parsons would have
been I for my part cannot see

But when had Eustace been at Lundy Lucy could throw no light on that
matter It was evidently some bythread in the huge spiders web of
Jesuit intrigue which was perhaps not worth knowing after all

They sailed from Lundy in a Portugal ship were at Lisbon a few days
during which Rose and Lucy remained on board and then away for the
West Indies while all went merry as a marriage bell Sir he would
have kissed the dust off her dear feet till that evil eye of Mr
Eustaces came no one knew how or whence And from that time all
went wrong Eustace got power over Don Guzman whether by threatening
that the marriage should be dissolved whether by working on his
superstitious scruples about leaving his wife still a heretic or
whether and this last Lucy much suspected by insinuations that her
heart was still at home in England and that she was longing for Amyas
and his ship to come and take her home again the house soon became a
den of misery and Eustace the presiding evil genius Don Guzman had
even commanded him to leave itand he went but somehow within a week
he was there again in greater favor than ever Then came preparations
to meet the English and high words about it between Don Guzman and
Rose till a few days before Amyass arrival the Don had dashed out
of the house in a fury saying openly that she preferred these Lutheran
dogs to him and that he would have their hearts blood first and hers
after

The rest was soon told Amyas knew but too much of it already The very
morning after he had gone up to the villa Lucy and her mistress were
taken they knew not by whom down to the quay in the name of the Holy
Office and shipped off to Cartagena

There they were examined and confronted on a charge of witchcraft
which the wretched Lucy could not well deny She was tortured to
make her inculpate Rose and what she said or did not say under the
torture the poor wretch could never tell She recanted and became a
Romanist Rose remained firm Three weeks afterwards they were brought
out to an Autodafe and there for the first time Lucy saw Frank
walking dressed in a San Benito in that ghastly procession Lucy was
adjudged to receive publicly two hundred stripes and to be sent to
The Holy House at Seville to perpetual prison Frank and Rose with
a renegade Jew and a negro who had been convicted of practising Obi
were sentenced to death as impenitent and delivered over to the
secular arm with prayers that there might be no shedding of blood In
compliance with which request the Jew and the negro were burnt at one
stake Frank and Rose at another She thought they did not feel it more
than twenty minutes They were both very bold and steadfast and held
each others hand that she would swear to to the very last

And so ended Lucy Passmores story And if Amyas Leigh after he had
heard it vowed afresh to give no quarter to Spaniards wherever he
should find them who can wonder even if they blame



CHAPTER XXVII

HOW SALVATION YEO FOUND HIS LITTLE MAID AGAIN

 All precious things discoverd late
 To them who seek them issue forth
 For love in sequel works with fate
 And draws the veil from hidden worth

 The Sleeping Beauty

And so Ayacanora took up her abode in Lucys cabin as a regularly
accredited member of the crew

But a most troublesome member for now began in her that perilous crisis
which seems to endanger the bodies and souls of all savages and savage
tribes when they first mingle with the white man that crisis which
a few years afterwards began to hasten the extermination of the North
American tribes and had it not been for the admirable good sense and
constancy of Amyas Ayacanora might have ended even more miserably than
did the farfamed Pocahontas daughter of the Virginian king who after
having been received at Court by the old pedant James the First
with the honors of a sister sovereign and having become the reputed
ancestress of more than one ancient Virginian family ended her days in
wretchedness in some Wapping garret

For the mind of the savage crushed by the sight of the white mans
superior skill and wealth and wisdom loses at first its selfrespect
while his body pampered with easily obtained luxuries instead
of having to win the necessaries of life by heavy toil loses its
selfhelpfulness and with selfrespect and selfhelp vanish all the
savage virtues few and flimsy as they are and the downward road toward
begging and stealing sottishness and idleness is easy if not sure

And down that road it really seemed at first that poor Ayacanora was
walking fast For the warriorprophetess of the Omaguas soon became to
all appearance nothing but a very naughty child and the Diana of the
Meta after she had satisfied her simple wonder at the great floating
house by rambling from deck to deck and peeping into every cupboard
and cranny manifested a great propensity to steal and hide she was too
proud or too shy to ask for every trumpery which smit her fancy and
when Amyas forbade her to take anything without leave threatened
to drown herself and went off and sulked all day in her cabin
Nevertheless she obeyed him except in the matter of sweet things
Perhaps she craved naturally for the vegetable food of her native
forests at all events the bishops stores of fruit and sweetmeats
diminished rapidly and what was worse so did the sweet Spanish wine
which Amyas had set apart for poor Lucys daily cordial Whereon another
severe lecture in which Amyas told her how mean it was to rob poor
sick Lucy whereat she as usual threatened to drown herself and was
running upon deck to do it when Amyas caught her and forgave her On
which a violent fit of crying and great penitence and promises and
a week after Amyas found that she had cheated Satan and her own
conscience by tormenting the Portuguese steward into giving her some
other wine instead but luckily for her she found Amyass warnings
about wine making her mad so far fulfilled that she did several foolish
things one evening and had a bad headache next morning so the murder
was out and Amyas ordered the steward up for a sound flogging but
Ayacanora honorably enough not only begged him off but offered to be
whipped instead of him confessing that the poor fellow spoke truly when
he swore that she had threatened to kill him and that he had given her
the wine in bodily fear for his life

However her own headache and Amyass cold looks were lesson enough and
after another attempt to drown herself the wilful beauty settled down
for awhile and what was better could hardly be persuaded thenceforth
to her dying day to touch fermented liquors

But in the meanwhile poor Amyas had many a brainsbeating as to how
he was to tame a lady who on the least provocation took refuge in
suicide Punish her he dared not even if he had the heart And as for
putting her ashore he had an instinct and surely not a superstitious
one that her strange affection for the English was not unsent by
Heaven and that God had committed her into his charge and that He
would require an account at his hands of the soul of that fair lost
lamb

So almost at his wits end he prayed to God good simple fellow and
that many a time to show him what he should do with her before she
killed either herself or what was just as likely one of the crew and
it seemed best to him to make Parson Jack teach her the rudiments of
Christianity that she might be baptized in due time when they got home
to England

But here arose a fresh troublefor she roundly refused to learn of
Jack or of any one but Amyas himself while he had many a good reason
for refusing the office of schoolmaster so for a week or two more
Ayacanora remained untaught save in the English tongue which she
picked up with marvellous rapidity

And next as if troubles would never end she took a violent dislike
not only to John Brimblecombe whose gait and voice she openly mimicked
for the edification of the men but also to Will Cary whom she never
allowed to speak to her or approach her Perhaps she was jealous of his
intimacy with Amyas or perhaps with the subtle instinct of a woman
she knew that he was the only other man on board who might dare to make
love to her though Will to do him justice was as guiltless of any
such intention as Amyas himself But when she was remonstrated with
her only answer was that Cary was a cacique as well as Amyas and that
there ought not to be two caciques and one day she actually proposed to
Amyas to kill his supposed rival and take the ship all to himself
and sulked for several days at hearing Amyas amid shouts of laughter
retail her precious advice to its intended victim

Moreover the negroes came in for their share being regarded all along
by her with an unspeakable repugnance which showed itself at first in
hiding from them whenever she could and afterwards in throwing at
them everything she could lay hands on till the poor Quashies in
danger of their lives complained to Amyas and got rest for awhile

Over the rest of the sailors she lorded it like a very princess calling
them from their work to run on her errands and make toys for her
enforcing her commands now and then by a shrewd box on the ears while
the good fellows especially old Yeo like true sailors petted her
obeyed her even jested with her much as they might have done with a
tame leopard whose claws might be unsheathed and about their ears at
any moment But she amused them and amused Amyas too They must of
course have a pet and what prettier one could they have And as for
Amyas the constant interest of her presence even the constant
anxiety of her wilfulness kept his mind busy and drove out many a sad
foreboding about that meeting with his mother and the tragedy which
he had to tell her which would otherwise so heavily did they weigh on
him have crushed his spirit with melancholy and made all his worldly
success and marvellous deliverance worthless in his eyes

At last the matter as most things luckily do came to a climax and it
came in this way

The ship had been slipping along now for many a day slowly but steadily
before a favorable breeze She had passed the ring of the West India
islands and was now crawling safe from all pursuit through the vast
weedbeds of the Sargasso Sea There for the first time it was thought
safe to relax the discipline which had been hitherto kept up and to
rummage as was the word in those days their noble prize What they
found of gold and silver jewels and merchandise will interest no
readers Suffice it to say that there was enough there with the other
treasure to make Amyas rich for life after all claims of Carys and
the crew not forgetting Mr Salternes third as owner of the ship
had been paid off But in the captains cabin were found two chests one
full of gorgeous Mexican feather dresses and the other of Spanish and
East Indian finery which having come by way of Havana and Cartagena
was going on it seemed to some senora or other at the Caracas Which
two chests were at Carys proposal voted amid the acclamations of
the crew to Ayacanora as her due and fit share of the pillage in
consideration of her Amazonian prowess and valuable services

So the poor child took greedy possession of the trumpery had them
carried into Lucys cabin and there knelt gloating over them many an
hour The Mexican work she chose to despise as savage but the Spanish
dresses were a treasure and for two or three days she appeared on the
quarterdeck sunning herself like a peacock before the eyes of Amyas in
Seville mantillas Madrid hats Indian brocade farthingales and I know
not how many other gewgaws and dare not say how put on

The crew tittered Amyas felt much more inclined to cry There is
nothing so pathetic as a childs vanity saving a grown person aping a
childs vanity and saving too a childs agony of disappointment when
it finds that it has been laughed at instead of being admired Amyas
would have spoken but he was afraid however the evil brought its own
cure The pageant went on as its actor thought most successfully
for three days or so but at last the dupe unable to contain herself
longer appealed to AmyasAyacanora quite English girl now is she
notheard a titter behind her looked round saw a dozen honest
faces in broad grin comprehended all in a moment darted down the
companionladder and vanished

Amyas fully expecting her to jump overboard followed as fast as he
could But she had locked herself in with Lucy and he could hear her
violent sobs and Lucys faint voice entreating to know what was the
matter

In vain he knocked She refused to come out all day and at even they
were forced to break the door open to prevent Lucy being starved

There sat Ayacanora her finery half torn off and scattered about the
floor in spite crying still as if her heart would break while poor
Lucy cried too half from fright and hunger and half for company

Amyas tried to comfort the poor child assured her that the men should
never laugh at her again But then added he you must not be
soso What to say he hardly knew

So what asked she crying more bitterly than ever

So like a wild girl Ayacanora

Her hands dropped on her knees a strong spasm ran through her
throat and bosom and she fell on her knees before him and looked up
imploringly in his face

Yes wild girlpoor bad wild girl    But I will be English girl
now

Fine clothes will never make you English my child said Amyas

No not English clothesEnglish heart Good heart like yours Yes I
will be good and Sir John shall teach me

Theres my good maid said Amyas Sir John shall begin and teach you
tomorrow

No Now now Ayacanora cannot wait She will drown herself if she is
bad another day Come now

And she made him fetch Brimblecombe heard the honest fellow patiently
for an hour or more and told Lucy that very night all that he had said
And from that day whenever Jack went in to read and pray with the
poor sufferer Ayacanora instead of escaping on deck as before stood
patiently trying to make it all out and knelt when he knelt and tried
to pray toothat she might have an English heart and doubtless her
prayers dumb as they were were not unheard

So went on a few days more hopefully enough without any outbreak till
one morning just after they had passed the Sargassobeds The ship
was taking care of herself the men were all on deck under the awning
tinkering and cobbling and chatting Brimblecombe was catechising his
fair pupil in the cabin Amyas and Cary cigar in mouth were chatting
about all heaven and earth and above all of the best way of getting
up a fresh adventure against the Spaniards as soon as they returned
while Amyas was pouring out to Will that dark hatred of the whole
nation that dark purpose of revenge for his brother and for Rose which
had settled down like a murky cloud into every cranny of his heart and
mind Suddenly there was a noise below a scuffle and a shout
which made them both leap to their feet and up on deck rushed Jack
Brimblecombe holding his head on with both his hands

Save me save me from that shefiend She is possessed with a legion
She has broken my nosetorn out half my hairand Im sure I have none
to spare Here she comes Stand by me gentlemen both Satanas I defy
thee And Jack ensconced himself behind the pair as Ayacanora whirled
upon deck like a very Maenad and seeing Amyas stopped short

If you had defied Satan down below there said Cary with a laugh I
suspect he wouldnt have broken out on you so boldly Master Jack

I am innocentinnocent as the babe unborn Oh Mr Cary this is too
bad of you sir quoth Jack indignantly while Amyas asked what was the
matter

He looked at me said she sturdily

Well a cat may look at a king

But he shant look at Ayacanora Nobody shall but you or Ill kill
him

In vain Jack protested his innocence of having even looked at her The
fancy and I verily believe it was nothing more had taken possession of
her She refused to return below to her lesson Jack went off grumbling
minus his hair and wore a black eye for a week after

At all events quoth Cary relighting his cigar its a fault on the
right side

God give me grace or it may be one on the wrong side for me

He will old heartofoak said Cary laying his arm around Amyass
neck to the evident disgust of Ayacanora who went off to the side
got a fishingline and began amusing herself therewith while the ship
slipped on quietly and silently as ever save when Ayacanora laughed and
clapped her hands at the flyingfish scudding from the bonitos At last
tired of doing nothing she went forward to the pooprail to listen to
John Squire the armorer who sat tinkering a headpiece and humming a
song mutato nomine concerning his native place

 Oh Bideford is a pleasant place it shines where it stands
 And the more I look upon it the more my heart it warms
 For there are fair young lasses in rows upon the quay
 To welcome gallant mariners when they come home from say

Tis Sunderland John Squire to the song and not Bidevor said his
mate

Well Bidevors so good as Sunderland any day for all theres
no saycoals there blacking a place about and makes just so good
harmonies Tommy Hamblyn

 Oh if I was a herring to swim the ocean oer
 Or if I was a saydove to fly unto the shoor
 To fly unto my true love a waiting at the door
 To wed her with a goold ring and plough the main no moor

Here Yeo broke in

Arent you ashamed John Squire to your years singing such carnal
vanities after all the providences you have seen Let the songs of Zion
be in your mouth man if you must needs keep a caterwauling all day
like that

You sing em yourself then gunner

Well says Yeo and why not And out he pulled his psalmbook and
began a scrap of the grand old psalm

 Such as in ships and brittle barks
 Into the seas descend
 Their merchandise through fearful floods
 To compass and to end
 There men are forced to behold
 The Lords works what they be
 And in the dreadful deep the same
 Most marvellous they see

Humph said John Squire Very good and godly but still I du like
a merry catch now and then I du Wouldnt you let a body sing
Rumbeloweven when hes heaving of the anchor

Well I dont know said Yeo but the Lords people had better
praise the Lord then too and pray for a good voyage instead of howling
about

 A randy dandy dandy O
 A whet of ale and brandy O
 With a rumbelow and a Westwardho
 And heave my mariners all O

Is that fit talk for immortal souls How does that childstrade sound
beside the Psalms John Squire

Now it befell that Salvation Yeo for the very purpose of holding up to
ridicule that timehonored melody had put into it the true nasal twang
and rung it out as merrily as he had done perhaps twelve years before
when he got up John Oxenhams anchor in Plymouth Sound And it befell
also that Ayacanora as she stood by Amyass side watching the men and
trying to make out their chat heard it and started and then half to
herself took up the strain and sang it over again word for word in
the very same tune and tone

Salvation Yeo started in his turn and turned deadly pale

Who sung that he asked quickly

The little maid here Shes coming on nicely in her English said
Amyas

The little maid said Yeo turning paler still Why do you go about
to scare an old servant by talking of little maids Captain Amyas
Well he said aloud to himself as I am a sinful saint if I hadnt
seen where the voice came from I could have sworn it was her just as
we taught her to sing it by the river there I and William Penberthy of
Marazion my good comrade The Lord have mercy on me

All were silent as the grave whenever Yeo made any allusion to that lost
child Ayacanora only pleased with Amyass commendation went humming
on to herself

 And heave my mariners all O

Yeo started up from the gun where he sat

I cant abear it As I live I cant You Indian maiden where did you
learn to sing that there

Ayacanora looked up at him half frightened by his vehemence then at
Amyas to see if she had been doing anything wrong and then turned
saucily away looked over the side and hummed on

Ask her for mercys sakeask her Captain Leigh

My child said Amyas speaking in Indian how is it you sing that so
much better than any other English Did you ever hear it before

Ayacanora looked up at him puzzled and shook her head and then

If you tell Indian to Ayacanora she dumb She must be English girl
now like poor Lucy

Well then said Amyas do you recollect Ayacanorado you
recollectwhat shall I say anything that happened when you were a
little girl

She paused awhile and then moving her hands overhead

Treesgreat trees like the Magdalenaalways nothing but treeswild
and bad everything Ayacanora wont talk about that

Do you mind anything that grew on those trees asked Yeo eagerly

She laughed Silly Flowers and fruit and nutsgrow on all trees and
monkeycups too Ayacanora climbed up after themwhen she was wild I
wont tell any more

But who taught you to call them monkeycups asked Yeo trembling with
excitement

Monkeys drink mono drink

Mono said Yeo foiled on one cast and now trying another How did
you know the beasts were called monos

She might have heard it coming down with us said Cary who had joined
the group

Ay monos said she in a selfjustifying tone Faces like little
men and tails And one very dirty black one with a beard say Amen in
a tree to all the other monkeys just like Sir John on Sunday

This allusion to Brimblecombe and the preaching apes upset all but old
Yeo

But dont you recollect any Christianswhite people

She was silent

Dont you mind a white lady

Um

A woman a very pretty woman with hair like his pointing to Amyas

No

What do you mind then beside those Indians added Yeo in despair

She turned her back on him peevishly as if tired with the efforts of
her memory

Do try to remember said Amyas and she set to work again at once

Ayacanora mind great monkeysblack oh so high and she held up her
hand above her head and made a violent gesture of disgust

Monkeys what with tails

No like man Ah yesjust like Cooky theredirty Cooky

And that hapless son of Ham who happened to be just crossing the
maindeck heard a marlingspike which by ill luck was lying at hand
flying past his ears

Ayacanora if you heave any more things at Cooky I must have you
whipped said Amyas without of course any such intention

Ill kill you then answered she in the most matteroffact tone

She must mean negurs said Yeo I wonder where she saw them now
What if it were they Cimaroons

But why should any one who had seen whites forget them and yet
remember negroes asked Cary

Let us try again Do you mind no great monkeys but those black ones
asked Amyas

Yes she said after a whiledevil

Devil asked all three who of course were by no means free from the
belief that the fiend did actually appear to the Indian conjurors such
as had brought up the girl

Ay him Sir John tell about on Sundays

Save and help us said Yeo and what was he like unto

She made various signs to intimate that he had a monkeys face and
a gray beard like Yeos So far so good but now came a series of
manipulations about her pretty little neck which set all their fancies
at fault

I know said Cary at last bursting into a great laugh Sir Urian
had a ruff on as I live Trunkhose too my fair dame StopIll make
sure Was his neck like the senor commandants the Spaniard

Ayacanora clapped her hands at finding herself understood and the
questioning went on

The devil appeared like a monkey with a gray beard in a
ruffhumph

Ay said she in good enough Spanish Mono de Panama viejo diablo de
Panama

Yeo threw up his hands with a shriekOh Lord of all mercies Those
were the last words of Mr John Oxenham Ayand the devil is surely
none other than the devil Don Francisco Xararte Oh dear oh dear oh
dear my sweet young lady my pretty little maid and dont you know me
Dont you know Salvation Yeo that carried you over the mountains
and used to climb for the monkeycups for you my dear young lady And
William Penberthy too that used to get you flowers and your poor dear
father that was just like Mr Cary there only he had a black beard
and black curls and swore terribly in his speech like a Spaniard my
dear young lady

And the honest fellow falling on his knees covered Ayacanoras hands
with kisses while all the crew fancying him gone suddenly mad crowded
aft

Steady men and dont vex him said Amyas He thinks that he has
found his little maid at last

And so do I Amyas as I live said Cary

Steady steady my masters all If this turn out a wrong scent after
all his wits will crack Mr Yeo cant you think of any other token

Yeo stamped impatiently What need then its her I tell ye and
thats enough What a beauty shes grown Oh dear where were my eyes
all this time to behold her and not to see her Tis her very mortal
self it is And dont you mind me my dear now Dont you mind
Salvation Yeo that taught you to sing Heave my mariners all O
asitting on a log by the boat upon the sand and there was a sight of
red lilies grew on it in the moss dear now wasnt there and we made
posies of them to put in your hair nowAnd the poor old man ran on
in a supplicating suggestive tone as if he could persuade the girl
into becoming the person whom he sought

Ayacanora had watched him first angry then amused then attentive and
at last with the most intense earnestness Suddenly she grew crimson
and snatching her hands from the old mans hid her face in them and
stood

Do you remember anything of all this my child asked Amyas gently

She lifted up her eyes suddenly to his with a look of imploring agony
as if beseeching him to spare her The death of a whole old life
the birth of a whole new life was struggling in that beautiful face
choking in that magnificent throat as she threw back her small head
and drew in her breath and dashed her locks back from her temples as
if seeking for fresh air She shuddered reeled then fell weeping on
the bosom not of Salvation Yeo but of Amyas Leigh

He stood still a minute or two bearing that fair burden ere he could
recollect himself Then

Ayacanora you are not yet mistress of yourself my child You were
better to go down and see after poor Lucy and we will talk about it
all tomorrow

She gathered herself up instantly and with eyes fixed on the deck slid
through the group and disappeared below

Ah said Yeo with a tone of exquisite sadness the young to the
young Over land and sea in the forests and in the galleys in battle
and prison I have sought her And now

My good friend said Amyas neither are you master of yourself yet
When she comes round again whom will she love and thank but you

You sir She owes all to you and so do I Let me go below sir My
old wits are shaky Bless you sir and thank you for ever and ever

And Yeo grasped Amyass hand and went down to his cabin from which he
did not reappear for many hours

From that day Ayacanora was a new creature The thought that she was
an Englishwoman that she the wild Indian was really one of the
great white people whom she had learned to worship carried in it some
regenerating change she regained all her former stateliness and with
it a selfrestraint a temperance a softness which she had never shown
before Her dislike to Cary and Jack vanished Modest and distant as
ever she now took delight in learning from them about England and
English people and her knowledge of our customs gained much from the
somewhat fantastic behaviour which Amyas thought good for reasons
of his own to assume toward her He assigned her a handsome cabin to
herself always addressed her as madam and told Cary Brimblecombe and
the whole crew that as she was a lady and a Christian he expected them
to behave to her as such So there was as much bowing and scraping
on the poop as if it had been a princes court and Ayacanora though
sorely puzzled and chagrined at Amyass new solemnity contrived to
imitate it pretty well taking for granted that it was the right thing
and having tolerable masters in the art of manners for both Amyas and
Cary were thoroughly wellbred men profited much in all things except
in intimacy with Amyas who had cunning fellow hit on this parade of
good manners as a fresh means of increasing the distance between him
and her The crew of course though they were a little vexed at losing
their pet consoled themselves with the thought that she was a real
born lady and Mr Oxenhams daughter too and there was not a man on
board who did not prick up his ears for a message if she approached him
or one who would not have I verily believe jumped overboard to do her
a pleasure

Only Yeo kept sorrowfully apart He never looked at her spoke to her
met her even if he could His dream had vanished He had found her and
after all she did not care for him Why should she

But it was hard to have hunted a bubble for years and have it break
in his hand at last Set not your affections on things on the earth
murmured Yeo to himself as he pored over his Bible in the vain hope of
forgetting his little maid

But why did Amyas wish to increase the distance between himself and
Ayacanora Many reasons might be given I deny none of them But the
main one fantastic as it may seem was simply that while she had
discovered herself to be an Englishwoman he had discovered her to be a
Spaniard If her father were seven times John Oxenham and even that the
perverse fellow was inclined to doubt her mother was a SpaniardPah
one of the accursed race kinswomanperhaps to his brothers
murderers His jaundiced eyes could see nothing but the Spanish element
in her or indeed in anything else As Cary said to him once using a
cant phrase of Sidneys which he had picked up from Frank all heaven
and earth were spaniolated to him He seemed to recollect nothing but
that Heaven had made Spaniards to be killed and him to kill them If
he had not been the most sensible of John Bulls he would certainly have
forestalled the monomania of that young Frenchman of rank who some
eighty years after him so maddened his brain by reading of the Spanish
cruelties that he threw up all his prospects and turned captain of
filibusters in the West Indies for the express purpose of ridding them
of their tyrants and when a Spanish ship was taken used to relinquish
the whole booty to his crew and reserve for himself only the pleasure
of witnessing his victims dying agonies

But what had become of that birdlike song of Ayacanoras which had
astonished them on the banks of the Meta and cheered them many a time
in their anxious voyage down the Magdalena From the moment that she
found out her English parentage it stopped She refused utterly to sing
anything but the songs and psalms which she picked up from the English
Whether it was that she despised it as a relic of her barbarism or
whether it was too maddening for one whose heart grew heavier and
humbler day by day the nightingale notes were heard no more

So homeward they ran before a favoring southwest breeze but long
ere they were within sight of land Lucy Passmore was gone to her rest
beneath the Atlantic waves



CHAPTER XXVIII

HOW AMYAS CAME HOME THE THIRD TIME

 It fell about the Martinmas
 When nights were lang and mirk
 That wifes twa sons cam hame again
 And their hats were o the birk

 It did na graw by bush or brae
 Nor yet in ony shough
 But by the gates o paradise
 That birk grew fair eneugh

 The Wife of Ushers Well

It is the evening of the 15th of February 1587 and Mrs Leigh for
we must return now to old scenes and old faces is pacing slowly up and
down the terracewalk at Burrough looking out over the winding river
and the hazy sandhills and the wide western sea as she has done every
evening be it fair weather or foul for three weary years Three years
and more are past and gone and yet no news of Frank and Amyas and
the gallant ship and all the gallant souls therein and loving eyes in
Bideford and Appledore Clovelly and Ilfracombe have grown hollow with
watching and with weeping for those who have sailed away into the West
as John Oxenham sailed before them and have vanished like a dream as
he did into the infinite unknown Three weary years and yet no word
Once there was a flush of hope and good Sir Richard without Mrs
Leighs knowledge had sent a horseman posting across to Plymouth when
the news arrived that Drake Frobisher and Carlisle had returned with
their squadron from the Spanish Main Alas he brought back great news
glorious news news of the sacking of Cartagena San Domingo Saint
Augustine of the relief of Raleighs Virginian Colony but no news of
the Rose and of those who had sailed in her And Mrs Leigh bowed her
head and worshipped and said The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken
away blessed be the name of the Lord

Her hair was now grown gray her cheeks were wan her step was feeble
She seldom went from home save to the church and to the neighboring
cottages She never mentioned her sons names never allowed a word to
pass her lips which might betoken that she thought of them but every
day when the tide was high and red flag on the sandhills showed that
there was water over the bar she paced the terracewalk and devoured
with greedy eyes the sea beyond in search of the sail which never came
The stately ships went in and out as of yore and white sails hung off
the bar for many an hour day after day month after month year after
year but an instinct within told her that none of them were the sails
she sought She knew that ship every line of her the cut of every
cloth she could have picked it out miles away among a whole fleet but
it never came and Mrs Leigh bowed her head and worshipped and went
to and fro among the poor who looked on her as an awful being and one
whom God had brought very near to Himself in that mysterious heaven of
sorrow which they too knew full well And lone women and bedridden men
looked in her steadfast eyes and loved them and drank in strength from
them for they knew though she never spoke of her own grief that she
had gone down into the fiercest depths of the fiery furnace and was
walking there unhurt by the side of One whose form was as of the Son
of God And all the while she was blaming herself for her earthly
longings and confessing nightly to Heaven that weakness which she could
not shake off which drew her feet at each high tide to the terracewalk
beneath the row of windclipt trees

But this evening Northam is in a stir The pebble ridge is thundering
far below as it thundered years ago but Northam is noisy enough
without the rolling of the surge The tower is rocking with the pealing
bells the people are all in the streets shouting and singing round
bonfires They are burning the pope in effigy drinking to the queens
health and So perish all her enemies The hills are red with bonfires
in every village and far away the bells of Bideford are answering
the bells of Northam as they answered them seven years ago when Amyas
returned from sailing round the world For this day has come the news
that Mary Queen of Scots is beheaded in Fotheringay and all England
like a dreamer who shakes off some hideous nightmare has leapt up in
one tremendous shout of jubilation as the terror and the danger of
seventeen anxious years is lifted from its heart for ever

Yes she is gone to answer at a higher tribunal than that of the
Estates of England for all the noble English blood which has been
poured out for her for all the noble English hearts whom she has
tempted into treachery rebellion and murder Elizabeths own words
have been fulfilled at last after years of longsuffering

 The daughter of debate
 That discord aye doth sow
 Hath reapd no gain where former rule
 Hath taught still peace to grow

And now she can do evil no more Murder and adultery the heart which
knew no forgiveness the tongue which could not speak truth even for its
own interest have past and are perhaps atoned for and her fair face
hangs a pitiful dream in the memory even of those who knew that either
she or England must perish

 Nothing is left of her
 Now but pure womanly

And Mrs Leigh Protestant as she is breathes a prayer that the Lord
may have mercy on that soul as clear as diamond and as hard as she
said of herself That last scene too before the fatal blockit could
not be altogether acting Mrs Leigh had learned many a priceless lesson
in the last seven years might not Mary Stuart have learned something
in seventeen And Mrs Leigh had been a courtier and knew as far as a
chaste Englishwoman could know which even in those coarser days was not
very much of that godless style of French court profligacy in which
poor Mary had had her youthful training amid the Medicis and the
Guises and Cardinal Lorraine and she shuddered and sighed to
herselfTo whom little is given of them shall little be required
But still the bells pealed on and would not cease

What was that which answered them from afar out of the fast darkening
twilight A flash and then the thunder of a gun at sea

Mrs Leigh stopped The flash was right outside the bar A ship in
distress it could not be The wind was light and westerly It was a
high springtide as evening floods are always there What could it be
Another flash another gun The noisy folks of Northam were hushed at
once and all hurried into the churchyard which looks down on the broad
flats and the river

There was a gallant ship outside the bar She was running in too with
all sails set A large ship nearly a thousand tons she might be but
not of English rig What was the meaning of it A Spanish cruiser about
to make reprisals for Drakes raid along the Cadiz shore Not that
surely The Don had no fancy for such unscientific and daredevil
warfare If he came he would come with admiral rearadmiral and
viceadmiral transports and avisos according to the bestapproved
methods articles and science of war What could she be

Easily on the flowing tide and fair western wind she has slipped
up the channel between the two lines of sandhill She is almost off
Appledore now She is no enemy and if she be a foreigner she is a
daring one for she has never veiled her topsailsand that all know
every foreign ship must do within sight of an English port or stand the
chance of war as the Spanish admiral found who many a year since
was sent in time of peace to fetch home from Flanders Anne of Austria
Philip the Seconds last wife

For in his pride he sailed into Plymouth Sound without veiling topsails
or lowering the flag of Spain Whereon like lion from his den out
rushed John Hawkins the port admiral in his famous Jesus of Lubec
afterwards lost in the San Juan dUlloa fight and without argument or
parley sent a shot between the admirals masts which not producing the
desired effect alongside ran bold Captain John and with his next
shot so says his son an eyewitness lackt the admiral through and
through whereon down came the offending flag and due apologies were
made but not accepted for a long time by the stout guardian of her
majestys honor And if John Hawkins did as much for a Spanish fleet in
time of peace there is more than one old seadog in Appledore who will
do as much for a single ship in time of war if he can find even an iron
pot to burn powder withal

The strange sail passed out of sight behind the hill of Appledore and
then there rose into the quiet evening air a cheer as from a hundred
throats Mrs Leigh stood still and listened Another gun thundered
among the hills and then another cheer

It might have been twenty minutes before the vessel hove in sight again
round the dark rocks of the Hubbastone as she turned up the Bideford
river Mrs Leigh had stood that whole time perfectly motionless a pale
and scarcely breathing statue her eyes fixed upon the Vikings rock

Round the Hubbastone she came at last There was music on board drums
and fifes shawms and trumpets which wakened ringing echoes from every
knoll of wood and slab of slate And as she opened full on Burrough
House another cheer burst from her crew and rolled up to the hills
from off the silver waters far below full a mile away

Mrs Leigh walked quickly toward the house and called her maid

Grace bring me my hood Master Amyas is come home

No surely O joyful sound Praised and blessed be the Lord then
praised and blessed be the Lord But madam however did you know that

I heard his voice on the river but I did not hear Mr Franks with
him Grace

Oh be sure madam where the one is the other is Theyd never part
company Both come home or neither Ill warrant Heres your hood
madam

And Mrs Leigh with Grace behind her started with rapid steps towards
Bideford

Was it true Was it a dream Had the divine instinct of the mother
enabled her to recognize her childs voice among all the rest and at
that enormous distance or was her brain turning with the long effort of
her supernatural calm

Grace asked herself in her own way that same question many a time
between Burrough and Bideford When they arrived on the quay the
question answered itself

As they came down Bridgeland Street where afterwards the tobacco
warehouses for the Virginia trade used to stand but which then was but
a row of ropewalks and sailmakers shops they could see the strange
ship already at anchor in the river They had just reached the lower end
of the street when round the corner swept a great mob sailors women
prentices hurrahing questioning weeping laughing Mrs Leigh
stopped and behold they stopped also

Here she is shouted some one heres his mother

His mother Not their mother said Mrs Leigh to herself and turned
very pale but that heart was long past breaking

The next moment the giant head and shoulders of Amyas far above the
crowd swept round the corner

Make a way Make room for Madam LeighAnd Amyas fell on his knees at
her feet

She threw her arms round his neck and bent her fair head over his
while sailors prentices and coarse harborwomen were hushed into holy
silence and made a ring round the mother and the son

Mrs Leigh asked no question She saw that Amyas was alone

At last he whispered I would have died to save him mother if I
could

You need not tell me that Amyas Leigh my son

Another silence

How did he die whispered Mrs Leigh

He is a martyr He died in the

Amyas could say no more

The Inquisition

Yes

A strong shudder passed through Mrs Leighs frame and then she lifted
up her head

Come home Amyas I little expected such an honorsuch an honorha
ha and such a fair young martyr too a very St Stephen God have
mercy on me and let me not go mad before these folk when I ought to be
thanking Thee for Thy great mercies Amyas who is that

And she pointed to Ayacanora who stood close behind Amyas watching
with keen eyes the whole

She is a poor wild Indian girlmy daughter I call her I will tell
you her story hereafter

Your daughter My granddaughter then Come hither maiden and be my
granddaughter

Ayacanora came obedient and knelt down because she had seen Amyas
kneel

God forbid child kneel not to me Come home and let me know whether
I am sane or mazed alive or dead

And drawing her hood over her face she turned to go back holding Amyas
tight by one hand and Ayacanora by the other

The crowd let them depart some twenty yards in respectful silence and
then burst into a cheer which made the old town ring

Mrs Leigh stopped suddenly

I had forgotten Amyas You must not let me stand in the way of your
duty Where are your men

Kissed to death by this time all of them that is who are left

Left

We went out a hundred mother and we came home fortyfourif we are
at home Is it a dream mother Is this you and this old Bridgeland
Street again As I live there stands Evans the smith at his door
tankard in hand as he did when I was a boy

The brawny smith came across the street to them but stopped when he saw
Amyas but no Frank

Better one than neither madam said he trying a rough comfort Amyas
shook his hand as he passed him but Mrs Leigh neither heard nor saw
him nor any one

Mother said Amyas when they were now past the causeway we are rich
for life

Yes a martyrs death was the fittest for him

I have brought home treasure untold

What my boy

Treasure untold Cary has promised to see to it tonight

Very well I would that he had slept at our house He was a kindly lad
and loved Frank When did he

Three years ago and more Within two months of our sailing

Ah Yes he told me so

Told you so

Yes the dear lad has often come to see me in my sleep but you never
came I guessed how it wasas it should be

But I loved you none the less mother

I know that too but you were busy with the men you know sweet
so your spirit could not come roving home like his which was free
Yesall as it should be My maid and do you not find it cold here in
England after those hot regions

Ayacanoras heart is warm she does not think about cold

Warm perhaps you will warm my heart for me then

Would God I could do it mother said Amyas half reproachfully

Mrs Leigh looked up in his face and burst into a violent flood of
tears

Sinful sinful that I am

Blessed creature cried Amyas if you speak so I shall go mad
Mother mother I have been dreading this meeting for months It has
been a nightmare hanging over me like a horrible black thundercloud a
great cliff miles high with its top hid in the clouds which I had to
climb and dare not I have longed to leap overboard and flee from it
like a coward into the depths of the seaThe thought that you might
ask me whether I was not my brothers keeperthat you might require his
blood at my handsand now now when it comes to find you all love
and trust and patiencemother mother its more than I can bear and
he wept violently

Mrs Leigh knew enough of Amyas to know that any burst of this kind
from his quiet nature betokened some very fearful struggle and the
loving creature forgot everything instantly in the one desire to soothe
him

And soothe him she did and home the two went arm in arm together
while Ayacanora held fast like a child by the skirt of Mrs Leighs
cloak The selfhelp and daring of the forest nymph had given place to
the trembling modesty of the young girl suddenly cast on shore in a new
world among strange faces strange hopes and strange fears also

Will your mother love me whispered she to Amyas as she went in

Yes but you must do what she tells you

Ayacanora pouted

She will laugh at me because I am wild

She never laughs at any one

Humph said Ayacanora Well I shall not be afraid of her I thought
she would have been tall like you but she is not even as big as me

This hardly sounded hopeful for the prospect of Ayacanoras obedience
but ere twentyfour hours had passed Mrs Leigh had won her over
utterly and she explained her own speech by saying that she thought so
great a man ought to have a great mother She had expected poor thing
in her simplicity some awful princess with a frown like Junos own and
found instead a healing angel

Her story was soon told to Mrs Leigh who of course womanlike
would not allow a doubt as to her identity And the sweet mother never
imprinted a prouder or fonder kiss upon her sons forehead than
that with which she repaid his simple declaration that he had kept
unspotted like a gentleman and a Christian the soul which God had put
into his charge

Then you have forgiven me mother

Years ago I said in this same room what should I render to the Lord
for having given me two such sons And in this room I say it once again
Tell me all about my other son that I may honor him as I honor you

And then with the iron nerve which good women have she made him give
her every detail of Lucy Passmores story and of all which had happened
from the day of their sailing to that luckless night at Guayra And when
it was done she led Ayacanora out and began busying herself about the
girls comforts as calmly as if Frank and Amyas had been sleeping in
their cribs in the next room

But she had hardly gone upstairs when a loud knock at the door was
followed by its opening hastily and into the hall burst regardless of
etiquette the tall and stately figure of Sir Richard Grenville

Amyas dropped on his knees instinctively The stern warrior was quite
unmanned and as he bent over his godson a tear dropped from that iron
cheek upon the iron cheek of Amyas Leigh

My lad my glorious lad and where have you been Get up and tell me
all The sailors told me a little but I must hear every word I knew
you would do something grand I told your mother you were too good a
workman for God to throw away Now let me have the whole story Why I
am out of breath To tell truth I ran threeparts of the way hither

And down the two sat and Amyas talked long into the night while Sir
Richard his usual stateliness recovered smiled stern approval at each
deed of daring and when all was ended answered with something like a
sigh

Would God that I had been with you every step Would God at least
that I could show as good a threeyears logbook Amyas my lad

You can show a better one I doubt not

Humph With the exception of one paltry Spanish prize I dont know
that the queen is the better or her enemies the worse for me since we
parted last in Dublin city

You are too modest sir

Would that I were but I got on in Ireland I found no better than my
neighbors and so came home again to find that while I had been wasting
my time in that land of misrule Raleigh had done a deed to which I can
see no end For lad he has found or rather his two captains Amadas
and Barlow have found for him between Florida and Newfoundland a
country the like of which I believe there is not on the earth for
climate and fertility Whether there be gold there I know not and it
matters little for there is all else on earth that man can want furs
timber rivers game sugarcanes corn fruit and every commodity
which France Spain or Italy can yield wild in abundance the savages
civil enough for savages and in a word all which goes to the making
of as noble a jewel as her majestys crown can wear The people call it
Wingandacoa but we after her majesty Virginia

You have been there then

The year before last lad and left there Ralf Lane Amadas and some
twenty gentlemen and ninety men and moreover some money of my own
and some of old Will Salternes which neither of us will ever see
again For the colony I know not how quarrelled with the Indians I
fear I too was oversharp with some of them for stealingif I was God
forgive me and could not forsooth keep themselves alive for twelve
months so that Drake coming back from his last West Indian voyage
after giving them all the help he could had to bring the whole party
home And if you will believe it the fainthearted fellows had not been
gone a fortnight before I was back again with three ships and all that
they could want And never was I more wroth in my life when all I found
was the ruins of their huts which so rich is the growth there were
already full of great melons and wild deer feeding thereona pretty
sight enough but not what I wanted just then So back I came and being
in no overgood temper vented my humors on the Portugals at the Azores
and had hard fights and small booty So there the matter stands but not
for long for shame it were if such a paradise once found by Britons
should fall into the hands of any but her majesty and we will try again
this spring if men and money can be found Eh lad

But the prize

Ah that was no small makeweight to our disasters after all I
sighted her for six days sail from the American coast but ere we could
lay her aboard it fell dead calm Never a boat had I on boardthey
were all lost in a gale of windand the other ships were becalmed two
leagues astern of me There was no use lying there and pounding her till
she sank so I called the carpenter got up all the old chests and with
them and some spars we floated ourselves alongside and only just in
time For the last of us had hardly scrambled up into the chains when
our crazy Noahs ark went all aboard and sank at the side so that if
we had been minded to run away Amyas we could not whereon judging
valor to be the better part of discretion as I usually do we fell to
with our swords and had her in five minutes and fifty thousand pounds
worth in her which set up my purse again and Raleighs too though I
fear it has run out again since as fast as it ran in

And so ended Sir Richards story

Amyas went the next day to Salterne and told his tale The old man had
heard the outlines of it already but he calmly bade him sit down and
listened to all his chin upon his hand his elbows on his knees His
cheek never blanched his lips never quivered throughout Only when
Amyas came to Roses marriage he heaved a long breath as if a weight
was taken off his heart

Say that again sir

Amyas said it again and then went on faltering he hinted at the
manner of her death

Go on sir Why are you afraid There is nothing to be ashamed of
there is there

Amyas told the whole with downcast eyes and then stole a look at his
hearers face There was no sign of emotion only somewhat of a proud
smile curled the corners of that iron mouth

And her husband asked he after a pause

I am ashamed to have to tell you sir that the man still lives

Still lives sir

Too true as far as I know That it was not my fault my story bears me
witness

Sir I never doubted your will to kill him Still lives you say Well
so do rats and adders And now I suppose Captain Leigh your worship
is minded to recruit yourself on shore a while with the fair lass whom
you have brought home as I hear before having another dash at the
devil and his kin

Do not mention that young ladys name with mine sir she is no more to
me than she is to you for she has Spanish blood in her veins

Salterne smiled grimly

But I am minded at least to do one thing Mr Salterne and that is to
kill Spaniards in fair fight by land and sea wheresoever I shall meet
them And therefore I stay not long here whithersoever I may be bound
next

Well sir when you start come to me for a ship and the best I have
is at your service and if she do not suit command her to be fitted as
you like best and I William Salterne will pay for all which you shall
command to be done

My good sir I have accounts to square with you after a very different
fashion As partadventurer in the Rose I have to deliver to you your
share of the treasure which I have brought home

My share sir If I understood you my ship was lost off the coast of
the Caracas three years agone and this treasure was all won since

True but you as an adventurer in the expedition have a just claim
for your share and will receive it

Captain Leigh you are I see as your father was before you a just
and upright Christian man but sir this money is none of mine for it
was won in no ship of mineHear me sir And if it had been and
that shiphe could not speak her namelay safe and sound now by
Bideford quay do you think sir that William Salterne is the man to
make money out of his daughters sin and sorrow and to handle the price
of blood No sir You went like a gentleman to seek her and like a
gentleman as all the world knows you have done your best and I thank
you but our account ends there The treasure is yours sir I have
enough and more than enough and none God help me to leave it to but
greedy and needy kin who will be rather the worse than the better for
it And if I have a claim in law for aughtwhich I know not neither
shall ever askwhy if you are not too proud accept that claim as a
plain burghers thankoffering to you sir for a great and a noble love
which you and your brother have shown to one who though I say it to my
shame was not worthy thereof

She was worthy of that and more sir For if she sinned like a woman
she died like a saint

Yes sir answered the old man with a proud smile she had the right
English blood in her I doubt not and showed it at the last But now
sir no more of this When you need a ship mine is at your service
till then sir farewell and God be with you

And the old man rose and with an unmoved countenance bowed Amyas
to the door Amyas went back and told Cary bidding him take half of
Salternes gift but Cary swore a great oath that he would have none of
it

Heir of Clovelly Amyas and want to rob you I who have lost
nothingyou who have lost a brother God forbid that I should ever
touch a farthing beyond my original share

That evening a messenger from Bideford came running breathless up to
Burrough Court The authorities wanted Amyass immediate attendance for
he was one of the last it seemed who had seen Mr Salterne alive

Salterne had gone over as soon as Amyas departed to an old
acquaintance signed and sealed his will in their presence with a firm
and cheerful countenance refusing all condolence and then gone home
and locked himself into Roses room Suppertime came and he did not
appear The apprentices could not make him answer and at last called
in the neighbors and forced the door Salterne was kneeling by his
daughters bed his head was upon the coverlet his Prayerbook was
open before him at the Burial Service his hands were clasped in
supplication but he was dead and cold

His will lay by him He had left all his property among his poor
relations saving and excepting all money etc due to him as owner and
partadventurer of the ship Rose and his new bark of three hundred tons
burden now lying Eastthewater all which was bequeathed to Captain
Amyas Leigh on condition that he should rechristen that bark the
Vengeancefit her out with part of the treasure and with her sail
once more against the Spaniard before three years were past

And this was the end of William Salterne merchant



CHAPTER XXIX

HOW THE VIRGINIA FLEET WAS STOPPED BY THE QUEENS COMMAND

 The daughter of debate
 That discord still doth sow
 Shall reap no gain where former rule
 Hath taught still peace to grow
 No foreign banishd wight
 Shall anker in this port
 Our realm it brooks no strangers force
 Let them elsewhere resort

 QU ELIZABETH 1569

And now Amyas is settled quietly at home again and for the next twelve
months little passes worthy of record in these pages Yeo has installed
himself as major domo with no very definite functions save those of
walking about everywhere at Amyass heels like a lank gray wolfhound
and spending his evenings at the fireside as a true old sailor
does with his Bible on his knee and his hands busy in manufacturing
numberless nicknacks useful and useless for every member of the
family and above all for Ayacanora whom he insults every week by
humbly offering some toy only fit for a child at which she pouts and
is reproved by Mrs Leigh and then takes the gift and puts it away
never to look at it again For her whole soul is set upon being
an English maid and she runs about all day long after Mrs Leigh
insisting upon learning the mysteries of the kitchen and the stillroom
and above all the art of making clothes for herself and at last for
everybody in Northam For first she will be a good housewife like Mrs
Leigh and next a new idea has dawned on her that of helping others
To the boundless hospitality of the savage she has been of course
accustomed but to give to those who can give nothing in return is a
new thought She sees Mrs Leigh spending every spare hour in working
for the poor and visiting them in their cottages She sees Amyas after
public thanks in church for his safe return giving away money food
what not in Northam Appledore and Bideford buying cottages and
making them almshouses for wornout mariners and she is told that
this is his thankoffering to God She is puzzled her notion of
a thankoffering was rather that of the Indians and indeed of the
Spaniardssacrifices of human victims and the bedizenment of the
Great Spirits sanctuary with their skulls and bones Not that Amyas
as a plain oldfashioned churchman was unmindful of the good old
instinctive rule that something should be given to the Church itself
for the vicar of Northam was soon resplendent with a new surplice and
what was more the altar with a splendid flagon and salver of plate
lost I suppose in the civil wars which had been taken in the great
galleon Ayacanora could understand that but the almsgiving she could
not till Mrs Leigh told her in her simple way that whosoever gave
to the poor gave to the Great Spirit for the Great Spirit was in them
and in Ayacanora too if she would be quiet and listen to him instead
of pouting and stamping and doing nothing but what she liked And the
poor child took in that new thought like a child and worked her fingers
to the bone for all the old dames in Northam and went about with Mrs
Leigh lovely and beloved and looked now and then out from under her
long black eyelashes to see if she was winning a smile from Amyas And
on the day on which she won one she was good all day and on the day on
which she did not she was thoroughly naughty and would have worn out
the patience of any soul less chastened than Mrs Leighs But as for
the pomp and glory of her dress there was no keeping it within bounds
and she swept into church each Sunday bedizened in Spanish finery with
such a blaze and rustle that the good vicar had to remonstrate humbly
with Mrs Leigh on the disturbance which she caused to the eyes and
thoughts of all his congregation To which Ayacanora answered that she
was not thinking about them and they need not think about her and that
if the Piache in plain English the conjuror as she supposed wanted
a present he might have all her Mexican featherdresses she would
not wear themthey were wild Indian things and she was an English
maidbut they would just do for a Piache and so darted upstairs
brought them down and insisted so stoutly on arraying the vicar
therein that the good man beat a swift retreat But he carried off
with him nevertheless one of the handsomest mantles which instead
of selling it he converted cleverly enough into an altarcloth and for
several years afterwards the communion at Northam was celebrated upon a
blaze of emerald azure and crimson which had once adorned the sinful
body of some Aztec prince

So Ayacanora flaunted on while Amyas watched her half amused half in
simple pride of her beauty and looked around at all gazers as much as
to say See what a fine bird I have brought home

Another great trouble which she gave Mrs Leigh was her conduct to the
ladies of the neighborhood They came of course one and all not only
to congratulate Mrs Leigh but to get a peep at the fair savage but
the fair savage snubbed them all round from the vicars wife to Lady
Grenville herself so effectually that few attempted a second visit

Mrs Leigh remonstrated and was answered by floods of tears They only
come to stare at a poor wild Indian girl and she would not be made a
show of She was like a queen once and every one obeyed her but here
every one looked down upon her But when Mrs Leigh asked her whether
she would sooner go back to the forests the poor girl clung to her like
a baby and entreated not to be sent away She would sooner be a slave
in the kitchen here than go back to the bad people

And so on month after month of foolish storm and foolish sunshine but
she was under the shadow of one in whom was neither storm nor sunshine
but a perpetual genial calm of soft gray weather which tempered down
to its own peacefulness all who entered its charmed influence and the
outbursts grew more and more rare and Ayacanora more and more rational
though no more happy day by day

And one by one small hints came out which made her identity certain at
least in the eyes of Mrs Leigh and Yeo After she had become familiar
with the sight of houses she gave them to understand that she had seen
such things before The red cattle too seemed not unknown to her
the sheep puzzled her for some time and at last she gave Mrs Leigh to
understand that they were too small

Ah madam quoth Yeo who caught at every straw it is because she
has been accustomed to those great camel sheep llamas they call them
in Peru

But Ayacanoras delight was a horse The use of tame animals at all was
a daily wonder to her but that a horse could be ridden was the crowning
miracle of all and a horse she would ride and after plaguing Amyas for
one in vain for he did not want to break her pretty neck she proposed
confidentially to Yeo to steal one and foiled in that went to the
vicar and offered to barter all her finery for his brokenkneed pony
But the vicar was too honest to drive so good a bargain and the matter
ended in Amyas buying her a jennet which she learned in a fortnight to
ride like a very Gaucho

And now awoke another curious slumbering reminiscence For one day at
Lady Grenvilles invitation the whole family went over to Stow Mrs
Leigh soberly on a pillion behind the groom Ayacanora cantering round
and round upon the moors like a hound let loose and trying to make
Amyas ride races with her But that night sleeping in the same room
with Mrs Leigh she awoke shrieking and sobbed out a long story how
the Old ape of Panama her especial abomination had come to her
bedside and dragged her forth into the courtyard and how she had
mounted a horse and ridden with an Indian over great moors and high
mountains down into a dark wood and there the Indian and the horses
vanished and she found herself suddenly changed once more into a
little savage child So strong was the impression that she could not be
persuaded that the thing had not happened if not that night at least
some night or other So Mrs Leigh at last believed the same and told
the company next morning in her pious way how the Lord had revealed in
a vision to the poor child who she was and how she had been exposed in
the forests by her jealous stepfather and neither Sir Richard nor his
wife could doubt but that hers was the true solution It was probable
that Don Xararte though his home was Panama had been often at Quito
for Yeo had seen him come on board the Lima ship at Guayaquil one
of the nearest ports This would explain her having been found by the
Indians beyond Cotopaxi the nearest peak of the Eastern Andes if as
was but too likely the old man believing her to be Oxenhams child
had conceived the fearful vengeance of exposing her in the forests

Other little facts came to light one by one They were all connected
as was natural in a savage with some animal or other natural object
Whatever impressions her morals or affections had received had been
erased by the long spiritual death of that forest sojourn and Mrs
Leigh could not elicit from her a trace of feeling about her mother or
recollection of any early religious teaching This link however was
supplied at last and in this way

Sir Richard had brought home an Indian with him from Virginia Of his
original name I am not sure but he was probably the Wanchese whose
name occurs with that of Manteo

This man was to be baptized in the church at Bideford by the name of
Raleigh his sponsors being most probably Raleigh himself who may have
been there on Virginian business and Sir Richard Grenville All the
notabilities of Bideford came of course to see the baptism of the
first Red man whose foot had ever trodden British soil and the mayor
and corporationmen appeared in full robes with maces and tipstaffs to
do honor to that firstfruits of the Gospel in the West

Mrs Leigh went as a matter of course and Ayacanora would needs go
too She was very anxious to know what they were going to do with the
Carib

To make him a Christian

Why did they not make her one

Because she was one already They were sure that she had been christened
as soon as she was born But she was not sure and pouted a good deal
at the chance of an ugly red Carib being better off than she was
However all assembled duly the stately son of the forest now
transformed into a footman of Sir Richards was standing at the font
the service was half performed when a heavy sigh or rather groan made
all eyes turn and Ayacanora sank fainting upon Mrs Leighs bosom

She was carried out and to a neighboring house and when she came to
herself told a strange story How as she was standing there trying to
recollect whether she too had ever been baptized the church seemed
to grow larger the priests dress richer the walls were covered with
pictures and above the altar in jewelled robes stood a lady and in
her arms a babe Soft music sounded in her ears the air was full on
that she insisted much of fragrant odor which filled the church like
mist and through it she saw not one but many Indians standing by the
font and a lady held her by the hand and she was a little girl again

And after many questionings so accurate was her recollection not only
of the scene but of the building that Yeo pronounced

A christened woman she is madam if Popish christening is worth
calling such and has seen Indians christened too in the Cathedral
Church at Quito the inside whereof I know well enough and too well
for I sat there three mortal hours in a San Benito to hear a friar
preach his false doctrines not knowing whether I was to be burnt or not
next day

So Ayacanora went home to Burrough and Raleigh the Indian to
Sir Richards house The entry of his baptism still stands
crookedlettered in the old parchment register of the Bideford baptisms
for 15873

 Raleigh a Winganditoian March 26

His name occurs once more a year and a month after

 Rawly a Winganditoian April 1589

But it is not this time among the baptisms The free forest wanderer has
pined in vain for his old deerhunts amid the fragrant cedar woods
and lazy paddlings through the still lagoons where waterlilies sleep
beneath the shade of great magnolias wreathed with clustered vines and
now he is away to happier huntinggrounds and all that is left of
him below sleeps in the narrow town churchyard blocked in with dingy
houses whose tenants will never waste a sigh upon the Indians grave
There the two entries stand unto this day and most pathetic they have
seemed to me a sort of emblem and firstfruits of the sad fate of that
wornout Red race to whom civilization came too late to save but not
too late to hasten their decay

But though Amyas lay idle England did not That spring saw another and
a larger colony sent out by Raleigh to Virginia under the charge of one
John White Raleigh had written more than once entreating Amyas to take
the command which if he had done perhaps the United States had begun
to exist twenty years sooner than they actually did But his mother had
bound him by a solemn promise and who can wonder at her for asking or
at him for giving it to wait at home with her twelve months at least
So instead of himself he sent five hundred pounds which I suppose
are in Virginia virtually at least until this day for they never came
back again to him

But soon came a sharper trial of Amyass promise to his mother and
one which made him for the first time in his life moody peevish and
restless at the thought that others were fighting Spaniards while
he was sitting idle at home For his whole soul was filling fast with
sullen malice against Don Guzman He was losing the single eye and
his whole body was no longer full of light He had entered into the
darkness in which every man walks who hates his brother and it lay upon
him like a black shadow day and night No company too could be more
fit to darken that shadow than Salvation Yeos The old man grew more
stern in his fanaticism day by day and found a too willing listener in
his master and Mrs Leigh was perhaps for the first and last time
in her life seriously angry when she heard the two coolly debating
whether they had not committed a grievous sin in not killing the Spanish
prisoners on board the galleon

It must be said however as the plain facts set down in this book
testify that if such was the temper of Englishmen at that day
the Spaniards had done a good deal to provoke it and were just then
attempting to do still more

For now we are approaching the year 1588 which an astronomer of
Konigsberg above a hundred years before foretold would be an admirable
year and the German chronologers presaged would be the climacterical
year of the world

The prophecies may stand for what they are worth but they were at least
fulfilled That year was indeed the climacterical year of the world
and decided once and for all the fortunes of the European nations and
of the whole continent of America

No wonder then if as has happened in each great crisis of the human
race some awful instinct that The Day of the Lord was at hand some dim
feeling that there was war in heaven and that the fiends of darkness
and the angels of light were arrayed against each other in some mighty
struggle for the possession of the souls of men should have tried
to express itself in astrologic dreams and as was the fashion then
attributed to the rulers of the planetary houses some sympathy with
the coming worldtragedy

But for the wise there needed no conjunction of planets to tell them
that the day was near at hand when the long desultory duel between
Spain and England would end once and for all in some great
deathgrapple The war as yet had been confined to the Netherlands to
the West Indies and the coasts and isles of Africa to the quarters
in fact where Spain was held either to have no rights or to have
forfeited them by tyranny But Spain itself had been respected by
England as England had by Spain and trade to Spanish ports went on as
usual till in the year 1585 the Spaniard without warning laid an
embargo on all English ships coming to his European shores They were to
be seized it seemed to form part of an enormous armament which was to
attack and crush once and for allwhom The rebellious Netherlanders
said the Spaniards but the queen the ministry and when it was just
not too late the people of England thought otherwise England was the
destined victim so instead of negotiating in order to avoid fighting
they fought in order to produce negotiation Drake Frobisher and
Carlisle as we have seen swept the Spanish Main with fire and sword
stopping the Indian supplies while Walsingham craftiest and yet most
honest of mortals prevented by some mysterious financial operation
the Venetian merchants from repairing the Spaniards loss by a loan and
no Armada came that year

In the meanwhile the Jesuits here and abroad made no secret among
their own dupes of the real objects of the Spanish armament The
impious hereticsthe Drakes and Raleighs Grenvilles and Cavendishes
Hawkinses and Frobishers who had dared to violate that hidden sanctuary
of just half the globe which the pope had bestowed on the defender of
the true faitha shameful ruin a terrible death awaited them when
their sacrilegious barks should sink beneath the thunder of Spanish
cannon blessed by the pope and sanctified with holy water and prayer
to the service of God and his Mother Yes they would fall and
England with them The proud islanders who had dared to rebel against
St Peter and to cast off the worship of Mary should bow their
necks once more under the yoke of the Gospel Their socalled queen
illegitimate excommunicate contumacious the abettor of freetrade
the defender of the Netherlands the pillar of false doctrine throughout
Europe should be sent in chains across the Alps to sue for her life at
the feet of the injured and longsuffering father of mankind while
his nominee took her place upon the throne which she had long since
forfeited by her heresy

What nobler work How could the Church of God be more gloriously
propagated How could higher merit be obtained by faithful Catholics
It must succeed Spain was invincible in valor inexhaustible in wealth
Heaven itself offered them an opportunity They had nothing now to fear
from the Turk for they had concluded a truce with him nothing from the
French for they were embroiled in civil war The heavens themselves
had called upon Spain to fulfil her heavenly mission and restore to
the Churchs crown this brightest and richest of her lost jewels The
heavens themselves called to a new crusade The saints whose altars
the English had rifled and profaned called them to a new crusade The
Virgin Queen of Heaven whose boundless stores of grace the English
spurned called them to a new crusade Justly incensed at her own wrongs
and indignities that evergracious Virgin refuge of sinners and
mother of fair love and holy hope adjured by their knightly honor all
valiant cavaliers to do battle in her cause against the impious harlot
who assumed her titles received from her idolatrous flatterers the
homage due to Mary alone and even for Father Parsons had asserted it
therefore it must be true had caused her name to be substituted for
that of Mary in the Litanies of the Church Let all who wore within a
manly heart without a manly sword look on the woes of Maryher
shame her tears her blushes her heart pierced through with daily
wounds from heretic tongues and choose between her and Elizabeth

So said Parsons Allen and dozens more and said more than this too
and much which one had rather not repeat and were somewhat surprised
and mortified to find that their hearers though they granted the
premises were too dull or carnal to arrive at the same conclusion The
English lay Romanists almost to a man had hearts sounder than their
heads and howsoever illogically could not help holding to the strange
superstition that being Englishmen they were bound to fight for
England So the hapless Jesuits who had been boasting for years past
that the persecuted faithful throughout the island would rise as one man
to fight under the blessed banner of the pope and Spain found that the
faithful like Demas of old forsook them and went after this present
world having no objection of course to the restoration of Popery
but preferring some more comfortable method than an invasion which would
inevitably rob them of their ancestral lands and would seat needy and
greedy Castilians in their old country houses to treat their tenants as
they had treated the Indians of Hispaniola and them as they had treated
the caciques

But though the hearts of men in that ungodly age were too hard to melt
at the supposed woes of the Mary who reigned above and too dull to turn
rebels and traitors for the sake of those thrones and principalities in
supralunar spheres which might be in her gift yet there was a Mary
who reigned or ought to reign below whose woes like her gifts were
somewhat more palpable to the carnal sense A Mary who having every
comfort and luxury including hounds and horses found for her by the
English Government at an expense which would be now equal to some
twenty thousand a year could afford to employ the whole of her jointure
as Queen Dowager of France probably equal to fifty thousand a year
more in plotting the destruction of the said government and the
murder of its queen a Mary who if she prospered as she ought might
have dukedoms and earldoms fair lands and castles to bestow on her
faithful servants a Mary finally who contrived by means of an angel
face a serpent tongue and a heart as she said herself as hard as
a diamond to make every weak man fall in love with her and what was
worse fancy more or less that she was in love with him

Of her the Jesuits were not unmindful and found it convenient indeed
to forget awhile the sorrows of the Queen of Heaven in those of the
Queen of Scots Not that they cared much for those sorrows but they
were an excellent stockintrade She was a Romanist she was beautiful
and unfortunate a virtue which like charity hides the multitude of
sins and therefore she was a convenient card to play in the great game
of Rome against the Queen and people of England and played the poor
card was till it got torn up by overusing Into her merits or demerits
I do not enter deeply here Let her rest in peace

To all which the people of England made a most practical and terrible
answer From the highest noble to the lowest peasant arose one
simultaneous plebiscitum We are tired of these seventeen years of
chicanery and terror This woman must die or the commonweal of England
perish We all know which of the two alternatives was chosen

All Europe stood aghast but rather with astonishment at English
audacity than with horror at English wickedness Marys own French
kinsfolk had openly given her up as too bad to be excused much less
assisted Her own son blustered a little to the English ambassador
for the majesty of kings was invaded whereon Walsingham said in open
council that the queen should send him a couple of hounds and that
would set all right Which sage advice being acted on and some deer
sent over and above was so successful that the pious mourner having
run off Randolph says like a baby to see the deer in their cart
returned for answer that he would thereafter depend wholly upon her
majesty and serve her fortune against all the world and that he only
wanted now two of her majestys yeoman prickers and a couple of her
grooms of the deer The Spaniard was not sorry on the whole for the
catastrophe for all that had kept him from conquering England long ago
was the fear lest after it was done he might have had to put the crown
thereof on Marys head instead of his own But Marys death was as
convenient a stalkinghorse to him as to the pope and now the Armada
was coming in earnest

Elizabeth began negotiating but fancy not that she does nothing more
as the following letter testifies written about midsummer 1587


F Drake to Captain Amyas Leigh This with haste

DEAR LAD

As I said to her most glorious majesty I say to you now There are two
ways of facing an enemy The one to stand off and cry Try that again
and Ill strike thee the other to strike him first and then Try
that at all and Ill strike thee again Of which latter counsel her
majesty so far approves that I go forthwith tell it not in Gath down
the coast to singe the king of Spains beard so I termed it to her
majesty she laughing in which if I leave so much as a fishingboat
afloat from the Groyne unto Cadiz it will not be with my good will who
intend that if he come this year he shall come by swimming and not by
sailing So if you are still the man I have known you bring a good ship
round to Plymouth within the month and away with me for hard blows and
hard money the feel of both of which you know pretty well by now

Thine lovingly

F Drake


Amyas clutched his locks over this letter and smoked more tobacco the
day he got it than had ever before been consumed at once in England But
he kept true to his promise and this was his reply



Amyas Leigh to the Worshipful Sir F Drake Admiral of her Majestys
Fleet in Plymouth

MOST HONORED SIR

A magician keeps me here in bilboes for which you have no picklock
namely a mother who forbids The loss is mine but Antichrist I can
fight any year for he will not die this bout nor the next while my
motherbut I will not trouble your patience more than to ask from you
to get me news if you can from any prisoners of one Don Guzman Maria
Magdalena Sotomayor de Soto whether he is in Spain or in the Indies
and what the villain does and where he is to be found This only I
entreat of you and so remain behind with a heavy heart

Yours to command in all else and I would to Heaven in this also

AMYAS LEIGH


I am sorry to have to say that after having thus obeyed his mother
Master Amyas as men are too apt to do revenged himself on her by being
more and more cross and disagreeable But his temper amended much
when a few months after Drake returned triumphant having destroyed
a hundred sail in Cadiz alone taken three great galleons with immense
wealth on board burnt the small craft all along the shore and offered
battle to Santa Cruz at the mouth of the Tagus After which it is
unnecessary to say that the Armada was put off for yet another year

This news indeed gave Amyas little comfort for he merely observed
grumbling that Drake had gone and spoiled everybody elses sport but
what cheered him was news from Drake that Don Guzman had been heard of
from the captain of one of the galleons that he was high in favor in
Spain and commandant of soldiers on board one of the largest of the
marquiss ships

And when Amyas heard that a terrible joy took possession of him When
the Armada came as come it would he should meet his enemy at last He
could wait now patiently ifand he shuddered at himself as he found
himself in the very act of breathing a prayer that Don Guzman might not
die before that meeting

In the meanwhile rumor flew thousandtongued through the length and
breadth of the land of vast preparations going on in Spain and Italy
of timber felled long before for some such purpose brought down to the
sea and sawn out for shipbuilding of casting of cannon and drilling
of soldiers of ships in hundreds collecting at Lisbon of a crusade
preached by Pope Sixtus the Fifth who had bestowed the kingdom of
England on the Spaniard to be enjoyed by him as vassal tributary to
Rome of a million of gold to be paid by the pope onehalf down at
once the other half when London was taken of Cardinal Allen writing
and printing busily in the Netherlands calling on all good Englishmen
to carry out by rebelling against Elizabeth the bull of Sixtus the
Fifth said I blush to repeat it to have been dictated by the Holy
Ghost of Inquisitors getting ready fetters and devils engines of all
sorts of princes and noblemen flocking from all quarters gentlemen
selling their private estates to fit out ships how the Prince of
Melito the Marquess of Burgrave Vespasian Gonzaga John Medicis
Amadas of Savoy in short the illegitimate sons of all the southern
princes having no lands of their own were coming to find that
necessary of life in this pleasant little wheatgarden Nay the Duke of
Medina Sidonia had already engaged MountEdgecombe for himself as the
fairest jewel of the south which when good old Sir Richard Edgecombe
heard he observed quietly that in 1555 he had the pleasure of
receiving at his table at one time the admirals of England Spain and
the Netherlands and therefore had experience in entertaining Dons and
made preparations for the visit by filling his cellars with gunpowder
with a view to a housewarming and feudejoie on the occasion But as
old Fuller says The bear was not yet killed and Medina Sidonia might
have catched a great cold had he no other clothes to wear than the skin
thereof

So flew rumor false and true till poor John Bulls wits were wellnigh
turned but to the very last after his lazy fashion he persuaded
himself that it would all come right somehow that it was too great news
to be true that if it was true the expedition was only meant for the
Netherlands and in short sat quietly over his beef and beer for many
a day after the French king had sent him fair warning and the queen
the ministry and the admirals had been assuring him again and again
that he and not the Dutchman was the destined prey of this great
flight of ravenous birds

At last the Spaniard in order that there should be no mistake about the
matter kindly printed a complete bill of the play to be seen still in
Van Meteran for the comfort of all true Catholics and confusion of all
pestilent heretics which document of course the seminary priests used
to enforce the duty of helping the invaders and the certainty of their
success and from their hands it soon passed into those of the devout
ladies who were not very likely to keep it to themselves till John
Bull himself found his daughters buzzing over it with very pale faces
as young ladies well might who had no wish to follow the fate of
the damsels of Antwerp and condescending to run his eye through it
discovered what all the rest of Europe had known for months past that
he was in a very great scrape

Well it was for England then that her Tudor sovereigns had compelled
every man though they kept up no standing army to be a trained
soldier Well it was that Elizabeth even in those dangerous days of
intrigue and rebellion had trusted her people enough not only to leave
them their weapons but what we forsooth in these more free and
liberal days dare not do to teach them how to use them Well it
was that by careful legislation for the comfort and employment of the
masses term then thank God unknown she had both won their hearts
and kept their bodies in fighting order Well it was that acting as
fully as Napoleon did on la carriere ouverte aux talens she had
raised to the highest posts in her councils her army and her navy men
of business who had not been ashamed to buy and sell as merchants and
adventurers Well for England in a word that Elizabeth had pursued
for thirty years a very different course from that which we have been
pursuing for the last thirty with one exception namely the leaving as
much as possible to private enterprise

There we have copied her would to Heaven that we had in some other
matters It is the fashion now to call her a despot but unless every
monarch is to be branded with that epithet whose power is not as
circumscribed as Queen Victorias is now we ought rather to call her
the most popular sovereign obeyed of their own free will by the freest
subjects which England has ever seen confess the Armada fight to have
been as great a moral triumph as it was a political one and now that
our late boasting is a little silenced by Crimean disasters inquire
whether we have not something to learn from those old Tudor times as
to how to choose officials how to train a people and how to defend a
country

To return to the thread of my story

January 15878 had wellnigh run through before Sir Richard Grenville
made his appearance on the streets of Bideford He had been appointed in
November one of the council of war for providing for the safety of the
nation and the West Country had seen nothing of him since But one
morning just before Christmas his stately figure darkened the old
baywindow at Burrough and Amyas rushed out to meet him and bring him
in and ask what news from Court

All good news dear lad and dearer madam The queen shows the spirit
of a very Boadicea or Semiramis ay a very Scythian Tomyris and if she
had the Spaniard before her now would verily for aught I know feast
him as the Scythian queen did Cyrus with Satia te sanguine quod
sitisti

I trust her most merciful spirit is not so changed already said Mrs
Leigh

Well if she would not do it I would and ask pardon afterwards as
Raleigh did about the rascals at Smerwick whom Amyas knows of Mrs
Leigh these are times in which mercy is cruelty Not England alone
but the world the Bible the Gospel itself is at stake and we must do
terrible things lest we suffer more terrible ones

God will take care of world and Bible better than any cruelty of ours
dear Sir Richard

Nay but Mrs Leigh we must help Him to take care of them If those
Smerwick Spaniards had not been

The Spaniard would not have been exasperated into invading us

And we should not have had this chance of crushing him once and for
all but the quarrel is of older standing madam eh Amyas Amyas has
Raleigh written to you of late

Not a word and I wonder why

Well no wonder at that if you knew how he has been laboring The
wonder is whence he got the knowledge wherewith to labor for he never
saw seawork to my remembrance

Never saw a shot fired by sea except ours at Smerwick and that
brush with the Spaniards in 1579 when he sailed for Virginia with Sir
Humphrey and he was a mere crack then

So you consider him as your pupil eh But he learnt enough in the
Netherland wars and in Ireland too if not of the strength of ships
yet still of the weakness of land forces and would you believe it the
man has twisted the whole council round his finger and made them give
up the land defences to the naval ones

Quite right he and wooden walls against stone ones for ever But as
for twisting he would persuade Satan if he got him alone for half an
hour

I wish he would sail for Spain then just now and try the powers of
his tongue said Mrs Leigh

But are we to have the honor really

We are lad There were many in the council who were for disputing the
landing on shore and saidwhich I do not denythat the prentice
boys of London could face the bluest blood in Spain But Raleigh argued
following my Lord Burleigh in that that we differed from the Low
Countries and all other lands in that we had not a castle or town
throughout which would stand a ten days siege and that our ramparts
as he well said were after all only a body of men So he argued as
long as the enemy has power to land where he will prevention rather
than cure is our only hope and that belongs to the office not of an
army but of a fleet So the fleet was agreed on and a fleet we shall
have

Then here is his health the health of a true friend to all bold
mariners and myself in particular But where is he now

Coming here tomorrow as I hopefor he left London with me and so
down by us into Cornwall to drill the trainbands as he is bound
to do being Seneschal of the Duchies and LieutenantGeneral of the
county

Besides Lord Warden of the Stanneries How the man thrives said Mrs
Leigh

How the man deserves to thrive said Amyas but what are we to do

That is the rub I would fain stay and fight the Spaniards

So would I and will

But he has other plans in his head for us

We can make our own plans without his help

Heyday Amyas How long When did he ask you to do a thing yet and you
refuse him

Not often certainly but Spaniards I must fight

Well so must I boy but I have given a sort of promise to him
nevertheless

Not for me too I hope

No he will extract that himself when he comes you must come and sup
tomorrow and talk it over

Be talked over rather What chestnut does the cat want us monkeys to
pull out of the fire for him now I wonder

Sir Richard Grenville is hardly accustomed to be called a monkey said
Mrs Leigh

I meant no harm and his worship knows it none better but where is
Raleigh going to send us with a murrain

To Virginia The settlers must have help and as I trust in God we
shall be back again long before this armament can bestir itself

So Raleigh came saw and conquered Mrs Leigh consented to Amyass
going for his twelvemonth would be over ere the fleet could start
upon so peaceful and useful an errand and the next five months were
spent in continual labor on the part of Amyas and Grenville till seven
ships were all but ready in Bideford river the admiral whereof was
Amyas Leigh

But that fleet was not destined ever to see the shores of the New World
it had nobler work to do if Americans will forgive the speech than
even settling the United States

It was in the long June evenings in the year 1588 Mrs Leigh sat in
the open window busy at her needlework Ayacanora sat opposite to her
on the seat of the bay trying diligently to read The History of the
Nine Worthies and stealing a glance every now and then towards the
garden where Amyas stalked up and down as he had used to do in happier
days gone by But his brow was contracted now his eyes fixed on the
ground as he plodded backwards and forwards his hands behind his back
and a huge cigar in his mouth the wonder of the little boys of Northam
who peeped in stealthily as they passed the ironwork gates to see the
back of the famous firebreathing captain who had sailed round the world
and been in the country of headless men and flying dragons and then
popped back their heads suddenly as he turned toward them in his walk
And Ayacanora looked and looked with no less admiration than the
urchins at the gate but she got no more of an answering look from Amyas
than they did for his head was full of calculations of tonnage and
stowage of salt pork and alebarrels and the packing of tools and
seeds for he had promised Raleigh to do his best for the new colony
and he was doing it with all his might so Ayacanora looked back again
to her book and heaved a deep sigh It was answered by one from Mrs
Leigh

We are a melancholy pair sweet chuck said the fair widow What is
my maid sighing about there

Because I cannot make out the long words said Ayacanora telling a
very white fib

Is that all Come to me and I will tell you

Ayacanora moved over to her and sat down at her feet

He he ro ro ical heroical said Mrs Leigh

But what does that mean

Grand good and brave like

Mrs Leigh was about to have said the name of one who was lost to her
on earth His fair angelic face hung opposite upon the wall She paused
unable to pronounce his name and lifted up her eyes and gazed on the
portrait and breathed a prayer between closed lips and drooped her
head again

Her pupil caught at the pause and filled it up for herself

Like him and she turned her head quickly toward the window

Yes like him too said Mrs Leigh with a halfsmile at the gesture
Now mind your book Maidens must not look out of the window in school
hours

Shall I ever be an English girl asked Ayacanora

You are one now sweet your father was an English gentleman

Amyas looked in and saw the two sitting together

You seem quite merry there said he

Come in then and be merry with us

He entered and sat down while Ayacanora fixed her eyes most
steadfastly on her book

Well how goes on the reading said he and then without waiting for
an answerWe shall be ready to clear out this day week mother I do
believe that is if the hatchets are made in time to pack them

I hope they will be better than the last said Mrs Leigh It seems
to me a shameful sin to palm off on poor ignorant savages goods which we
should consider worthless for ourselves

Well its not over fair but still they are a sight better than they
ever had before An old hoop is better than a deers bone as Ayacanora
knowseh

I dont know anything about it said she who was always nettled at
the least allusion to her past wild life I am an English girl now and
all that is goneI forget it

Forget it said he teasing her for want of something better to do
Should not you like to sail with us now and see the Indians in the
forests once again

Sail with you and she looked up eagerly

There I knew it She would not be fourandtwenty hours ashore but
she would be off into the woods again bow in hand like any runaway
nymph and we should never see her more

It is false bad man and she burst into violent tears and hid her
face in Mrs Leighs lap

Amyas Amyas why do you tease the poor fatherless thing

I was only jesting Im sure said Amyas like a repentant schoolboy
Dont cry now dont cry my child see here and he began fumbling in
his pockets see what I bought of a chapman in town today for you my
maid indeed I did

And out he pulled some smart kerchief or other which had taken his
sailors fancy

Look at it now blue and crimson and green like any parrot and he
held it out

She looked round sharply snatched it out of his hand and tore it to
shreds

I hate it and I hate you and she sprang up and darted out of the
room

Oh boy boy said Mrs Leigh will you kill that poor child It
matters little for an old heart like mine which has but one or two
chords left whole how soon it be broken altogether but a young heart
is one of Gods precious treasures Amyas and suffers many a long pang
in the breaking and woe to them who despise Christs little ones

Break your heart mother

Never mind my heart dear son yet how can you break it more surely
than by tormenting one whom I love because she loves you

Tut play mother and maids tempers But how can I break your heart
What have I done Have I not given up going again to the West Indies for
your sake Have I not given up going to Virginia and now again settled
to go after all just because you commanded Was it not your will Have
I not obeyed you mother mother I will stay at home now if you will
I would rather rust here on land I vow I would than grieve you and
he threw himself at his mothers knees

Have I asked you not to go to Virginia No dear boy though every
thought of a fresh parting seems to crack some new fibre within me you
must go It is your calling Yes you were not sent into the world to
amuse me but to work I have had pleasure enough of you my darling
for many a year and too much perhaps till I shrank from lending you
to the Lord But He must have you    It is enough for the poor old
widow to know that her boy is what he is and to forget all her anguish
day by day for joy that a man is born into the world But Amyas
Amyas are you so blind as not to see that Ayacanora

Dont talk about her poor child Talk about yourself

How long have I been worth talking about No Amyas you must see it
and if you will not see it now you will see it one day in some sad and
fearful prodigy for she is not one to die tamely She loves you Amyas
as a woman only can love

Loves me Well of course I found her and brought her home and I
dont deny she may think that she owes me somewhatthough it was no
more than a Christian mans duty But as for her caring much for me
mother you measure every one elses tenderness by your own

Think that she owes you somewhat Silly boy this is not gratitude
but a deeper affection which may be more heavenly than gratitude as
it may too become a horrible cause of ruin It rests with you Amyas
which of the two it will be

You are in earnest

Have I the heart or the time to jest

No no of course not but mother I thought it was not comely for
women to fall in love with men

Not comely at least to confess their love to men But she has never
done that Amyas not even by a look or a tone of voice though I have
watched her for months

To be sure she is as demure as any cat when I am in the way I only
wonder how you found it out

Ah said she smiling sadly even in the saddest womans soul there
linger snatches of old music odors of flowers long dead and turned to
dustpleasant ghosts which still keep her mind attuned to that which
may be in others though in her never more till she can hear her own
weddinghymn reechoed in the tones of every girl who loves and sees
her own weddingtorch relighted in the eyes of every bride

You would not have me marry her asked blunt practical Amyas

God knows what I would haveI know not I see neither your path nor
my ownno not after weeks and months of prayer All things beyond are
wrapped in mist and what will be I know not save that whatever else
is wrong mercy at least is right

Id sail tomorrow if I could As for marrying her motherher birth
mind me

Ah boy boy Are you God to visit the sins of the parents upon the
children

Not that I dont mean that but I mean this that she is half a
Spaniard mother and I cannotHer blood may be as blue as King
Philips own but it is Spanish still I cannot bear the thought that my
children should have in their veins one drop of that poison

Amyas Amyas interrupted she is this not too visiting the
parents sins on the children

Not a whit it is common senseshe must have the taint of their
bloodthirsty humor She has itI have seen it in her again and again
I have told you have I not Can I forget the look of her eyes as
she stood over that galleons captain with the smoking knife in her
handUgh And she is not tamed yet as you can see and never will
benot that I care except for her own sake poor thing

Cruel boy to impute as a blame to the poor child not only the errors
of her training but the very madness of her love

Of her love

Of what else blind buzzard From the moment that you told me the story
of that captains death I knew what was in her heartand thus it is
that you requite her for having saved your life

Umph that is one word too much mother If you dont want to send me
crazy dont put the thing on the score of gratitude or duty As it is
I can hardly speak civilly to her God forgive me when I recollect
that she belongs to the crew who murdered himand he pointed to the
picture and Mrs Leigh shuddered as he did so

You feel it You know you feel it tenderhearted forgiving angel as
you are and what do you think I must feel

Oh my son my son cried she wringing her hands if I be wretch
enough to give place to the devil for a moment does that give you a
right to entertain and cherish him thus day by day

I should cherish him with a vengeance if I brought up a crew of
children who could boast of a pedigree of idolaters and tyrants hunters
of Indians and torturers of women How pleasant to hear her telling
Master Jack Your illustrious granduncle the popes legate was
the man who burned Rose Salterne at Cartagena or Miss Grace Your
greatgrandfather of sixteen quarterings the Marquis of this son of
the Grandequerry that and husband of the Princess tother used to
feed his bloodhounds when beef was scarce with Indians babies Eh
mother These things are true and if you can forget them I cannot Is
it not enough to have made me forego for awhile my purpose my business
the one thing I live for and that is hunting down the Spaniards as I
would adders or foxes but you must ask me over and above to take one to
my bosom

Oh my son my son I have not asked you to do that I have only
commanded you in Gods name to be merciful if you wish to obtain
mercy Oh if you will not pity this poor maiden pity yourself for God
knows you stand in more need of it than she does

Amyas was silent for a minute or two and then

If it were not for you mother would God that the Armada would come

What and ruin England

No Curse them Not a foot will they ever set on English soil such a
welcome would we give them If I were but in the midst of that fleet
fighting like a manto forget it all with a galleon on board of me to
larboard and another to starboardand then to put a linstock in the
magazine and go aloft in good companyI dont care how soon it comes
mother if it were not for you

If I am in your way Amyas do not fear that I shall trouble you long

Oh mother mother do not talk in that way I am halfmad I think
already and dont know what I say Yes I am mad mad at heart though
not at head Theres a fire burning me up night and day and nothing
but Spanish blood will put it out

Or the grace of God my poor wilful child Who comes to the doorso
quickly too

There was a loud hurried knocking and in another minute a servingman
hurried in with a letter

This to Captain Amyas Leigh with haste haste

It was Sir Richards hand Amyas tore it open and a loud laugh laughed
he

The Armada is coming My wish has come true mother

God help us it has Show me the letter

It was a hurried scrawl


DR GODSONWalsingham sends word that the Ada sailed from Lisbon to
the Groyne the 18 of May We know no more but have commandment to stay
the ships Come down dear lad and give us counsel and may the Lord
help His Church in this great strait

Your loving godfather

R G


Forgive me mother mother once for all cried Amyas throwing his
arms round her neck

I have nothing to forgive my son my son And shall I lose thee
also

If I be killed you will have two martyrs of your blood mother

Mrs Leigh bowed her head and was silent Amyas caught up his hat and
sword and darted forth toward Bideford

Amyas literally danced into Sir Richards hall where he stood talking
earnestly with various merchants and captains

Gloria gloria gentles all The devil is broke loose at last and now
we know where to have him on the hip

Why so merry Captain Leigh when all else are sad said a gentle
voice by his side

Because I have been sad a long time while all else were merry dear
lady Is the hawk doleful when his hood is pulled off and he sees the
heron flapping right ahead of him

You seem to forget the danger and the woe of us weak women sir

I dont forget the danger and the woe of one weak woman madam and she
the daughter of a man who once stood in this room said Amyas suddenly
collecting himself in a low stern voice And I dont forget the danger
and the woe of one who was worth a thousand even of her I dont forget
anything madam

Nor forgive either it seems

It will be time to talk of forgiveness after the offender has repented
and amended and does the sailing of the Armada look like that

Alas no God help us

He will help us madam said Amyas

Admiral Leigh said Sir Richard we need you now if ever Here are
the queens orders to furnish as many ships as we can though from these
gentlemens spirit I should say the orders were wellnigh needless

Not a doubt sir for my part I will fit my ship at my own charges
and fight her too as long as I have a leg or an arm left

Or a tongue to say never surrender Ill warrant said an old
merchant You put life into us old fellows Admiral Leigh but it
will be a heavy matter for those poor fellows in Virginia and for my
daughter too Madam Dare with her young babe as I hear just born

And a very heavy matter said some one else for those who have
ventured their money in these cargoes which must lie idle you see now
for a year maybeand then all the cost of unlading again

My good sir said Grenville what have private interests to do
with this day Let us thank God if He only please to leave us the bare
feesimple of this English soil the honor of our wives and daughters
and bodies safe from rack and fagot to wield the swords of freemen in
defence of a free land even though every town and homestead in England
were wasted with fire and we left to rebuild over again all which our
ancestors have wrought for us in now six hundred years

Right sir said Amyas For my part let my Virginian goods rot
on the quay if the worst comes to the worst I begin unloading the
Vengeance tomorrow and to sea as soon as I can fill up my crew to a
good fighting number

And so the talk ran on and ere two days were past most of the
neighboring gentlemen summoned by Sir Richard had come in and great
was the bidding against each other as to who should do most Cary and
Brimblecombe with thirty tall Clovelly men came across the bay and
without even asking leave of Amyas took up their berths as a matter of
course on board the Vengeance In the meanwhile the matter was taken
up by families The Fortescues a numberless clan offered to furnish
a ship the Chichesters another the Stukelys a third while the
merchantmen were not backward The Bucks the Stranges the Heards
joyfully unloaded their Virginian goods and replaced them with powder
and shot and in a weeks time the whole seven were ready once more for
sea and dropped down into Appledore pool with Amyas as their admiral
for the time being for Sir Richard had gone by land to Plymouth to join
the deliberations there and waited for the first favorable wind to
start for the rendezvous in the Sound

At last upon the twentyfirst of June the clank of the capstans rang
merrily across the flats and amid prayers and blessings forth sailed
that gallant squadron over the bar to play their part in Britains
Salamis while Mrs Leigh stood watching as she stood once before
beside the churchyard wall but not alone this time for Ayacanora stood
by her side and gazed and gazed till her eyes seemed ready to burst
from their sockets At last she turned away with a sob

And he never bade me goodbye mother

God forgive him Come home and pray my child there is no other rest
on earth than prayer for womans heart

They were calling each other mother and daughter then Yes The sacred
fire of sorrow was fast burning out all Ayacanoras fallen savageness
and like a Phoenix the true woman was rising from those ashes fair
noble and allenduring as God had made her



CHAPTER XXX

HOW THE ADMIRAL JOHN HAWKINS TESTIFIED AGAINST CROAKERS

 Oh where be these gay Spaniards
 Which make so great a boast O
 Oh they shall eat the graygoose feather
 And we shall eat the roast O

 Cornish Song

What if the spectators who last summer gazed with just pride upon the
noble port of Plymouth its vast breakwater spanning the Sound its
arsenals and docks its two estuaries filled with gallant ships and
watched the great screwliners turning within their own length by force
invisible or threading the crowded fleets with the ease of the tiniest
boatwhat if by some magic turn the nineteenth century and all the
magnificence of its wealth and science had vanishedas it may vanish
hereafterand they had found themselves thrown back three hundred years
into the pleasant summer days of 1588

Mount Edgecombe is still there beautiful as ever but where are the
docks and where is Devonport No vast drydock roofs rise at the
waters edge Drakes island carries but a paltry battery just raised
by the man whose name it bears Mount Wise is a lone gentlemans house
among fields the citadel is a popgun fort which a thirdclass steamer
would shell into rubble for an afternoons amusement And the shipping
where are they The floating castles of the Hamoaze have dwindled to
a few crawling limehoys and the Catwater is packed not as now with
merchant craft but with the ships who will tomorrow begin the greatest
seafight which the world has ever seen

There they lie a paltry squadron enough in modern eyes the largest of
them not equal in size to a sixandthirtygun frigate carrying less
weight of metal than one of our new gunboats and able to employ even
that at not more than a quarter of our modern range Would our modern
spectators just come down by rail for a few hours to see the cavalry
embark and return tomorrow in time for dinner have looked down upon
that petty port and petty fleet with a contemptuous smile and begun
some flippant speech about the progress of intellect and the triumphs
of science and our benighted ancestors They would have done so doubt
it not if they belonged to the many who gaze on those very triumphs
as on a rareeshow to feed their silly wonder or use and enjoy them
without thankfulness or understanding as the ox eats the clover thrust
into his rack without knowing or caring how it grew But if any of them
were of the class by whom those very triumphs have been achieved the
thinkers and the workers who instead of entering lazily into other
mens labors as the mob does labor themselves who know by hard
experience the struggles the selfrestraints the disappointments the
slow and staggering steps by which the discoverer reaches to his prize
then the smile of those men would not have been one of pity but rather
of filial love For they would have seen in those outwardly paltry
armaments the potential germ of that mightier one which now loads the
Black Sea waves they would have been aware that to produce it with
such materials and knowledge as then existed demanded an intellect an
energy a spirit of progress and invention equal if not superior to
those of which we now so loudly boast

But if again he had been a student of men rather than of machinery
he would have found few nobler companies on whom to exercise his
discernment than he might have seen in the little terrace bowlinggreen
behind the Pelican Inn on the afternoon of the nineteenth of July
Chatting in groups or lounging over the low wall which commanded a
view of the Sound and the shipping far below were gathered almost
every notable man of the Plymouth fleet the whole posse comitatus
of Englands forgotten worthies The Armada has been scattered by a
storm Lord Howard has been out to look for it as far as the Spanish
coast but the wind has shifted to the south and fearing lest the Dons
should pass him he has returned to Plymouth uncertain whether the
Armada will come after all or not Slip on for a while like Prince Hal
the drawers apron come in through the roseclad door which opens
from the tavern with a tray of longnecked Dutch glasses and a silver
tankard of wine and look round you at the gallant captains who are
waiting for the Spanish Armada as lions in their lair might wait for
the passing herd of deer

See those five talking earnestly in the centre of a ring which longs
to overhear and yet is too respectful to approach close Those soft
long eyes and pointed chin you recognize already they are Walter
Raleighs The fair young man in the flamecolored doublet whose arm
is round Raleighs neck is Lord Sheffield opposite them stands by
the side of Sir Richard Grenville a man as stately even as he Lord
Sheffields uncle the Lord Charles Howard of Effingham lord high
admiral of England next to him is his soninlaw Sir Robert Southwell
captain of the Elizabeth Jonas but who is that short sturdy plainly
dressed man who stands with legs a little apart and hands behind his
back looking up with keen gray eyes into the face of each speaker
His cap is in his hands so you can see the bullet head of crisp brown
hair and the wrinkled forehead as well as the high cheek bones the
short square face the broad temples the thick lips which are yet firm
as granite A coarse plebeian stamp of man yet the whole figure and
attitude are that of boundless determination selfpossession energy
and when at last he speaks a few blunt words all eyes are turned
respectfully upon himfor his name is Francis Drake

A burly grizzled elder in greasy seastained garments contrasting
oddly with the huge gold chain about his neck waddles up as if he had
been born and had lived ever since in a gale of wind at sea The upper
half of his sharp dogged visage seems of brickred leather the lower of
badgers fur and as he claps Drake on the back and with a broad Devon
twang shouts be you a coming to drink your wine Francis Drake or
be you notsaving your presence my lord the lord high admiral only
laughs and bids Drake go and drink his wine for John Hawkins admiral
of the port is the patriarch of Plymouth seamen if Drake be their
hero and says and does pretty much what he likes in any company on
earth not to mention that todays prospect of an Armageddon fight has
shaken him altogether out of his usual crabbed reserve and made him
overflow with loquacious goodhumor even to his rival Drake

So they push through the crowd wherein is many another man whom one
would gladly have spoken with face to face on earth Martin Frobisher
and John Davis are sitting on that bench smoking tobacco from long
silver pipes and by them are Fenton and Withrington who have both
tried to follow Drakes path round the world and failed though by no
fault of their own The man who pledges them better luck next time
is George Fenner known to the seven Portugals Leicesters pet and
captain of the galleon which Elizabeth bought of him That short prim
man in the huge yellow ruff with sharp chin minute imperial and
selfsatisfied smile is Richard Hawkins the Complete Seaman Admiral
Johns hereafter famous and hapless son The elder who is talking with
him is his good uncle William whose monument still stands or should
stand in Deptford Church for Admiral John set it up there but one year
after this time and on it record how he was A worshipper of the true
religion an especial benefactor of poor sailors a most just arbiter
in most difficult causes and of a singular faith piety and prudence
That and the fact that he got creditably through some sharp work at
Porto Rico is all I know of William Hawkins but if you or I reader
can have as much or half as much said of us when we have to follow him
we shall have no reason to complain

There is John Drake Sir Francis brother ancestor of the present stock
of Drakes and there is George his nephew a man not overwise who has
been round the world with Amyas and there is Amyas himself talking
to one who answers him with fierce curt sentences Captain Barker of
Bristol brother of the hapless Andrew Barker who found John Oxenhams
guns and owing to a mutiny among his men perished by the Spaniards in
Honduras twelve years ago Barker is now captain of the Victory one of
the queens best ships and he has his accounts to settle with the Dons
as Amyas has so they are both growling together in a corner while all
the rest are as merry as the flies upon the vine above their heads

But who is the aged man who sits upon a bench against the sunny south
wall of the tavern his long white beard flowing almost to his waist
his hands upon his knees his palsied head moving slowly from side to
side to catch the scraps of discourse of the passing captains His
greatgrandchild a little maid of six has laid her curly head upon his
knees and his granddaughter a buxom blackeyed dame of thirty stands
by him and tends him half as nurse and half too as showman for he
seems an object of curiosity to all the captains and his fair nurse has
to entreat again and again Bless you sir please now dont give him
no liquor poor old soul the doctor says It is old Martin Cockrem
father of the ancient host aged himself beyond the years of man who
can recollect the bells of Plymouth ringing for the coronation of Henry
the Eighth and who was the first Englishman perhaps who ever set foot
on the soil of the New World There he sits like an old Druid Tor of
primeval granite amid the tall wheat and rich clover crops of a modern
farm He has seen the death of old Europe and the birththroes of the
new Go to him and question him for his senses are quick as ever
and just now the old man seems uneasy He is peering with rheumy eyes
through the groups and seems listening for a wellknown voice

There a be again Why dont a come then

Quiet gramfer and dont trouble his worship

Here an hour and never speak to poor old Martin I say sirand the
old man feebly plucks Amyass cloak as he passes I say captain do e
tell young master old Martins looking for him

Marcy gramfer wheres your manners Dont be vexed sir hem amost
a babe and tejous at times mortal

Young master who says Amyas bending down to the old man and smiling
to the dame to let him have his way

Master Hawkins hem never been anear me all day

Off goes Amyas and of course lays hold of the sleeve of young Richard
Hawkins but as he is in act to speak the dame lays hold of his
laughing and blushing

No sir not Mr Richard sir Admiral John sir his father he always
calls him young master poor old soul and she points to the grizzled
beard and the face scarred and tanned with fifty years of fight and
storm

Amyas goes to the Admiral and gives his message

Mercy on me Where be my wits Iss Im acoming says the old hero in
his broadest Devon waddles off to the old man and begins lugging at
a pocket Here Martin Ive got mun Ive got mun man alive but his
Lordship keept me so Lookee here then Why I do get so lusty of late
Martin I cant get to my pockets

And out struggle a piece of tarred string a bundle of papers a
thimble a piece of puddingtobacco and last of all a little paper of
Muscovado sugarthen as great a delicacy as any French bonbons would be
nowwhich he thrusts into the old mans eager and trembling hand

Old Martin begins dipping his finger into it and rubbing it on his
toothless gums smiling and nodding thanks to his young master while
the little maid at his knee unrebuked takes her share also

There Admiral Leigh both ends meetgramfers and babies You and I
shall be like to that one day young Samson

We shall have slain a good many Philistines first I hope

Amen so be it but look to mun so fine a sailor as ever drank liquor
and now greedy after a hit of sweet trade tis piteous like but I
bring mun a hit whenever I come and he looks for it Hes one of my own
flesh like is old Martin He sailed with my father Captain Will when
they was both two little cracks aboard of a trawler and my father
went up and here I amhe didnt and there he is Wem up now we
Hawkinses We may be down again some day

Never I trust said Amyas

Taint no use trusting young man you go and do I do hear too much
of that there from my lad Let they ministers preach till theym black
in the face works is the trade with a nudge in Amyass ribs Faith
cant save nor charity nether There you tell with him while I go
play bowls with Drake Hell tell you a sight of stories You ask him
about good King Hal now just

And off waddled the Port Admiral

You have seen good King Henry then father said Amyas interested

The old mans eyes lighted at once and he stopped mumbling his sugar

Seed mun Iss I reckon I was with Captain Will when he went to meet
the Frenchman there to Calaisat the Field the Field

The Field of the Cloth of Gold gramfer suggested the dame

Thats it Seed mun Iss fegs Oh he was a king The face o mun like
a rising sun and the back o mun so broad as that there and he held
out his palsied arms and the voice of mun Oh to hear mun swear if
he was merry oh tas royalSeed mun Iss fegs And Ive seed mun do
what few has Ive seed mun christle like any child

Whatcry said Amyas I shouldnt have thought there was much cry in
him

You think what you like

Gramfer gramfer dont you be rude now

Let him go on said Amyas

I seed mun christle and oh dear how he did put hands on muns face
and Oh my gentlemen says he my gentlemen Oh my gallant men
Them was his very words

But when

Why Captain Will had just come to the Hardthats to Portsmouthto
speak with mun and the barge Royal lay again the Hardso and our boot
alongsideso and the king he standth as it might be there above my
head on the quay edge and she come in near abreast of us looking most
royal to behold poor dear and went to cast about And Captain Will
saith he Them lower ports is cruel near the water for she had not
more than a sixteen inches to spare in the nether overloop as I heard
after And saith he That wont do for going to windward in a say
Martin And as the words came out of muns mouth your worship there
was a bit of a flaw from the westward sharp like and overboard goeth
my cap and hitth against the wall and as I stooped to pick it up I
heard a cry and it was all over

He is telling of the Mary Rose sir

I guessed so

All over and the cry of mun and the screech of mun Oh sir up to
the very heavens And the king he screeched right out like any maid Oh
my gentlemen oh my gallant men and as she lay on her beamends sir
and just asettling the very last souls I seen was that mans father
and that mans I knowed mun by their armor

And he pointed to Sir George Carew and Sir Richard Grenville

Iss Iss Drowned like rattens Drowned like rattens

Now you mustnt trouble his worship any more

Trouble Let him tell till midnight I shall be well pleased said
Amyas sitting down on the bench by him Drawer aleand a parcel of
tobacco

And Amyas settled himself to listen while the old man purred to
himself

Iss They likes to hear old Martin All the captains look upon old
Martin

Hillo Amyas said Cary whos your friend Heres a man been telling
me wonders about the River Plate We should go thither for luck there
next time

River Plate said old Martin Its I knows about the River Plate
none so well Whod ever been there nor heard of it nether before
Captain Will and me went and I lived among the savages a whole year
and audacious civil I found em if they d had but shirts to their
backs and so was the prince o mun that Captain Will brought home to
King Henry leastwise he died on the voyage but the wild folk took it
cruel well for you see we was always as civil with them as Christians
and if we hadnt been I should not have been here now

What year was that

In the fifteen thirty but I was there afore and learnt the speech
o mun and thats why Captain Will left me to a hostage when he tuked
their prince

Before that said Cary why the country was hardly known before
that

The old mans eyes flashed up in triumph

Knowed Iss and you may well say that Look ye here Look to mun and
he waved his hand roundTheres captains and Im the father of em
all now now poor Captain Wills in gloory I Martin Cockrem   
Iss Ive seen a change I mind when Tavistock Abbey was so full
o friars and goolden idols and sich noxious trade as ever was a
wheatrick of rats I mind the fight off Brest in the French warsOh
that was a fight surelywhen the Regent and the French Carack were
burnt side by side being fast grappled you see because of Sir Thomas
Knivet and Captain Will gave him warning as he ran apast us saying
says he

But said Amyas seeing that the old man was wandering away what do
you mind about America

America I should think so But I was agoing to tell you of the
Regentand seven hundred Englishmen burnt and drowned in her and nine
hundred French in the Brest ship besides what we picked up Oh dear
But about America

Yes about America How are you the father of all the captains

How you ask my young master Why before the fifteen thirty I was up
the Plate with Cabot and a cruel fractious ontrustful fellow he was
like all they Portingals and bid there a year and more and up the
Paraguaio with him diskivering no end whereby gentles I was the
first Englishman I hold that ever sot a foot on the New World I was

Then heres your health and long life sir said Amyas and Cary

Long life Iss fegs I reckon long enough aready Why I mind the
beginning of it all I do I mind when there wasnt a master mariner
to Plymouth that thought there was aught west of the Lands End except
herrings Why they held them pure wratches that if you sailed right
west away far enough youd surely come to the edge and fall over
cleve IssTwas dark parts round here till Captain Will arose and
the first of it I mind was inside the bar of San Lucar and he and I
were boys about a ten year old aboord of a Dartmouth ship and went
for wine and there come in over the bar he that was the beginning of it
all

Columbus

Iss fegs he did not a pistolshot from us and I saw mun stand on
the poop so plain as I see you no great shakes of a man to look
to nether theres a sight better here to plase me and we was
disappointed we lads for we surely expected to see mun with a goolden
crown on and a sceptre to as hand we did and the ship o mun all
over like Solomons temple for gloory And I mind that same year too
seeing Vasco da Gama as was going out over the bar when he found
the Bona Speranza and sailed round it to the Indies Ah that was the
making of they rascally Portingals it was    And our crew told what
they seen and heerd but nobody minded sich things Twas dark parts
and Popish then and nobody knowed nothing nor got no schooling nor
cared for nothing but scrattling up and down alongshore like to prawns
in a pule Iss sitting in darkness we was and the shadow of death
till the dayspring from on high arose and shined upon us poor
outotheway folkThe Lord be praised And now look to mun and he
waved his hand all roundLook to mun Look to the works of the Lord
Look to the captains Oh blessed sight And ones been to the Brazils
and one to the Indies and the Spanish Main and the NorthWest and the
Rooshias and the Chinas and up the Straits and round the Cape
and round the world of God too bless His holy name and I seed the
beginning of it and Ill see the end of it too I will I was born into
the old times but Ill see the wondrous works of the new yet I will
Ill see they bloody Spaniards swept off the seas before I die if my
old eyes can reach so far as outside the Sound I shall I knows it I
says my prayers for it every night dont I Mary Youll bate mun sure
as Judgment youll bate mun The Lordll fight for ye Nothingll stand
against ye Ive seed it all alongever since I was with young master
to the Honduras They cant bide the push of us Youll bate mun off
the face of the seas and be masters of the round world and all that
therein is And then Ill just turn my old face to the wall and depart
in peace according to his word

Deary me now while Ive been telling with you hereve this little
maid been and ate up all my sugar

Ill bring you some more said Amyas whom the childish bathos of the
last sentence moved rather to sighs than laughter

Will ye then Theres a good soul and come and tell with old Martin
He likes to see the brave young gentlemen agoing to and fro in their
ships like Leviathan and taking of their pastime therein We had
no such ships to our days Ah tis grand times beautiful times
surelyand youll bring me a bit sugar

You were up the Plate with Cabot said Cary after a pause Do you
mind the fair lady Miranda Sebastian de Hurtados wife

What her that was burnt by the Indians Mind her Do you mind the sun
in heaven Oh the beauty Oh the ways of her Oh the speech of her
Never was nor never will be And she to die by they villains and all
for the goodness of her Mind her I minded naught else when she was on
deck

Who was she asked Amyas of Cary

A Spanish angel Amyas

Humph said Amyas So much the worse for her to be born into a
nation of devils

Theyem not all so bad as that yer honor Her husband was a proper
gallant gentleman and kind as a maid too and couldnt abide that De
Soliss murderous doings

His wife must have taught it him then said Amyas rising Where did
you hear of these black swans Cary

I have heard of them and thats enough answered he unwilling to
stir sad recollections

And little enough said Amyas Will dont talk to me The devil is
not grown white because he has trod in a limeheap

Or an angel black because she came down a chimney said Cary and so
the talk ended or rather was cut short for the talk of all the groups
was interrupted by an explosion from old John Hawkins

Fail Fail What a murrain do you here to talk of failing Who made
you a prophet you scurvy hanginthewind croaking whitelivered son
of a corbycrow

Heaven help us Admiral Hawkins who has put fire to your culverins in
this fashion said Lord Howard

Who my lord Croakers my lord Heres a fellow calls himself the
captain of a ship and her majestys servant and talks about failing
as if he were a Barbican loosekirtle trying to keep her applesquire
ashore Blurt for him sneakup say I

Admiral John Hawkins quoth the offender you shall answer this
language with your sword

Ill answer it with my foot and buy me a pair of horntips to my
shoes like a wraxling man Fight a croaker Fight a frog an owl I
fight those that dare fight sir

Sir sir moderate yourself I am sure this gentleman will show himself
as brave as any when it comes to blows but who can blame mortal man
for trembling before so fearful a chance as this

Let mortal man keep his tremblings to himself then my lord and not
be like Solomons madmen casting abroad fire and death and saying it
is only in sport There is more than one of his kidney your lordship
who have not been ashamed to play Mother Shipton before their own
sailors and damp the poor fellows hearts with crying before theyre
hurt and this is one of them Ive heard him at it afore and Ill
present him with a vengeance though Im no churchwarden

If this is really so Admiral Hawkins

It is so my lord I heard only last night down in a tavern below
such unbelieving talk as made me mad my lord and if it had not been
after supper and my hand was not oversteady I would have let out a
pottle of Alicant from some of their hoopings and sent them to Dick
Surgeon to wrap them in swaddlingclouts like whining babies as
they are Marry come up what says Scripture He that is fearful and
fainthearted among you let him go andwhat son Dick there Thourt
pious and readst thy Bible Whats that text A mortal fine one it is
too

He that is fearful and fainthearted among you let him go back
quoth the Complete Seaman Captain Merryweather as my fathers
command as well as his years forbid his answering your challenge I
shall repute it an honor to entertain his quarrel myselfplace time
and weapons being at your choice

Well spoken son Dickand like a true courtier too Ah thou hast
the palabras and the knee and the cap and the quip and the innuendo
and the true town fashion of it allno old tarrybreeks of a seadog
like thy dad My lord youll let them fight

The Spaniard sir but no one else But captains and gentlemen
consider well my friend the Port Admirals advice and if any mans
heart misgives him let him for the sake of his country and his queen
have so much government of his tongue to hide his fears in his own
bosom and leave open complaining to ribalds and women For if the
sailor be not cheered by his commanders cheerfulness how will the
ignorant man find comfort in himself And without faith and hope how
can he fight worthily

There is no croaking aboard of us we will warrant said twenty
voices and shall be none as long as we command on board our own
ships

Hawkins having blown off his steam went back to Drake and the bowls

Fill my pipe Drawerthat croaking fellows made me let it out of
course Spoilsports The father of all manner of troubles on earth
be they noxious trade of croakers Better to meet a bear robbed of her
whelps Francis Drake as Solomon saith than a fule who cant keep his
mouth shut What brought Mr Andrew Barker to his death but croakers
What stopped Fentons China voyage in the 82 and lost your nephew
John and my brother Will glory and hard cash too but croakers What
sent back my Lord Cumberlands armada in the 86 and that after theyd
proved their strength too sixty o mun against six hundred Portugals
and Indians and yet wernt ashamed to turn round and come home
emptyhanded after all my lords expenses that he had been at What
but these same beggarly croakers that be only fit to be turned into
yellowhammers up to Dartymoor and sit on a tor all day and cry Very
little bit of bread and no cheeeese Marry sneakup say I again

And what said Drake would have kept me if Id let em from ever
sailing round the world but these same croakers I hanged my best
friend for croaking John Hawkins may God forgive me if I was wrong
and I threatened a week after to hang thirty more and Id have done it
too if they hadnt clapped tompions into their muzzles pretty fast

Youm right Frank My old father always told meand old King Hal
bless his memory would take his counsel among a thousandAnd my
son says he to me whatever you do never you stand no croaking but
hang mun son Jack hang mun up for an ensign Theres Scripture for
it says he he was a mighty man to his Bible after bloody Marys
days leastwise and tis written says he Its expedient that one
man die for the crew and that the whole crew perish not so show you
no mercy son Jack or youll find none leastwise in they manner of
cattle for if you fail they stamps on you and if you succeeds they
takes the credit of it to themselves and goes to heaven in your shoes
Those were his words and Ive found mun trueWho comth here now

Captain Fleming as Im a sinner

Fleming Is he tired of life that he comth here to look for a halter
Ive a warrant out against mun for robbing of two Flushingers on the
high seas now this very last year Is the fellow mazed or drunk then
or has he seen a ghost Look to mun

I think so truly said Drake His eyes are near out of his head

The man was a roughbearded old seadog who had just burst in from the
tavern through the low hatch upsetting a drawer with all his glasses
and now came panting and blowing straight up to the high admiral

My lord my lord Theym coming I saw them off the Lizard last night

Who my good sir who seem to have left your manners behind you

The Armada your worshipthe Spaniard but as for my manners tis no
fault of mine for I never had none to leave behind me

If he has not left his manners behind quoth Hawkins look out for
your purses gentlemen all Hes manners enough and very bad ones they
be when he comth across a quiet Flushinger

If I stole Flushingers wines I never stole negurs souls Jack
Hawkins so theres your answer My lord hang me if you will lifes
short and deaths easy specially to seamen but if I didnt see the
Spanish fleet last sundown coming along halfmoon wise and full seven
mile from wing to wing within a four mile of me Im a sinner

Sirrah said Lord Howard is this no fetch to cheat us out of your
pardon for these piracies of yours

Youll find out for yourself before nightfall my lord high admiral
All Jack Fleming says is that this is a poor sort of an answer to a man
who has put his own neck into the halter for the sake of his country

Perhaps it is said Lord Howard And after all gentlemen what can
this man gain by a lie which must be discovered ere a day is over
except a more certain hanging

Very true your lordship said Hawkins mollified Come here Jack
Flemingwhat wilt drain man Hippocras or Alicant Sack or John
Barleycorn and a pledge to thy repentance and amendment of life

Admiral Hawkins Admiral Hawkins this is no time for drinking

Why not then my lord Good news should be welcomed with good wine
Frank send down to the sexton and set the bells aringing to cheer up
all honest hearts Why my lord if it were not for the gravity of my
office I could dance a galliard for joy

Well you may dance port admiral but I must go and plan but God give
to all captains such a heart as yours this day

And God give all generals such a head as yours Come Frank Drake
well play the game out before we move It will be two good days before
we shall be fit to tackle them so an odd halfhour dont matter

I must command the help of your counsel viceadmiral said Lord
Charles turning to Drake

And its this my good lord said Drake looking up as he aimed his
bowl Theyll come soon enough for us to show them sport and yet slow
enough for us to be ready so let no man hurry himself And as example
is better than precept here goes

Lord Howard shrugged his shoulders and departed knowing two things
first that to move Drake was to move mountains and next that when the
selftaught hero did bestir himself he would do more work in an hour
than any one else in a day So he departed followed hastily by most of
the captains and Drake said in a low voice to Hawkins

Does he think we are going to knock about on a leeshore all the
afternoon and run our noses at nightand dead upwind toointo the
Dons mouths No Jack my friend Let OrlandoFuriosopunctiliofire
eaters go and get their knuckles rapped The following game is the game
and not the meeting one The dog goes after the sheep and not afore
them lad Let them go by and go by and stick to them well to
windward and pick up stragglers and pickings too Jackthe prizes
Jack

Trust my old eyes for not being overquick at seeing signals if I be
hanging in the skirts of a fatlooking Don Wem the eagles Drake and
where the carcase is is our place eh

And so the two old seadogs chatted on while their companions dropped
off one by one and only Amyas remained

Eh Captain Leigh wheres my boy Dick

Gone off with his lordship Sir John

On his punctilios too I suppose the young slashedbreeks Hes half
a Don that fellow with his fine scholarship and his fine manners
and his fine clothes Hell get a taking down before he dies unless he
mends Why aint you gone too sir

I follow my leader said Amyas filling his pipe

Well said my big man quoth Drake If I could lead you round the
world I can lead you up Channel cant IEh my little bantamcock of
the Orinoco Drink lad Youre oversad today

Not a whit said Amyas Only I cant help wondering whether I shall
find him after all

Whom That Don Well find him for you if hes in the fleet Well
squeeze it out of our prisoners somehow Eh Hawkins I thought all the
captains had promised to send you news if they heard of him

Ay but its ill looking for a needle in a haystack But I shall find
him I am a coward to doubt it said Amyas setting his teeth

There viceadmiral youre beaten and thats the rubber Pay up
three dollars old highflyer and go and earn more like an honest
adventurer

Well said Drake as he pulled out his purse well walk down now
and see about these young hotheads As I live they are setting to tow
the ships out already Breaking the mens backs overnight to make them
fight the lustier in the morning Well well they havent sailed round
the world Jack Hawkins

Or had to run home from San Juan dUlloa with half a crew

Well if we havent to run out with half crews I saw a sight of our
lads drunk about this morning

The more reason for waiting till they be sober Besides if everybodys
caranting about to once each after his own men nobodyll find nothing
in such a scrimmage as that Bye bye Uncle Martin Wem going to blow
the Dons up now in earnest



CHAPTER XXXI

THE GREAT ARMADA

 Britannia needs no bulwarks
 No towers along the steep
 Her march is oer the mountain wave
 Her home is on the deep

 CAMPBELL Ye Mariners of England

And now began that great seafight which was to determine whether Popery
and despotism or Protestantism and freedom were the law which God had
appointed for the half of Europe and the whole of future America It
is a twelve days epic worthy as I said in the beginning of this book
not of dull prose but of the thunderroll of Homers verse but having
to tell it I must do my best rather using where I can the words of
contemporary authors than my own

The Lord High Admirall of England sending a pinnace before called
the Defiance denounced war by discharging her ordnance and presently
approaching with in musquetshot with much thundering out of his own
ship called the Arkroyall alias the Triumph first set upon the
admiralls as he thought of the Spaniards but it was Alfonso de
Leons ship Soon after Drake Hawkins and Frobisher played stoutly
with their ordnance on the hindmost squadron which was commanded by
Recalde The Spaniards soon discover the superior nimbleness of the
English ships and Recaldes squadron finding that they are getting
more than they give in spite of his endeavors hurry forward to join
the rest of the fleet Medina the Admiral finding his ships scattering
fast gathers them into a halfmoon and the Armada tries to keep solemn
way forward like a stately herd of buffaloes who march on across the
prairie disdaining to notice the wolves which snarl around their track
But in vain These are no wolves but cunning hunters swiftly horsed
and keenly armed and who will shamefully shuffle to use Drakes own
expression that vast herd from the Lizard to Portland from Portland
to Calais Roads and who even in this short two hours fight have made
many a Spaniard question the boasted invincibleness of this Armada

One of the four great galliasses is already riddled with shot to the
great disarrangement of her pulpits chapels and friars therein
assistant The fleet has to close round her or Drake and Hawkins
will sink her in effecting which manoeuvre the principal galleon of
Seville in which are Pedro de Valdez and a host of blueblooded Dons
runs foul of her neighbor carries away her foremast and is in spite
of Spanish chivalry left to her fate This does not look like victory
certainly But courage though Valdez be left behind our Lady and
the saints and the bull Caena Domini dictated by one whom I dare not
name here are with them still and it were blasphemous to doubt But
in the meanwhile if they have fared no better than this against a
third of the Plymouth fleet how will they fare when those forty
belated ships which are already whitening the blue between them and the
Mewstone enter the scene to play their part

So ends the first day not an English ship hardly a man is hurt
It has destroyed for ever in English minds the prestige of boastful
Spain It has justified utterly the policy which the good Lord Howard
had adopted by Raleighs and Drakes advice of keeping up a running
fight instead of clapping ships together without consideration in
which case says Raleigh he had been lost if he had not been better
advised than a great many malignant fools were who found fault with his
demeanor

Be that as it may so ends the first day in which Amyas and the other
Bideford ships have been right busy for two hours knocking holes in a
huge galleon which carries on her poop a maiden with a wheel and bears
the name of Sta Catharina She had a coat of arms on the flag at her
sprit probably those of the commandant of soldiers but they were shot
away early in the fight so Amyas cannot tell whether they were De
Sotos or not Nevertheless there is plenty of time for private
revenge and Amyas called off at last by the admirals signal goes
to bed and sleeps soundly

But ere he has been in his hammock an hour he is awakened by Carys
coming down to ask for orders

We were to follow Drakes lantern Amyas but where it is I cant
see unless he has been taken up aloft there among the stars for a new
Drakium Sidus

Amyas turns out grumbling but no lantern is to be seen only a sudden
explosion and a great fire on board some Spaniard which is gradually
got under while they have to lieto the whole night long with nearly
the whole fleet

The next morning finds them off Torbay and Amyas is hailed by a
pinnace bringing a letter from Drake which saving the spelling which
was somewhat arbitrary like most mens in those days ran somewhat
thus


DEAR LADI have been woolgathering all night after five great hulks
which the Pixies transfigured overnight into galleons and this morning
again into German merchantmen I let them go with my blessing and
coming back fell in God be thanked with Valdez great galleon
and in it good booty which the Dons his fellows had left behind like
faithful and valiant comrades and the Lord Howard had let slip past
him thinking her deserted by her crew I have sent to Dartmouth a sight
of noblemen and gentlemen maybe a halfhundred and Valdez himself who
when I sent my pinnace aboard must needs stand on his punctilios and
propound conditions I answered him I had no time to tell with him if
he would needs die then I was the very man for him if he would live
then buena querra He sends again boasting that he was Don Pedro
Valdez and that it stood not with his honor and that of the Dons in
his company I replied that for my part I was Francis Drake and my
matches burning Whereon he finds in my name salve for the wounds of
his own and comes aboard kissing my fist with Spanish lies of holding
himself fortunate that he had fallen into the hands of fortunate Drake
and much more which he might have kept to cool his porridge But I have
much news from him for he is a leaky tub and among others this
that your Don Guzman is aboard of the Sta Catharina commandant of her
soldiery and has his arms flying at her sprit beside Sta Catharina at
the poop which is a maiden with a wheel and is a lofty built ship of
3 tier of ordnance from which God preserve you and send you like luck
with

Your deare Friend and Admirall

F Drake

She sails in this squadron of Recalde The Armada was minded to smoke
us out of Plymouth and Gods grace it was they tried not but their
orders from home are too strait and so the slaves fight like a bull
in a tether no farther than their rope finding thus the devil a hard
master as do most in the end They cannot compass our quick handling
and tacking and take us for very witches So far so good and better
to come You and I know the length of their foot of old Time and light
will kill any hare and they will find it a long way from Start to
Dunkirk


The admiral is in a gracious humor Leigh to have vouchsafed you so
long a letter

St Catherine why that was the galleon we hammered all yesterday
said Amyas stamping on the deck

Of course it was Well we shall find her again doubt not That
cunning old Drake how he has contrived to line his own pockets even
though he had to keep the whole fleet waiting for him

He has given the lord high admiral the dor at all events

Lord Howard is too highhearted to stop and plunder Papist though he
is Amyas

Amyas answered by a growl for he worshipped Drake and was not too just
to Papists

The fleet did not find Lord Howard till nightfall he and Lord Sheffield
had been holding on steadfastly the whole night after the Spanish
lanterns with two ships only At least there was no doubt now of the
loyalty of English Roman Catholics and indeed throughout the fight
the Howards showed as if to wipe out the slurs which had been cast on
their loyalty by fanatics a desperate courage which might have thrust
less prudent men into destruction but led them only to victory Soon a
large Spaniard drifts by deserted and partly burnt Some of the men are
for leaving their place to board her but Amyas stoutly refuses He has
come out to fight and not to plunder so let the nearest ship to her
have her luck without grudging They pass on and the men pull long
faces when they see the galleon snapped up by their next neighbor
and towed off to Weymouth where she proves to be the ship of Miguel
dOquenda the viceadmiral which they saw last night all but blown up
by some desperate Netherland gunner who being misused was minded to
pay off old scores on his tyrants

And so ends the second day while the Portland rises higher and clearer
every hour The next morning finds them off the island Will they try
Portsmouth though they have spared Plymouth The wind has shifted
to the north and blows clear and cool off the whitewalled downs of
Weymouth Bay The Spaniards turn and face the English They must mean
to stand off and on until the wind shall change and then to try for
the Needles At least they shall have some work to do before they round
Purbeck Isle

The English go to the westward again but it is only to return on the
opposite tack and now begin a series of manoeuvres each fleet trying
to get the wind of the other but the struggle does not last long and
ere noon the English fleet have slipped closehauled between the Armada
and the land and are coming down upon them right before the wind

And now begins a fight most fierce and fell And fight they did
confusedly and with variable fortunes while on the one hand the
English manfully rescued the ships of London which were hemmed in
by the Spaniards and on the other side the Spaniards as stoutly
delivered Recalde being in danger Never was heard such thundering of
ordnance on both sides which notwithstanding from the Spaniards
flew for the most part over the English without harm Only Cock an
Englishman whom Prince claims I hope rightfully as a worthy of
Devon died with honor in the midst of the enemies in a small ship of
his For the English ships being far the lesser charged the enemy with
marvellous agility and having discharged their broadsides flew forth
presently into the deep and levelled their shot directly without
missing at those great and unwieldy Spanish ships This was the most
furious and bloody skirmish of all though ending only it seems in
the capture of a great Venetian and some small craft in which the
lord admiral fighting amidst his enemies fleet and seeing one of his
captains afar off Fenner by name he who fought the seven Portugals at
the Azores cried O George what doest thou Wilt thou now frustrate
my hope and opinion conceived of thee Wilt thou forsake me now With
which words he being enflamed approached and did the part of a most
valiant captain as indeed did all the rest

Night falls upon the floating volcano and morning finds them far past
Purbeck with the white peak of Freshwater ahead and pouring out past
the Needles ship after ship to join the gallant chase For now from
all havens in vessels fitted out at their own expense flock the
chivalry of England the Lords Oxford Northumberland and Cumberland
Pallavicin Brooke Carew Raleigh and Blunt and many another
honorable name as to a set field where immortal fame and honor was to
be attained Spain has staked her chivalry in that mighty cast not a
noble house of Arragon or Castile but has lent a brother or a sonand
shall mourn the loss of one and Englands gentlemen will measure their
strength once for all against the Cavaliers of Spain Lord Howard has
sent forward light craft into Portsmouth for ammunition but they will
scarce return tonight for the wind falls dead and all the evening the
two fleets drift helpless with the tide and shout idle defiance at each
other with trumpet fife and drum

The sun goes down upon a glassy sea and rises on a glassy sea again
But what day is this The twentyfifth St Jamessday sacred to the
patron saint of Spain Shall nothing be attempted in his honor by
those whose forefathers have so often seen him with their bodily eyes
charging in their van upon his snowwhite steed and scattering Paynims
with celestial lance He might have sent them certainly a favoring
breeze perhaps he only means to try their faith at least the galleys
shall attack and in their van three of the great galliasses the fourth
lies halfcrippled among the fleet thrash the sea to foam with three
hundred oars apiece and see not St James leading them to victory but
Lord Howards Triumph his brothers Lion Southwells Elizabeth Jonas
Lord Sheffields Bear Barkers Victory and George Fenners Leicester
towed stoutly out to meet them with such salvoes of chainshot
smashing oars and cutting rigging that had not the wind sprung up
again toward noon and the Spanish fleet come up to rescue them they
had shared the fate of Valdez and the Biscayan And now the fight
becomes general Frobisher beats down the Spanish admirals mainmast
and attacked himself by Mexia and Recalde is rescued by Lord Howard
who himself endangered in his turn is rescued in his turn while
after that day so sickened were they of the English gunnery no
galliasse would adventure to fight

And so with variable fortune the fight thunders on the livelong
afternoon beneath the virgin cliffs of Freshwater while myriad
seafowl rise screaming up from every ledge and spot with their black
wings the snowwhite wall of chalk and the lone shepherd hurries down
the slopes above to peer over the dizzy edge and forgets the wheatear
fluttering in his snare while he gazes trembling upon glimpses of tall
masts and gorgeous flags piercing at times the leaguebroad veil of
sulphursmoke which welters far below

So fares St Jamessday as Baals did on Carmel in old time Either
he is talking or he is pursuing or he is on a journey or peradventure
he sleepeth and must be awaked At least the only fire by which he
has answered his votaries has been that of English cannon and the
Armada gathering itself into a roundel will fight no more but make
the best of its way to Calais where perhaps the Guises faction may
have a French force ready to assist them and then to Dunkirk to join
with Parma and the great flotilla of the Netherlands

So on before a fair Etesian gale which follows clear and bright
out of the southsouthwest glide forward the two great fleets past
Brighton Cliffs and Beachy Head Hastings and Dungeness Is it a battle
or a triumph For by sea Lord Howard instead of fighting is rewarding
and after Lord Thomas Howard Lord Sheffield Townsend and Frobisher
have received at his hands that knighthood which was then more
honorable than a peerage old Admiral Hawkins kneels and rises up Sir
John and shaking his shoulders after the accolade observes to the
representative of majesty that his old woman will hardly know herself
again when folks call her My Lady

And meanwhile the cliffs are lined with pikemen and musketeers and by
every countryman and groom who can bear arms led by their squires and
sheriffs marching eastward as fast as their weapons let them towards
the Dover shore And not with them alone From many a mile inland come
down women and children and aged folk in wagons to join their feeble
shouts and prayers which are not feeble to that great cry of mingled
faith and fear which ascends to the throne of God from the spectators of
Britains Salamis

Let them pray on The danger is not over yet though Lord Howard has had
news from Newhaven that the Guises will not stir against England and
Seymour and Winter have left their post of observation on the Flemish
shores to make up the number of the fleet to an hundred and forty
saillarger slightly than that of the Spanish fleet but of not more
than half the tonnage or one third the number of men The Spaniards are
dispirited and battered but unbroken still and as they slide to their
anchorage in Calais Roads on the Saturday evening of that most memorable
week all prudent men know well that Englands hour is come and that
the bells which will call all Christendom to church upon the morrow
morn will be either the deathknell or the triumphal peal of the
Reformed faith throughout the world

A solemn day that Sabbath must have been in country and in town And
many a lighthearted coward doubtless who had scoffed as many did at
the notion of the Armadas coming because he dare not face the thought
gave himself up to abject fear as he now plainly saw and heard that of
which before he would not be persuaded And many a brave man too as
he knelt beside his wife and daughters felt his heart sink to the very
pavement at the thought of what those beloved ones might be enduring a
few short days hence from a profligate and fanatical soldiery or from
the more deliberate fiendishness of the Inquisition The massacre of St
Bartholomew the fires of Smithfield the immolation of the Moors
the extermination of the West Indians the fantastic horrors of the
Piedmontese persecution which make unreadable the too truthful pages
of Morlandthese were the spectres which not as now dim and distant
through the mist of centuries but recent bleeding from still gaping
wounds flitted before the eyes of every Englishman and filled his
brain and heart with fire

He knew full well the fate in store for him and his One false step and
the unspeakable doom which not two generations afterwards befell the
Lutherans of Magdeburg would have befallen every town from London to
Carlisle All knew the hazard as they prayed that day and many a day
before and after throughout England and the Netherlands And none knew
it better than she who was the guiding spirit of that devoted land
and the especial mark of the invaders fury and who by some Divine
inspiration as men then not unwisely held devised herself the daring
stroke which was to anticipate the coming blow

But where is Amyas Leigh all this while Day after day he has been
seeking the Sta Catharina in the thickest of the press and cannot come
at her cannot even hear of her one moment he dreads that she has sunk
by night and balked him of his prey the next that she has repaired
her damages and will escape him after all He is moody discontented
restless even for the first time in his life peevish with his men He
can talk of nothing but Don Guzman he can find no better employment
at every spare moment than taking his sword out of the sheath and
handling it fondling it talking to it even bidding it not to fail him
in the day of vengeance At last he has sent to Squire the armorer
for a whetstone and halfashamed of his own folly whets and polishes
it in byecorners muttering to himself That one fixed thought of
selfish vengeance has possessed his whole mind he forgets Englands
present need her past triumph his own safety everything but his
brothers blood And yet this is the day for which he has been longing
ever since he brought home that magic horn as a fifteen years boy the
day when he should find himself face to face with an invader and
that invader Antichrist himself He has believed for years with Drake
Hawkins Grenville and Raleigh that he was called and sent into the
world only to fight the Spaniard and he is fighting him now in such a
cause for such a stake within such battlelists as he will never
see again and yet he is not content and while throughout that gallant
fleet whole crews are receiving the Communion side by side and rising
with cheerful faces to shake hands and to rejoice that they are sharers
in Britains Salamis Amyas turns away from the holy elements

I cannot communicate Sir John Charity with all men I hate if ever
man hated on earth

You hate the Lords foes only Captain Leigh

No Jack I hate my own as well

But no one in the fleet sir

Dont try to put me off with the same Jesuits quibble which that false
knave Parson Fletcher invented for one of Doughtys men to drug his
conscience withal when he was plotting against his own admiral No
Jack I hate one of whom you know and somehow that hatred of him keeps
me from loving any human being I am in love and charity with no man
Sir John Brimblecombenot even with you Go your ways in Gods name
sir and leave me and the devil alone together or youll find my words
are true

Jack departed with a sigh and while the crew were receiving the
Communion on deck Amyas sate below in the cabin sharpening his sword
and after it called for a boat and went on board Drakes ship to ask
news of the Sta Catharina and listened scowling to the loud chants and
tinkling bells which came across the water from the Spanish fleet At
last Drake was summoned by the lord admiral and returned with a secret
commission which ought to bear fruit that night and Amyas who had
gone with him helped him till nightfall and then returned to his own
ship as Sir Amyas Leigh Knight to the joy and glory of every soul on
board except his moody self

So there the livelong summer Sabbathday before the little highwalled
town and the long range of yellow sandhills lie those two mighty
armaments scowling at each other hardly out of gunshot Messenger
after messenger is hurrying towards Bruges to the Duke of Parma for
light craft which can follow these nimble English somewhat better than
their own floating castles and above all entreating him to put to sea
at once with all his force The duke is not with his forces at Dunkirk
but on the future field of Waterloo paying his devotions to St Mary
of Halle in Hainault in order to make all sure in his Pantheon and
already sees in visions of the night that gentlesouled and purelipped
saint Cardinal Allen placing the crown of England on his head He
returns for answer first that his victual is not ready next that his
Dutch sailors who have been kept at their post for many a week at the
swords point have run away like water and thirdly that over and
above all he cannot come so strangely provided of great ordnance and
musketeers are those fiveandthirty Dutch ships in which roundsterned
and stubbornhearted heretics watch like terriers at a rats hole the
entrance of Nieuwport and Dunkirk Having ensured the private patronage
of St Mary of Halle he will return tomorrow to make experience of its
effects but only hear across the flats of Dixmude the thunder of the
fleets and at Dunkirk the open curses of his officers For while he
has been praying and nothing more the English have been praying and
something more and all that is left for the Prince of Parma is to
hang a few purveyors as peace offerings to his sulking army and then
chafe as Drake says of him like a bear robbed of her whelps

For Lord Henry Seymour has brought Lord Howard a letter of command from
Elizabeths self and Drake has been carrying it out so busily all that
Sunday long that by two oclock on the Monday morning eight fireships
besmeared with wildfire brimstone pitch and resin and all their
ordnance charged with bullets and with stones are stealing down the
wind straight for the Spanish fleet guided by two valiant men of Devon
Young and Prowse Let their names live long in the land The ships are
fired the men of Devon steal back and in a moment more the heaven is
red with glare from Dover Cliffs to Gravelines Tower and wearyhearted
Belgian boors far away inland plundered and dragooned for many a
hideous year leap from their beds and fancy and not so far wrongly
either that the day of judgment is come at last to end their woes and
hurl down vengeance on their tyrants

And then breaks forth one of those disgraceful panics which so often
follow overweening presumption and shrieks oaths prayers and
reproaches make night hideous There are those too on board who
recollect well enough Jenebellis fireships at Antwerp three years
before and the wreck which they made of Parmas bridge across the
Scheldt If these should be like them And cutting all cables hoisting
any sails the Invincible Armada goes lumbering wildly out to sea every
ship foul of her neighbor

The largest of the four galliasses loses her rudder and drifts helpless
to and fro hindering and confusing The duke having so the Spaniards
say weighed his anchor deliberately instead of leaving it behind him
runs in again after awhile and fires a signal for return but his
truant sheep are deaf to the shepherds pipe and swearing and praying
by turns he runs up Channel towards Gravelines picking up stragglers
on his way who are struggling as they best can among the flats and
shallows but Drake and Fenner have arrived as soon as he When Mondays
sun rises on the quaint old castle and muddy dykes of Gravelines town
the thunder of the cannon recommences and is not hushed till night
Drake can hang coolly enough in the rear to plunder when he thinks fit
but when the battle needs it none can fight more fiercely among the
foremost and there is need now if ever That Armada must never be
allowed to reform If it does its left wing may yet keep the English
at bay while its right drives off the blockading Hollanders from
Dunkirk port and sets Parma and his flotilla free to join them and to
sail in doubled strength across to the mouth of Thames

So Drake has weighed anchor and away up Channel with all his squadron
the moment that he saw the Spanish fleet come up and with him Fenner
burning to redeem the honor which indeed he had never lost and ere
Fenton Beeston Crosse Ryman and Lord Southwell can join them the
Devon ships have been worrying the Spaniards for two full hours into
confusion worse confounded

But what is that heavy firing behind them Alas for the great galliasse
She lies like a huge stranded whale upon the sands where now stands
Calais pier and Amyas Preston the future hero of La Guayra is
pounding her into submission while a fleet of hoys and drumblers look
on and help as jackals might the lion

Soon on the southwest horizon loom up larger and larger two mighty
ships and behind them sail on sail As they near a shout greets the
Triumph and the Bear and on and in the lord high admiral glides stately
into the thickest of the fight

True we have still but some threeandtwenty ships which can cope at
all with some ninety of the Spaniards but we have dash and daring and
the inspiration of utter need Now or never must the mighty struggle
be ended We worried them off Portland we must rend them in pieces
now and in rushes ship after ship to smash her broadsides through and
through the wooden castles sometimes not a pikes length asunder
and then out again to reload and give place meanwhile to another The
smaller are fighting with all sails set the few larger who once in
are careless about coming out again fight with topsails loose and
their main and foreyards close down on deck to prevent being boarded
The duke Oquenda and Recalde having with much ado got clear of the
shallows bear the brunt of the fight to seaward but in vain The day
goes against them more and more as it runs on Seymour and Winter have
battered the great San Philip into a wreck her masts are gone by the
board Pimentelli in the San Matthew comes up to take the mastiffs
off the fainting bull and finds them fasten on him instead but the
Evangelist though smaller is stouter than the Deacon and of all the
shot poured into him not twenty lackt him thorough His masts are
tottering but sink or strike he will not

Go ahead and pound his tough hide Leigh roars Drake off the poop
of his ship while he hammers away at one of the great galliasses What
right has he to keep us all waiting

Amyas slips in as best he can between Drake and Winter as he passes he
shouts to his ancient enemy

We are with you sir all friends today and slipping round Winters
bows he pours his broadside into those of the San Matthew and then
glides on to reload but not to return For not a pistol shot to
leeward worried by three or four small craft lies an immense galleon
and on her poopcan he believe his eyes for joythe maiden and the
wheel which he has sought so long

There he is shouts Amyas springing to the starboard side of the
ship The men too have already caught sight of that hated sign a
cheer of fury bursts from every throat

Steady men says Amyas in a suppressed voice Not a shot Reload
and be ready I must speak with him first and silent as the grave
amid the infernal din the Vengeance glides up to the Spaniards
quarter

Don Guzman Maria Magdalena Sotomayor de Soto shouts Amyas from the
mizzen rigging loud and clear amid the roar

He has not called in vain Fearless and graceful as ever the tall
mailclad figure of his foe leaps up upon the pooprailing twenty feet
above Amyass head and shouts through his vizor

At your service sir whosoever you may be

A dozen muskets and arrows are levelled at him but Amyas frowns them
down No man strikes him but I Spare him if you kill every other soul
on board Don Guzman I am Captain Sir Amyas Leigh I proclaim you a
traitor and a ravisher and challenge you once more to single combat
when and where you will

You are welcome to come on board me sir answers the Spaniard in a
clear quiet tone bringing with you this answer that you lie in your
throat and lingering a moment out of bravado to arrange his scarf he
steps slowly down again behind the bulwarks

Coward shouts Amyas at the top of his voice

The Spaniard reappears instantly Why that name senor of all
others asks he in a cool stern voice

Because we call men cowards in England who leave their wives to be
burnt alive by priests

The moment the words had passed Amyass lips he felt that they were
cruel and unjust But it was too late to recall them The Spaniard
started clutched his swordhilt and then hissed back through his
closed vizor

For that word sirrah you hang at my yardarm if Saint Mary gives me
grace

See that your halter be a silken one then laughed Amyas for I
am just dubbed knight And he stepped down as a storm of bullets rang
through the rigging round his head the Spaniards are not as punctilious
as he

Fire His ordnance crash through the sternworks of the Spaniard and
then he sails onward while her balls go humming harmlessly through his
rigging

Halfanhour has passed of wild noise and fury three times has the
Vengeance as a dolphin might sailed clean round and round the Sta
Catharina pouring in broadside after broadside till the guns are
leaping to the deckbeams with their own heat and the Spaniards sides
are slit and spotted in a hundred places And yet so high has been his
fire in return and so strong the deck defences of the Vengeance that a
few spars broken and two or three men wounded by musketry are all her
loss But still the Spaniard endures magnificent as ever it is the
battle of the thresher and the whale the end is certain but the work
is long

Can I help you Captain Leigh asked Lord Henry Seymour as he passes
within oars length of him to attack a ship ahead The San Matthew has
had his dinner and is gone on to Medina to ask for a digestive to it

I thank your lordship but this is my private quarrel of which I
spoke But if your lordship could lend me powder

Would that I could But so I fear says every other gentleman in the
fleet

A puff of wind clears away the sulphurous veil for a moment the sea is
clear of ships towards the land the Spanish fleet are moving again up
Channel Medina bringing up the rear only some two miles to their right
hand the vast hull of the San Philip is drifting up the shore with the
tide and somewhat nearer the San Matthew is hard at work at her pumps
They can see the white stream of water pouring down her side

Go in my lord and have the pair shouts Amyas

No sir Forward is a Seymours cry We will leave them to pay the
Flushingers expenses And on went Lord Henry and on shore went the
San Philip at Ostend to be plundered by the Flushingers while the
San Matthew whose captain on a hault courage had refused to save
himself and his gentlemen on board Medinas ship went blundering
miserably into the hungry mouths of Captain Peter Vanderduess and four
other valiant Dutchmen who like prudent men of Holland contrived to
keep the galleon afloat till they had emptied her and then hung up her
banner in the great church of Leyden being of such a length that being
fastened to the roof it reached unto the very ground

But in the meanwhile long ere the sun had set comes down the darkness
of the thunderstorm attracted as to a volcanos mouth to that vast
mass of sulphursmoke which cloaks the sea for many a mile and heavens
artillery above makes answer to mans below But still through smoke
and rain Amyas clings to his prey She too has seen the northward
movement of the Spanish fleet and sets her topsails Amyas calls to
the men to fire high and cripple her rigging but in vain for three or
four belated galleys having forced their way at last over the shallows
come flashing and sputtering up to the combatants and take his fire
off the galleon Amyas grinds his teeth and would fain hustle into the
thick of the press once more in spite of the galleys beaks

Most heroical captain says cary pulling a long face if we do we
are stove and sunk in five minutes not to mention that Yeo says he has
not twenty rounds of great cartridge left

So surely and silent the Vengeance sheers off but keeps as near
as she can to the little squadron all through the night of rain and
thunder which follows Next morning the sun rises on a clear sky with
a strong westnorthwest breeze and all hearts are asking what the day
will bring forth

They are long past Dunkirk now the German Ocean is opening before them
The Spaniards sorely battered and lessened in numbers have during
the night regained some sort of order The English hang on their skirts
a mile or two behind They have no ammunition and must wait for more
To Amyass great disgust the Sta Catharina has rejoined her fellows
during the night

Never mind says Cary she can neither dive nor fly and as long as
she is above water weWhat is the admiral about

He is signalling Lord Henry Seymour and his squadron Soon they
tack and come down the wind for the coast of Flanders Parma must be
blockaded still and the Hollanders are likely to be too busy with their
plunder to do it effectually Suddenly there is a stir in the Spanish
fleet Medina and the rearmost ships turn upon the English What can it
mean Will they offer battle once more If so it were best to get
out of their way for we have nothing wherewith to fight them So the
English lie close to the wind They will let them pass and return to
their old tactic of following and harassing

Goodbye to Seymour says Cary if he is caught between them and
Parmas flotilla They are going to Dunkirk

Impossible They will not have water enough to reach his light craft
Here comes a big ship right upon us Give him all you have left lads
and if he will fight us lay him alongside and die boarding

They gave him what they had and hulled him with every shot but his
huge side stood silent as the grave He had not wherewithal to return
the compliment

As I live he is cutting loose the foot of his mainsail the villain
means to run

There go the rest of them Victoria shouted Cary as one after
another every Spaniard set all the sail he could

There was silence for a few minutes throughout the English fleet
and then cheer upon cheer of triumph rent the skies It was over The
Spaniard had refused battle and thinking only of safety was pressing
downward toward the Straits again The Invincible Armada had cast away
its name and England was saved

But he will never get there sir said old Yeo who had come upon deck
to murmur his Nunc Domine and gaze upon that sight beyond all human
faith or hope Never never will he weather the Flanders shore against
such a breeze as is coming up Look to the eye of the wind sir and see
how the Lord is fighting for His people

Yes down it came fresher and stiffer every minute out of the gray
northwest as it does so often after a thunderstorm and the sea began
to rise high and white under the Claro Aquilone till the Spaniards
were fain to take in all spare canvas and lieto as best they could
while the English fleet lyingto also awaited an event which was in
Gods hands and not in theirs

They will be all ashore on Zealand before the afternoon murmured
Amyas and I have lost my labor Oh for powder powder powder to go
in and finish it at once

Oh sir said Yeo dont murmur against the Lord in the very day of
His mercies It is hard to be sure but His will be done

Could we not borrow powder from Drake there

Look at the sea sir

And indeed the sea was far too rough for any such attempt The
Spaniards neared and neared the fatal dunes which fringed the shore for
many a dreary mile and Amyas had to wait weary hours growling like a
dog who has had the bone snatched out of his mouth till the day wore
on when behold the wind began to fall as rapidly as it had risen A
savage joy rose in Amyass heart

They are safe safe for us Who will go and beg us powder A cartridge
here and a cartridge thereanything to set to work again

Cary volunteered and returned in a couple of hours with some quantity
but he was on board again only just in time for the southwester had
recovered the mastery of the skies and Spaniards and English were
moving away but this time northward Whither now To Scotland Amyas
knew not and cared not provided he was in the company of Don Guzman de
Soto

The Armada was defeated and England saved But such great undertakings
seldom end in one grand melodramatic explosion of fireworks through
which the devil arises in full roar to drag Dr Faustus forever into the
flaming pit On the contrary the devil stands by his servants to the
last and tries to bring off his shattered forces with drums beating and
colors flying and if possible to lull his enemies into supposing that
the fight is ended long before it really is half over All which the
good Lord Howard of Effingham knew well and knew too that Medina had
one last card to play and that was the filial affection of that dutiful
and chivalrous son James of Scotland True he had promised faith to
Elizabeth but that was no reason why he should keep it He had been
hankering and dabbling after Spain for years past for its absolution
was dear to his inmost soul and Queen Elizabeth had had to warn him
scold him call him a liar for so doing so the Armada might still find
shelter and provision in the Firth of Forth But whether Lord Howard
knew or not Medina did not know that Elizabeth had played her card
cunningly in the shape of one of those appeals to the purse which to
Jamess dying day overweighed all others save appeals to his vanity
The title of a dukedom in England a yearly pension of 5000 pounds a
guard at the queens charge and other matters probably more hounds
and deer had steeled the heart of the King of Scots and sealed the
Firth of Forth Nevertheless as I say Lord Howard like the rest of
Elizabeths heroes trusted James just as much as James trusted others
and therefore thought good to escort the Armada until it was safely past
the domains of that most chivalrous and truthful Solomon But on the
4th of August his fears such as they were were laid to rest The
Spaniards left the Scottish coast and sailed away for Norway and the
game was played out and the end was come as the end of such matters
generally comes by gradual decay petty disaster and mistake till
the snowmountain instead of being blown tragically and heroically to
atoms melts helplessly and pitiably away



CHAPTER XXXII

HOW AMYAS THREW HIS SWORD INTO THE SEA

 Full fathom deep thy father lies
 Of his bones are corals made
 Those are pearls which were his eyes
 Nothing of him that doth fade
 But doth suffer a seachange
 Into something rich and strange
 Fairies hourly ring his knell
 Hark I hear them Ding dong bell

 The Tempest

Yes it is over and the great Armada is vanquished It is lulled for
awhile the everlasting war which is in heaven the battle of Iran and
Turan of the children of light and of darkness of Michael and his
angels against Satan and his fiends the battle which slowly and seldom
once in the course of many centuries culminates and ripens into a
day of judgment and becomes palpable and incarnate no longer a mere
spiritual fight but one of flesh and blood wherein simple men may
choose their sides without mistake and help Gods cause not merely with
prayer and pen but with sharp shot and cold steel A day of judgment
has come which has divided the light from the darkness and the sheep
from the goats and tried each mans work by the fire and behold the
devils work like its maker is proved to have been as always a lie
and a sham and a windy boast a bladder which collapses at the merest
pinprick Byzantine empires Spanish Armadas triplecrowned papacies
Russian despotisms this is the way of them and will be to the end of
the world One brave blow at the big bullying phantom and it vanishes
in sulphurstench while the children of Israel as of old see the
Egyptians dead on the seashorethey scarce know how save that God
has done it and sing the song of Moses and of the Lamb

And now from England and the Netherlands from Germany and Geneva and
those poor Vaudois shepherdsaints whose bones for generations past

 Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold

to be indeed the seed of the Church and a germ of new life liberty
and civilization even in these very days returning good for evil to
that Piedmont which has hunted them down like the partridges on the
mountainsfrom all of Europe from all of mankind I had almost said
in which lay the seed of future virtue and greatness of the destinies
of the newdiscovered world and the triumphs of the coming age of
science arose a shout of holy joy such as the world had not heard
for many a weary and bloody century a shout which was the prophetic
birthpaean of North America Australia New Zealand the Pacific
Islands of free commerce and free colonization over the whole earth

There was in England by the commandment of her majesty says Van
Meteran and likewise in the United Provinces by the direction of the
States a solemn festival day publicly appointed wherein all persons
were solemnly enjoined to resort unto ye Church and there to render
thanks and praises unto God and ye preachers were commanded to exhort
ye people thereunto The aforesaid solemnity was observed upon the 29th
of November which day was wholly spent in fasting prayer and giving
of thanks

Likewise the Queens Majesty herself imitating ye ancient Romans rode
into London in triumph in regard of her own and her subjects glorious
deliverance For being attended upon very solemnly by all ye principal
Estates and officers of her Realm she was carried through her said City
of London in a triumphant Chariot and in robes of triumph from her
Palace unto ye said Cathedral Church of St Paul out of ye which ye
Ensigns and Colours of ye vanquished Spaniards hung displayed And
all ye Citizens of London in their liveries stood on either side ye
street by their several Companies with their ensigns and banners and
the streets were hanged on both sides with blue Cloth which together
with ye foresaid banners yielded a very stately and gallant prospect
Her Majestie being entered into ye Church together with her Clergy and
Nobles gave thanks unto God and caused a public Sermon to be preached
before her at Pauls Cross wherein none other argument was handled
but that praise honour and glory might be rendered unto God and that
Gods Name might be extolled by thanksgiving And with her own princely
voice she most Christianly exhorted ye people to do ye same whereunto
ye people with a loud acclamation wished her a most long and happy
life to ye confusion of her foes

Yes as the medals struck on the occasion said It came it saw and it
fled And whither Away and northward like a herd of frightened deer
past the Orkneys and Shetlands catching up a few hapless fishermen as
guides past the coast of Norway there too refused water and food by
the brave descendants of the Vikings and on northward ever towards the
lonely Faroes and the everlasting dawn which heralds round the Pole the
midnight sun

Their water is failing the cattle must go overboard and the wild
northern sea echoes to the shrieks of drowning horses They must
homeward at least somehow each as best he can Let them meet again
at Cape Finisterre if indeed they ever meet Medina Sidonia with some
fiveand twenty of the soundest and best victualled ships will lead
the way and leave the rest to their fate He is soon out of sight and
forty more the only remnant of that mighty host come wandering wearily
behind hoping to make the southwest coast of Ireland and have help
or at least fresh water there from their fellow Romanists Alas for
them

 Make Thou their way dark and slippery
 And follow them up ever with Thy storm

For now comes up from the Atlantic gale on gale and few of that
hapless remnant reached the shores of Spain

And where are Amyas and the Vengeance all this while

At the fiftyseventh degree of latitude the English fleet finding
themselves growing short of provision and having been long since out of
powder and ball turn southward toward home thinking it best to leave
the Spaniard to those uncouth and boisterous northern seas A few
pinnaces are still sent onward to watch their course and the English
fleet caught in the same storms which scattered the Spaniards with
great danger and industry reached Harwich port and there provide
themselves of victuals and ammunition in case the Spaniards should
return but there is no need for that caution Parma indeed who cannot
believe that the idol at Halle after all his compliments to it will
play him so scurvy a trick will watch for weeks on Dunkirk dunes
hoping against hope for the Armadas return casting anchors and
spinning rigging to repair their losses

 But lang lang may his ladies sit
 With their fans intill their hand
 Before they see Sir Patrick Spens
 Come sailing to the land

The Armada is away on the other side of Scotland and Amyas is following
in its wake

For when the lord high admiral determined to return Amyas asked
leave to follow the Spaniard and asked too of Sir John Hawkins
who happened to be at hand such ammunition and provision as could be
afforded him promising to repay the same like an honest man out of
his plunder if he lived out of his estate if he died lodging for that
purpose bills in the hands of Sir John who as a man of business
took them and put them in his pocket among the thimbles string and
tobacco after which Amyas calling his men together reminded them once
more of the story of the Rose of Torridge and Don Guzman de Soto and
then asked

Men of Bideford will you follow me There will be plunder for those
who love plunder revenge for those who love revenge and for all of us
for we all love honor the honor of having never left the chase as long
as there was a Spanish flag in English seas

And every soul on board replied that they would follow Sir Amyas Leigh
around the world

There is no need for me to detail every incident of that long and weary
chase how they found the Sta Catharina attacked her and had to sheer
off she being rescued by the rest how when Medinas squadron left the
crippled ships behind they were all but taken or sunk by thrusting
into the midst of the Spanish fleet to prevent her escaping with Medina
how they crippled her so that she could not beat to windward out into
the ocean but was fain to run south past the Orkneys and down through
the Minch between Cape Wrath and Lewis how the younger hands were
ready to mutiny because Amyas in his stubborn haste ran past two or
three noble prizes which were all but disabled among others one of
the great galliasses and the two great Venetians La Ratta and La
Belanzarawhich were afterwards with more than thirty other vessels
wrecked on the west coast of Ireland how he got fresh water in spite
of certain Hebridean Scots of Skye who after reviling him in an
unknown tongue fought with him awhile and then embraced him and his
men with howls of affection and were not much more decently clad nor
more civilized than his old friends of California how he pacified his
men by letting them pick the bones of a great Venetian which was going
on shore upon Islay by which they got booty enough to repay them for
the whole voyage and offended them again by refusing to land and
plunder two great Spanish wrecks on the Mull of Cantire whose crews by
the by James tried to smuggle off secretly into Spain in ships of his
own wishing to play as usual both sides of the game at once but
the Spaniards were stopped at Yarmouth till the councils pleasure was
knownwhich was of course to let the poor wretches go on their way
and be hanged elsewhere how they passed a strange island half black
half white which the wild people called Raghary but Cary christened it
the drowned magpie how the Sta Catharina was near lost on the Isle
of Man and then put into Castleton where the Manxmen slew a whole
boatscrew with their arrows and then put out again when Amyas
fought with her a whole day and shot away her mainyard how the
Spaniard blundered down the coast of Wales not knowing whither he went
how they were both nearly lost on Holyhead and again on Bardsey Island
how they got on a lee shore in Cardigan Bay before a heavy westerly
gale and the Sta Catharina ran aground on Sarn David one of those
strange subaqueous pebbledykes which are said to be the remnants of the
lost land of Gwalior destroyed by the carelessness of Prince Seithenin
the drunkard at whose name each loyal Welshman spits how she got off
again at the rising of the tide and fought with Amyas a fourth time
how the wind changed and she got round St Davids Headthese and
many more moving incidents of this eventful voyage I must pass over
without details and go on to the end for it is time that the end
should come

It was now the sixteenth day of the chase They had seen the evening
before St Davids Head and then the Welsh coast round Milford
Haven looming out black and sharp before the blaze of the inland
thunderstorm and it had lightened all round them during the fore part
of the night upon a light southwestern breeze

In vain they had strained their eyes through the darkness to catch by
the fitful glare of the flashes the tall masts of the Spaniard Of
one thing at least they were certain that with the wind as it was she
could not have gone far to the westward and to attempt to pass them
again and go northward was more than she dare do She was probably
lyingto ahead of them perhaps between them and the land and when a
little after midnight the wind chopped up to the west and blew stiffly
till day break they felt sure that unless she had attempted the
desperate expedient of running past them they had her safe in the mouth
of the Bristol Channel Slowly and wearily broke the dawn on such a day
as often follows heavy thunder a sunless drizzly day roofed with low
dingy cloud barred and netted and festooned with black a sign that
the storm is only taking breath awhile before it bursts again while all
the narrow horizon is dim and spongy with vapor drifting before a chilly
breeze As the day went on the breeze died down and the sea fell to a
long glassy foamflecked roll while overhead brooded the inky sky and
round them the leaden mist shut out alike the shore and the chase

Amyas paced the sloppy deck fretfully and fiercely He knew that the
Spaniard could not escape but he cursed every moment which lingered
between him and that one great revenge which blackened all his soul
The men sate sulkily about the deck and whistled for a wind the sails
flapped idly against the masts and the ship rolled in the long troughs
of the sea till her yardarms almost dipped right and left

Take care of those guns You will have something loose next growled
Amyas

We will take care of the guns if the Lord will take care of the wind
said Yeo

We shall have plenty before night said Cary and thunder too

So much the better said Amyas It may roar till it splits the
heavens if it does but let me get my work done

Hes not far off I warrant said Cary One lift of the cloud and we
should see him

To windward of us as likely as not said Amyas The devil fights
for him I believe To have been on his heels sixteen days and not sent
this through him yet And he shook his sword impatiently

So the morning wore away without a sign of living thing not even a
passing gull and the black melancholy of the heaven reflected itself
in the black melancholy of Amyas Was he to lose his prey after all
The thought made him shudder with rage and disappointment It was
intolerable Anything but that

No God he cried let me but once feel this in his accursed heart
and thenstrike me dead if Thou wilt

The Lord have mercy on us cried John Brimblecombe What have you
said

What is that to you sir There they are piping to dinner Go down I
shall not come

And Jack went down and talked in a halfterrified whisper of Amyass
ominous words

All thought that they portended some bad luck except old Yeo

Well Sir John said he and why not What better can the Lord do
for a man than take him home when he has done his work Our captain is
wilful and spiteful and must needs kill his man himself while for me
I dont care how the Don goes provided he does go I owe him no grudge
nor any man May the Lord give him repentance and forgive him all his
sins but if I could but see him once safe ashore as he may be ere
nightfall on the Mortestone or the back of Lundy I would say Lord
now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace even if it were the
lightning which was sent to fetch me

But master Yeo a sudden death

And why not a sudden death Sir John Even fools long for a short life
and a merry one and shall not the Lords people pray for a short death
and a merry one Let it come as it will to old Yeo Hark theres the
captains voice

Here she is thundered Amyas from the deck and in an instant all were
scrambling up the hatchway as fast as the frantic rolling of the ship
would let them

Yes There she was The cloud had lifted suddenly and to the south a
ragged bore of blue sky let a long stream of sunshine down on her tall
masts and stately hull as she lay rolling some four or five miles to
the eastward but as for land none was to be seen

There she is and here we are said Cary but where is here and
where is there How is the tide master

Running up Channel by this time sir

What matters the tide said Amyas devouring the ship with terrible
and cold blue eyes Cant we get at her

Not unless some one jumps out and shoves behind said Cary I shall
down again and finish that mackerel if this roll has not chucked it to
the cockroaches under the table

Dont jest Will I cant stand it said Amyas in a voice which
quivered so much that Cary looked at him His whole frame was trembling
like an aspen Cary took his arm and drew him aside

Dear old lad said he as they leaned over the bulwarks what is
this You are not yourself and have not been these four days

No I am not Amyas Leigh I am my brothers avenger Do not reason
with me Will when it is over I shall be merry old Amyas again and he
passed his hand over his brow

Do you believe said he after a moment that men can be possessed by
devils

The Bible says so

If my cause were not a just one I should fancy I had a devil in me My
throat and heart are as hot as the pit Would to God it were done for
done it must be Now go

Cary went away with a shudder As he passed down the hatchway he looked
back Amyas had got the hone out of his pocket and was whetting away
again at his swordedge as if there was some dreadful doom on him to
whet and whet forever

The weary day wore on The strip of blue sky was curtained over again
and all was dismal as before though it grew sultrier every moment and
now and then a distant mutter shook the air to westward Nothing could
be done to lessen the distance between the ships for the Vengeance had
had all her boats carried away but one and that was much too small
to tow her and while the men went down again to finish dinner Amyas
worked on at his sword looking up every now and then suddenly at the
Spaniard as if to satisfy himself that it was not a vision which had
vanished

About two Yeo came up to him

He is ours safely now sir The tide has been running to the eastward
for this two hours

Safe as a fox in a trap Satan himself cannot take him from us

But God may said Brimblecombe simply

Who spoke to you sir If I thought that HeThere comes the thunder at
last

And as he spoke an angry growl from the westward heavens seemed to
answer his wild words and rolled and loudened nearer and nearer till
right over their heads it crashed against some cloudcliff far above
and all was still

Each man looked in the others face but Amyas was unmoved

The storm is coming said he and the wind in it It will be
Eastwardho now for once my merry men all

Eastwardho never brought us luck said Jack in an undertone to Cary
But by this time all eyes were turned to the northwest where a black
line along the horizon began to define the boundary of sea and air till
now all dim in mist

There comes the breeze

And there the storm too

And with that strangely accelerating pace which some storms seem to
possess the thunder which had been growling slow and seldom far away
now rang peal on peal along the cloudy floor above their heads

Here comes the breeze Round with the yards or we shall be taken
aback

The yards creaked round the sea grew crisp around them the hot air
swept their cheeks tightened every rope filled every sail bent her
over A cheer burst from the men as the helm went up and they staggered
away before the wind right down upon the Spaniard who lay still
becalmed

There is more behind Amyas said Cary Shall we not shorten sail a
little

No Hold on every stitch said Amyas Give me the helm man
Boatswain pipe away to clear for fight

It was done and in ten minutes the men were all at quarters while
the thunder rolled louder and louder overhead and the breeze freshened
fast

The dog has it now There he goes said Cary

Right before the wind He has no liking to face us

He is running into the jaws of destruction said Yeo An hour more
will send him either right up the Channel or smack on shore somewhere

There he has put his helm down I wonder if he sees land

He is like a March hare beat out of his country said Cary and dont
know whither to run next

Cary was right In ten minutes more the Spaniard fell off again and
went away dead down wind while the Vengeance gained on him fast
After two hours more the four miles had diminished to one while the
lightning flashed nearer and nearer as the storm came up and from the
vast mouth of a black cloudarch poured so fierce a breeze that Amyas
yielded unwillingly to hints which were growing into open murmurs and
bade shorten sail

On they rushed with scarcely lessened speed the black arch following
fast curtained by the flat gray sheet of pouring rain before which the
water was boiling in a long white line while every moment behind the
watery veil a keen blue spark leapt down into the sea or darted zigzag
through the rain

We shall have it now and with a vengeance this will try your tackle
master said Cary

The functionary answered with a shrug and turned up the collar of his
rough frock as the first drops flew stinging round his ears Another
minute and the squall burst full upon them in rain which cut like
hailhail which lashed the sea into froth and wind which whirled off
the heads of the surges and swept the waters into one white seething
waste And above them and behind them and before them the lightning
leapt and ran dazzling and blinding while the deep roar of the thunder
was changed to sharp earpiercing cracks

Get the arms and ammunition under cover and then below with you all
shouted Amyas from the helm

And heat the pokers in the galley fire said Yeo to be ready if the
rain puts our linstocks out I hope youll let me stay on deck sir in
case

I must have some one and who better than you Can you see the chase

No she was wrapped in the gray whirlwind She might be within half a
mile of them for aught they could have seen of her

And now Amyas and his old liegeman were alone Neither spoke each knew
the others thoughts and knew that they were his own The squall blew
fiercer and fiercer the rain poured heavier and heavier Where was the
Spaniard

If he has laidto we may overshoot him sir

If he has tried to layto he will not have a sail left in the
boltropes or perhaps a mast on deck I know the stiffneckedness of
those Spanish tubs Hurrah there he is right on our larboard bow

There she was indeed two musketshots off staggering away with canvas
split and flying

He has been trying to hull sir and caught a buffet said Yeo
rubbing his hands What shall we do now

Range alongside if it blow live imps and witches and try our luck
once more Pah how this lightning dazzles

On they swept gaining fast on the Spaniard Call the men up and to
quarters the rain will be over in ten minutes

Yeo ran forward to the gangway and sprang back again with a face white
and wild

Land right ahead Port your helm sir For the love of God port your
helm

Amyas with the strength of a bull jammed the helm down while Yeo
shouted to the men below

She swung round The masts bent like whips crack went the foresail
like a cannon What matter Within two hundred yards of them was the
Spaniard in front of her and above her a huge dark bank rose through
the dense hail and mingled with the clouds and at its foot plainer
every moment pillars and spouts of leaping foam

What is it Morte Hartland

It might be anything for thirty miles

Lundy said Yeo The south end I see the head of the Shutter in the
breakers Hard aport yet and get her closehauled as you can and the
Lord may have mercy on us still Look at the Spaniard

Yes look at the Spaniard

On their left hand as they broachedto the wall of granite sloped down
from the clouds toward an isolated peak of rock some two hundred feet
in height Then a hundred yards of roaring breaker upon a sunken shelf
across which the race of the tide poured like a cataract then amid a
column of salt smoke the Shutter like a huge black fang rose waiting
for its prey and between the Shutter and the land the great galleon
loomed dimly through the storm

He too had seen his danger and tried to broachto But his clumsy
mass refused to obey the helm he struggled a moment half hid in foam
fell away again and rushed upon his doom

Lost lost lost cried Amyas madly and throwing up his hands let go
the tiller Yeo caught it just in time

Sir sir What are you at We shall clear the rock yet

Yes shouted Amyas in his frenzy but he will not

Another minute The galleon gave a sudden jar and stopped Then one
long heave and bound as if to free herself And then her bows lighted
clean upon the Shutter

An awful silence fell on every English soul They heard not the roaring
of wind and surge they saw not the blinding flashes of the lightning
but they heard one long earpiercing wail to every saint in heaven rise
from five hundred human throats they saw the mighty ship heel over from
the wind and sweep headlong down the cataract of the race plunging her
yards into the foam and showing her whole black side even to her keel
till she rolled clean over and vanished for ever and ever

Shame cried Amyas hurling his sword far into the sea to lose my
right my right when it was in my very grasp Unmerciful

A crack which rent the sky and made the granite ring and quiver a
bright world of flame and then a blank of utter darkness against which
stood out glowing redhot every mast and sail and rock and Salvation
Yeo as he stood just in front of Amyas the tiller in his hand All
redhot transfigured into fire and behind the black black night

     

A whisper a rustling close beside him and Brimblecombes voice said
softly

Give him more wine Will his eyes are opening

Hey day said Amyas faintly not past the Shutter yet How long she
hangs in the wind

We are long past the Shutter Sir Amyas said Brimblecombe

Are you mad Cannot I trust my own eyes

There was no answer for awhile

We are past the Shutter indeed said Cary very gently and lying in
the cove at Lundy

Will you tell me that that is not the Shutter and that the
Devilslimekiln and that the cliffthat villain Spaniard only
goneand that Yeo is not standing here by me and Cary there forward
andwhy by the by where are you Jack Brimblecombe who were talking
to me this minute

Oh Sir Amyas Leigh dear Sir Amyas Leigh blubbered poor Jack put
out your hand and feel where you are and pray the Lord to forgive you
for your wilfulness

A great trembling fell upon Amyas Leigh half fearfully he put out his
hand he felt that he was in his hammock with the deck beams close
above his head The vision which had been left upon his eyeballs
vanished like a dream

What is this I must be asleep What has happened Where am I

In your cabin Amyas said Cary

What And where is Yeo

Yeo is gone where he longed to go and as he longed to go The same
flash which struck you down struck him dead

Dead Lightning Any more hurt I must go and see Why what is this
and Amyas passed his hand across his eyes It is all darkdark as I
live And he passed his hand over his eyes again

There was another dead silence Amyas broke it

Oh God shrieked the great proud seacaptain Oh God I am blind
blind blind And writhing in his great horror he called to Cary to
kill him and put him out of his misery and then wailed for his
mother to come and help him as if he had been a boy once more while
Brimblecombe and Cary and the sailors who crowded round the cabindoor
wept as if they too had been boys once more

Soon his fit of frenzy passed off and he sank back exhausted

They lifted him into their remaining boat rowed him ashore carried him
painfully up the hill to the old castle and made a bed for him on
the floor in the very room in which Don Guzman and Rose Salterne had
plighted their troth to each other five wild years before

Three miserable days were passed within that lonely tower Amyas
utterly unnerved by the horror of his misfortune and by the
overexcitement of the last few weeks was incessantly delirious while
Cary and Brimblecombe and the men nursed him by turns as sailors
and wives only can nurse and listened with awe to his piteous
selfreproaches and entreaties to Heaven to remove that woe which
as he shrieked again and again was a just judgment on him for his
wilfulness and ferocity The surgeon talked of course learnedly about
melancholic humors and his livers being adust by the overpungency
of the animal spirits and then fell back on the universal panacea of
bloodletting which he effected with fear and trembling during a short
interval of prostration encouraged by which he attempted to administer
a large bolus of aloes was knocked down for his pains and then thought
it better to leave Nature to her own work In the meanwhile Cary had
sent off one of the island skiffs to Clovelly with letters to his
father and to Mrs Leigh entreating the latter to come off to the
island but the heavy westerly winds made that as impossible as it was
to move Amyas on board and the men had to do their best and did it
well enough

On the fourth day his raving ceased but he was still too weak to be
moved Toward noon however he called for food ate a little and
seemed revived

Will he said after awhile this room is as stifling as it is dark
I feel as if I should be a sound man once more if I could but get one
snuff of the seabreeze

The surgeon shook his head at the notion of moving him but Amyas was
peremptory

I am captain still Tom Surgeon and will sail for the Indies if I
choose Will Cary Jack Brimblecombe will you obey a blind general

What you will in reason said they both at once

Then lead me out my masters and over the down to the south end
To the point at the south end I must go there is no other place will
suit

And he rose firmly to his feet and held out his hands for theirs

Let him have his humor whispered Cary It may be the working off of
his madness

This sudden strength is a note of fresh fever Mr Lieutenant
said the surgeon and the rules of the art prescribe rather a fresh
bloodletting

Amyas overheard the last word and broke out

Thou pigsticking Philistine wilt thou make sport with blind Samson
Come near me to let blood from my arm and see if I do not let blood
from thy coxcomb Catch him Will and bring him me here

The surgeon vanished as the blind giant made a step forward and they
set forth Amyas walking slowly but firmly between his two friends

Whither asked Cary

To the south end The crag above the Devilslimekiln No other place
will suit

Jack gave a murmur and halfstopped as a frightful suspicion crossed
him

That is a dangerous place

What of that said Amyas who caught his meaning in his tone Dost
think I am going to leap over cliff I have not heart enough for that
On lads and set me safe among the rocks

So slowly and painfully they went on while Amyas murmured to himself

No no other place will suit I can see all thence

So on they went to the point where the cyclopean wall of granite cliff
which forms the western side of Lundy ends sheer in a precipice of some
three hundred feet topped by a pile of snowwhite rock bespangled with
golden lichens As they approached a raven who sat upon the topmost
stone black against the bright blue sky flapped lazily away and sank
down the abysses of the cliff as if he scented the corpses underneath
the surge Below them from the Gullrock rose a thousand birds and
filled the air with sound the choughs cackled the hacklets wailed
the great blackbacks laughed querulous defiance at the intruders and a
single falcon with an angry bark dashed out from beneath their feet
and hung poised high aloft watching the seafowl which swung slowly
round and round below

It was a glorious sight upon a glorious day To the northward the glens
rushed down toward the cliff crowned with gray crags and carpeted with
purple heather and green fern and from their feet stretched away to
the westward the sapphire rollers of the vast Atlantic crowned with a
thousand crests of flying foam On their left hand some ten miles to
the south stood out against the sky the purple wall of Hartland cliffs
sinking lower and lower as they trended away to the southward along the
lonely ironbound shores of Cornwall until they faded dim and blue
into the blue horizon forty miles away

The sky was flecked with clouds which rushed toward them fast upon the
roaring southwest wind and the warm oceanbreeze swept up the cliffs
and whistled through the heatherbells and howled in cranny and in
crag

 Till the pillars and clefts of the granite
 Rang like a Godswept lyre

while Amyas a proud smile upon his lips stood breasting that genial
stream of airy wine with swelling nostrils and fastheaving chest
and seemed to drink in life from every gust All three were silent for
awhile and Jack and Cary gazing downward with delight upon the glory
and the grandeur of the sight forgot for awhile that their companion
saw it not Yet when they started sadly and looked into his face did
he not see it So wide and eager were his eyes so bright and calm his
face that they fancied for an instant that he was once more even as
they

A deep sigh undeceived them I know it is all herethe dear old sea
where I would live and die And my eyes feel for it feel for itand
cannot find it never never will find it again forever Gods will be
done

Do you say that asked Brimblecombe eagerly

Why should I not Why have I been raving in hellfire for I know not
how many days but to find out that John Brimblecombe thou better man
than I

Not that last but Amen Amen and the Lord has indeed had mercy upon
thee said Jack through his honest tears

Amen said Amyas Now set me where I can rest among the rocks
without fear of fallingfor life is sweet still even without eyes
friendsand leave me to myself awhile

It was no easy matter to find a safe place for from the foot of the
crag the heathery turf slopes down all but upright on one side to a
cliff which overhangs a shoreless cove of deep dark sea and on the
other to an abyss even more hideous where the solid rock has sunk away
and opened inland in the hillside a smoothwalled pit some sixty feet
square and some hundred and fifty in depth aptly known then as now
as the Devilslimekiln the mouth of which as old wives say was once
closed by the Shutterrock itself till the fiend in malice hurled it
into the sea to be a pest to mariners A narrow and untrodden cavern at
the bottom connects it with the outer sea they could even then hear the
mysterious thunder and gurgle of the surge in the subterranean adit
as it rolled huge boulders to and fro in darkness and forced before it
gusts of pentup air It was a spot to curdle weak blood and to make
weak heads reel but all the fitter on that account for Amyas and his
fancy

You can sit here as in an armchair said Cary helping him down to
one of those square natural seats so common in the granite tors

Good now turn my face to the Shutter Be sure and exact So Do I face
it full

Full said Cary

Then I need no eyes wherewith to see what is before me said he with
a sad smile I know every stone and every headland and every wave too
I may say far beyond aught that eye can reach Now go and leave me
alone with God and with the dead

They retired a little space and watched him He never stirred for many
minutes then leaned his elbows on his knees and his head upon his
hands and so was still again He remained so long thus that the pair
became anxious and went towards him He was asleep and breathing quick
and heavily

He will take a fever said Brimblecombe if he sleeps much longer
with his head down in the sunshine

We must wake him gently if we wake him at all And Cary moved forward
to him

As he did so Amyas lifted his head and turning it to right and left
felt round him with his sightless eyes

You have been asleep Amyas

Have I I have not slept back my eyes then Take up this great useless
carcase of mine and lead me home I shall buy me a dog when I get to
Burrough I think and make him tow me in a string eh So Give me your
hand Now march

His guides heard with surprise this new cheerfulness

Thank God sir that your heart is so light already said good Jack
it makes me feel quite upraised myself like

I have reason to be cheerful Sir John I have left a heavy load behind
me I have been wilful and proud and a blasphemer and swollen with
cruelty and pride and God has brought me low for it and cut me off
from my evil delight No more Spaniardhunting for me now my masters
God will send no such fools as I upon His errands

You do not repent of fighting the Spaniards

Not I but of hating even the worst of them Listen to me Will and
Jack If that man wronged me I wronged him likewise I have been a
fiend when I thought myself the grandest of men yea a very avenging
angel out of heaven But God has shown me my sin and we have made up
our quarrel forever

Made it up

Made it up thank God But I am weary Set me down awhile and I will
tell you how it befell

Wondering they set him down upon the heather while the bees hummed
round them in the sun and Amyas felt for a hand of each and clasped it
in his own hand and began

When you left me there upon the rock lads I looked away and out to
sea to get one last snuff of the merry seabreeze which will never
sail me again And as I looked I tell you truth I could see the water
and the sky as plain as ever I saw them till I thought my sight was
come again But soon I knew it was not so for I saw more than man could
see right over the ocean as I live and away to the Spanish Main And
I saw Barbados and Grenada and all the isles that we ever sailed by
and La Guayra in Caracas and the Silla and the house beneath it where
she lived And I saw him walking with her on the barbecue and he loved
her then I saw what I saw and he loved her and I say he loves her
still

Then I saw the cliffs beneath me and the Gullrock and the Shutter
and the Ledge I saw them William Cary and the weeds beneath the merry
blue sea And I saw the grand old galleon Will she has righted with
the sweeping of the tide She lies in fifteen fathoms at the edge of
the rocks upon the sand and her men are all lying around her asleep
until the judgmentday

Cary and Jack looked at him and then at each other His eyes were
clear and bright and full of meaning and yet they knew that he
was blind His voice was shaping itself into a song Was he inspired
Insane What was it And they listened with awestruck faces as the
giant pointed down into the blue depths far below and went on

And I saw him sitting in his cabin like a valiant gentleman of Spain
and his officers were sitting round him with their swords upon the
table at the wine And the prawns and the crayfish and the rockling
they swam in and out above their heads but Don Guzman he never heeded
but sat still and drank his wine Then he took a locket from his bosom
and I heard him speak Will and he said Heres the picture of my fair
and true lady drink to her senors all Then he spoke to me Will
and called me right up through the oarweed and the sea We have had
a fair quarrel senor it is time to be friends once more My wife and
your brother have forgiven me so your honor takes no stain And I
answered We are friends Don Guzman God has judged our quarrel and
not we Then he said I sinned and I am punished And I said And
senor so am I Then he held out his hand to me Cary and I stooped to
take it and awoke

He ceased and they looked in his face again It was exhausted but
clear and gentle like the face of a newborn babe Gradually his head
dropped upon his breast again he was either swooning or sleeping and
they had much ado to get him home There he lay for eightandforty
hours in a quiet doze then arose suddenly called for food ate
heartily and seemed saving his eyesight as whole and sound as ever
The surgeon bade them get him home to Northam as soon as possible
and he was willing enough to go So the next day the Vengeance sailed
leaving behind a dozen men to seize and keep in the queens name any
goods which should be washed up from the wreck



CHAPTER XXXIII

HOW AMYAS LET THE APPLE FALL

 Would you hear a Spanish lady
 How she wood an Englishman
 Garments gay and rich as may be
 Deckd with jewels had she on

 Elizabethan Ballad

It was the first of October The morning was bright and still the skies
were dappled modestly from east to west with soft gray autumn cloud as
if all heaven and earth were resting after those fearful summer months
of battle and of storm Silently as if ashamed and sad the Vengeance
slid over the bar and passed the sleeping sandhills and dropped her
anchor off Appledore with her flag floating halfmast high for the
corpse of Salvation Yeo was on board

A boat pulled off from the ship and away to the western end of the
strand and Cary and Brimblecombe helped out Amyas Leigh and led him
slowly up the hill toward his home

The crowd clustered round him with cheers and blessings and sobs of
pity from kindhearted women for all in Appledore and Bideford knew
well by this time what had befallen him

Spare me my good friends said Amyas I have landed here that I
might go quietly home without passing through the town and being made
a gazingstock Think not of me good folks nor talk of me but come
behind me decently as Christian men and follow to the grave the body
of a better man than I

And as he spoke another boat came off and in it covered with the
flag of England the body of Salvation Yeo

The people took Amyas at his word and a man was sent on to Burrough to
tell Mrs Leigh that her son was coming When the coffin was landed
and lifted Amyas and his friends took their places behind it as chief
mourners and the crew followed in order while the crowd fell in behind
them and gathered every moment till ere they were halfway to Northam
town the funeral train might number full five hundred souls

They had sent over by a fishingskiff the day before to bid the sexton
dig the grave and when they came into the churchyard the parson stood
ready waiting at the gate

Mrs Leigh stayed quietly at home for she had no heart to face the
crowd and though her heart yearned for her son yet she was well
content when was she not content that he should do honor to his
ancient and faithful servant so she sat down in the baywindow with
Ayacanora by her side and when the tolling of the bell ceased she
opened her Prayerbook and began to read the Burialservice

Ayacanora she said they are burying old Master Yeo who loved you
and sought you over the wide wide world and saved you from the teeth
of the crocodile Are you not sorry for him child that you look so gay
today

Ayacanora blushed and hung down her head she was thinking of nothing
poor child but Amyas

The Burialservice was done the blessing said the parson drew back
but the people lingered and crowded round to look at the coffin while
Amyas stood still at the head of the grave It had been dug by his
command at the west end of the church near by the foot of the tall
gray windswept tower which watches for a beacon far and wide over land
and sea Perhaps the old man might like to look at the sea and see
the ships come out and in across the bar and hear the wind on winter
nights roar through the belfry far above his head Why not It was but
a fancy and yet Amyas felt that he too should like to be buried in such
a place so Yeo might like it also

Still the crowd lingered and looked first at the grave and then at
the blind giant who stood over it as if they felt by instinct that
something more ought to come And something more did come Amyas drew
himself up to his full height and waved his hand majestically as one
about to speak while the eyes of all men were fastened on him

Twice he essayed to begin and twice the words were choked upon his
lips and then

Good people all and seamen among whom I was bred and to whom I come
home blind this day to dwell with you till deathHere lieth the flower
and pattern of all bold mariners the truest of friends and the most
terrible of foes unchangeable of purpose crafty of council and swift
of execution in triumph most sober in failure as God knows I have
found full many a day of endurance beyond mortal man Who first of all
Britons helped to humble the pride of the Spaniard at Rio de la Hacha
and Nombre and first of all sailed upon those South Seas which shall
be hereafter by Gods grace as free to English keels as is the bay
outside Who having afterwards been purged from his youthful sins by
strange afflictions and torments unspeakable suffered at the hands of
the Popish enemy learned therefrom my masters to fear God and to
fear naught else and having acquitted himself worthily in his place and
calling as a righteous scourge of the Spaniard and a faithful soldier
of the Lord Jesus Christ is now exalted to his reward as Elijah was of
old in a chariot of fire unto heaven letting fall I trust and pray
upon you who are left behind the mantle of his valor and his godliness
that so these shores may never be without brave and pious mariners who
will count their lives as worthless in the cause of their Country their
Bible and their Queen Amen

And feeling for his companions hands he walked slowly from the
churchyard and across the village street and up the lane to Burrough
gates while the crowd made way for him in solemn silence as for an
awful being shut up alone with all his strength valor and fame in
the dark prisonhouse of his mysterious doom

He seemed to know perfectly when they had reached the gates opened the
lock with his own hands and went boldly forward along the gravel path
while Cary and Brimblecombe followed him trembling for they expected
some violent burst of emotion either from him or his mother and the
two good fellows tender hearts were fluttering like a girls Up to
the door he went as if he had seen it felt for the entrance stood
therein and called quietly Mother

In a moment his mother was on his bosom

Neither spoke for awhile She sobbing inwardly with tearless eyes he
standing firm and cheerful with his great arms clasped around her

Mother he said at last I am come home you see because I needs
must come Will you take me in and look after this useless carcase I
shall not be so very troublesome mothershall I and he looked down
and smiled upon her and kissed her brow

She answered not a word but passed her arm gently round his waist and
led him in

Take care of your head dear child the doors are low And they went
in together

Will Jack called Amyas turning round but the two good fellows had
walked briskly off

Im glad we are away said Cary I should have made a baby of myself
in another minute watching that angel of a woman How her face worked
and how she kept it in

Ah well said Jack there goes a brave servant of the queens cut
off before his work was a quarter done Heigho I must home now and see
my old father and then

And then home with me said Cary You and I never part again We have
pulled in the same boat too long Jack and you must not go spending
your prizemoney in riotous living I must see after you old Jack
ashore or we shall have you treating half the town in taverns for a
week to come

Oh Mr Cary said Jack scandalized

Come home with me and well poison the parson and my father shall
give you the rectory

Oh Mr Cary said Jack

So the two went off to Clovelly together that very day

And Amyas was sitting all alone His mother had gone out for a few
minutes to speak to the seamen who had brought up Amyass luggage and
set them down to eat and drink and Amyas sat in the old baywindow
where he had sat when he was a little tiny boy and read King Arthur
and Foxs Martyrs and The Cruelties of the Spaniards He put out
his hand and felt for them there they lay side by side just as they
had lain twenty years before The window was open and a cool air
brought in as of old the scents of the fourseason roses and rosemary
and autumn gilliflowers And there was a dish of apples on the table he
knew it by their smell the very same old apples which he used to gather
when he was a boy He put out his hand and took them and felt them
over and played with them just as if the twenty years had never been
and as he fingered them the whole of his past life rose up before him
as in that strange dream which is said to flash across the imagination
of a drowning man and he saw all the places which he had ever seen and
heard all the words which had ever been spoken to himtill he came to
that fairy island on the Meta and he heard the roar of the cataract
once more and saw the green tops of the palmtrees sleeping in the
sunlight far above the spray and stept amid the smooth palmtrunks
across the flowerfringed boulders and leaped down to the gravel beach
beside the pool and then again rose from the ferngrown rocks the
beautiful vision of AyacanoraWhere was she He had not thought of her
till now How he had wronged her Let be he had been punished and the
account was squared Perhaps she did not care for him any longer Who
would care for a great blind ox like him who must be fed and tended
like a baby for the rest of his lazy life Tut How long his mother
was away And he began playing again with his apples and thought about
nothing but them and his climbs with Frank in the orchard years ago

At last one of them slipt through his fingers and fell on the floor He
stooped and felt for it but he could not find it Vexatious He turned
hastily to search in another direction and struck his head sharply
against the table

Was it the pain or the little disappointment or was it the sense of
his blindness brought home to him in that ludicrous commonplace way
and for that very reason all the more humiliating or was it the sudden
revulsion of overstrained nerves produced by that slight shock Or had
he become indeed a child once more I know not but so it was that he
stamped on the floor with pettishness and then checking himself burst
into a violent flood of tears

A quick rustle passed him the apple was replaced in his hand and
Ayacanoras voice sobbed out

There there it is Do not weep Oh do not weep I cannot bear it
I will get you all you want Only let me fetch and carry for you tend
you feed you lead you like your slave your dog Say that I may be
your slave and falling on her knees at his feet she seized both his
hands and covered them with kisses

Yes she cried I will be your slave I must be You cannot help it
You cannot escape from me now You cannot go to sea You cannot turn
your back upon wretched me I have you safe now Safe and she clutched
his hands triumphantly Ah and what a wretch I am to rejoice in that
to taunt him with his blindness Oh forgive me I am but a poor wild
girla wild Indian savage you know butbut and she burst into
tears

A great spasm shook the body and soul of Amyas Leigh he sat quite
silent for a minute and then said solemnly

And is this still possible Then God have mercy upon me a sinner

Ayacanora looked up in his face inquiringly but before she could speak
again he had bent down and lifting her as the lion lifts the lamb
pressed her to his bosom and covered her face with kisses

The door opened There was the rustle of a gown Ayacanora sprang from
him with a little cry and stood halftrembling halfdefiant as if to
say He is mine now no one dare part him from me

Who is it asked Amyas

Your mother

You see that I am bringing forth fruits meet for repentance mother
said he with a smile

He heard her approach Then a kiss and a sob passed between the women
and he felt Ayacanora sink once more upon his bosom

Amyas my son said the silver voice of Mrs Leigh low dreamy like
the faroff chimes of angels bells from out the highest heaven fear
not to take her to your heart again for it is your mother who has laid
her there

It is true after all said Amyas to himself What God has joined
together man cannot put asunder

     

From that hour Ayacanoras power of song returned to her and day by
day year after year her voice rose up within that happy home and
soared as on a skylarks wings into the highest heaven bearing with
it the peaceful thoughts of the blind giant back to the Paradises of the
West in the wake of the heroes who from that time forth sailed out to
colonize another and a vaster England to the heavenprospered cry of
WestwardHo
