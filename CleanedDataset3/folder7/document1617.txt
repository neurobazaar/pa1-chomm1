THE WIND IN THE ROSEBUSH


Ford Village has no railroad station being on the other side of the
river from Porters Falls and accessible only by the ford which gives
it its name and a ferry line

The ferryboat was waiting when Rebecca Flint got off the train with
her bag and lunch basket When she and her small trunk were safely
embarked she sat stiff and straight and calm in the ferryboat as it
shot swiftly and smoothly across stream There was a horse attached to
a light country wagon on board and he pawed the deck uneasily His
owner stood near with a wary eye upon him although he was chewing
with as dully reflective an expression as a cow Beside Rebecca sat a
woman of about her own age who kept looking at her with furtive
curiosity her husband short and stout and saturnine stood near her
Rebecca paid no attention to either of them She was tall and spare
and pale the type of a spinster yet with rudimentary lines and
expressions of matronhood She all unconsciously held her shawl rolled
up in a canvas bag on her left hip as if it had been a child She
wore a settled frown of dissent at life but it was the frown of a
mother who regarded life as a froward child rather than as an
overwhelming fate

The other woman continued staring at her she was mildly stupid except
for an overdeveloped curiosity which made her at times sharp beyond
belief Her eyes glittered red spots came on her flaccid cheeks she
kept opening her mouth to speak making little abortive motions
Finally she could endure it no longer she nudged Rebecca boldly

A pleasant day said she

Rebecca looked at her and nodded coldly

Yes very she assented

Have you come far

I have come from Michigan

Oh said the woman with awe Its a long way she remarked
presently

Yes it is replied Rebecca conclusively

Still the other woman was not daunted there was something which she
determined to know possibly roused thereto by a vague sense of
incongruity in the others appearance Its a long ways to come and
leave a family she remarked with painful slyness

I aint got any family to leave returned Rebecca shortly

Then you aint

No I aint

Oh said the woman

Rebecca looked straight ahead at the race of the river

It was a long ferry Finally Rebecca herself waxed unexpectedly
loquacious She turned to the other woman and inquired if she knew
John Dents widow who lived in Ford Village Her husband died about
three years ago said she by way of detail

The woman started violently She turned pale then she flushed she
cast a strange glance at her husband who was regarding both women with
a sort of stolid keenness

Yes I guess I do faltered the woman finally

Well his first wife was my sister said Rebecca with the air of one
imparting important intelligence

Was she responded the other woman feebly She glanced at her
husband with an expression of doubt and terror and he shook his head
forbiddingly

Im going to see her and take my niece Agnes home with me said
Rebecca

Then the woman gave such a violent start that she noticed it

What is the matter she asked

Nothin I guess replied the woman with eyes on her husband who
was slowly shaking his head like a Chinese toy

Is my niece sick asked Rebecca with quick suspicion

No she aint sick replied the woman with alacrity then she caught
her breath with a gasp

When did you see her

Let me see I aint seen her for some little time replied the woman
Then she caught her breath again

She ought to have grown up real pretty if she takes after my sister
She was a real pretty woman Rebecca said wistfully

Yes I guess she did grow up pretty replied the woman in a trembling
voice

What kind of a woman is the second wife

The woman glanced at her husbands warning face She continued to gaze
at him while she replied in a choking voice to Rebecca

Iguess shes a nice woman she replied Idont know Iguess
so Idont see much of her

I felt kind of hurt that John married again so quick said Rebecca
but I suppose he wanted his house kept and Agnes wanted care I
wasnt so situated that I could take her when her mother died I had
my own mother to care for and I was schoolteaching Now mother has
gone and my uncle died six months ago and left me quite a little
property and Ive given up my school and Ive come for Agnes I
guess shell be glad to go with me though I suppose her stepmother is
a good woman and has always done for her

The mans warning shake at his wife was fairly portentous

I guess so said she

John always wrote that she was a beautiful woman said Rebecca

Then the ferryboat grated on the shore

John Dents widow had sent a horse and wagon to meet her sisterinlaw
When the woman and her husband went down the road on which Rebecca in
the wagon with her trunk soon passed them she said reproachfully

Seems as if Id ought to have told her Thomas

Let her find it out herself replied the man Dont you go to
burnin your fingers in other folks puddin Maria

Do you spose shell see anything asked the woman with a spasmodic
shudder and a terrified roll of her eyes

See returned her husband with stolid scorn Better be sure theres
anything to see

Oh Thomas they say

Lord aint you found out that what they say is mostly lies

But if it should be true and shes a nervous woman she might be
scared enough to lose her wits said his wife staring uneasily after
Rebeccas erect figure in the wagon disappearing over the crest of the
hilly road

Wits that so easy upset aint worth much declared the man You
keep out of it Maria

Rebecca in the meantime rode on in the wagon beside a flaxenheaded
boy who looked to her understanding not very bright She asked him
a question and he paid no attention She repeated it and he
responded with a bewildered and incoherent grunt Then she let him
alone after making sure that he knew how to drive straight

They had traveled about half a mile passed the village square and
gone a short distance beyond when the boy drew up with a sudden Whoa
before a very prosperouslooking house It had been one of the
aboriginal cottages of the vicinity small and white with a roof
extending on one side over a piazza and a tiny L jutting out in the
rear on the right hand Now the cottage was transformed by dormer
windows a bay window on the piazzaless side a carved railing down the
front steps and a modern hardwood door

Is this John Dents house asked Rebecca

The boy was as sparing of speech as a philosopher His only response
was in flinging the reins over the horses back stretching out one
foot to the shaft and leaping out of the wagon then going around to
the rear for the trunk Rebecca got out and went toward the house
Its white paint had a new gloss its blinds were an immaculate apple
green the lawn was trimmed as smooth as velvet and it was dotted with
scrupulous groups of hydrangeas and cannas

I always understood that John Dent was welltodo Rebecca reflected
comfortably I guess Agnes will have considerable Ive got enough
but it will come in handy for her schooling She can have advantages

The boy dragged the trunk up the fine gravelwalk but before he
reached the steps leading up to the piazza for the house stood on a
terrace the front door opened and a fair frizzled head of a very
large and handsome woman appeared She held up her black silk skirt
disclosing voluminous ruffles of starched embroidery and waited for
Rebecca She smiled placidly her pink doublechinned face widened
and dimpled but her blue eyes were wary and calculating She extended
her hand as Rebecca climbed the steps

This is Miss Flint I suppose said she

Yes maam replied Rebecca noticing with bewilderment a curious
expression compounded of fear and defiance on the others face

Your letter only arrived this morning said Mrs Dent in a steady
voice Her great face was a uniform pink and her chinablue eyes were
at once aggressive and veiled with secrecy

Yes I hardly thought youd get my letter replied Rebecca I felt
as if I could not wait to hear from you before I came I supposed you
would be so situated that you could have me a little while without
putting you out too much from what John used to write me about his
circumstances and when I had that money so unexpected I felt as if I
must come for Agnes I suppose you will be willing to give her up
You know shes my own blood and of course shes no relation to you
though you must have got attached to her I know from her picture what
a sweet girl she must be and John always said she looked like her own
mother and Grace was a beautiful woman if she was my sister

Rebecca stopped and stared at the other woman in amazement and alarm
The great handsome blonde creature stood speechless livid gasping
with her hand to her heart her lips parted in a horrible caricature of
a smile

Are you sick cried Rebecca drawing near Dont you want me to get
you some water

Then Mrs Dent recovered herself with a great effort It is nothing
she said I am subject tospells I am over it now Wont you come
in Miss Flint

As she spoke the beautiful deeprose colour suffused her face her
blue eyes met her visitors with the opaqueness of turquoisewith a
revelation of blue but a concealment of all behind

Rebecca followed her hostess in and the boy who had waited
quiescently climbed the steps with the trunk But before they entered
the door a strange thing happened On the upper terrace close to the
piazzapost grew a great rosebush and on it late in the season
though it was one small red perfect rose

Rebecca looked at it and the other woman extended her hand with a
quick gesture Dont you pick that rose she brusquely cried

Rebecca drew herself up with stiff dignity

I aint in the habit of picking other folks roses without leave
said she

As Rebecca spoke she started violently and lost sight of her
resentment for something singular happened Suddenly the rosebush
was agitated violently as if by a gust of wind yet it was a remarkably
still day Not a leaf of the hydrangea standing on the terrace close
to the rose trembled

What on earth began Rebecca then she stopped with a gasp at the
sight of the other womans face Although a face it gave somehow the
impression of a desperately clutched hand of secrecy

Come in said she in a harsh voice which seemed to come forth from
her chest with no intervention of the organs of speech Come into the
house Im getting cold out here

What makes that rosebush blow so when their isnt any wind asked
Rebecca trembling with vague horror yet resolute

I dont see as it is blowing returned the woman calmly And as she
spoke indeed the bush was quiet

It was blowing declared Rebecca

It isnt now said Mrs Dent I cant try to account for everything
that blows outofdoors I have too much to do

She spoke scornfully and confidently with defiant unflinching eyes
first on the bush then on Rebecca and led the way into the house

It looked queer persisted Rebecca but she followed and also the
boy with the trunk

Rebecca entered an interior prosperous even elegant according to her
simple ideas There were Brussels carpets lace curtains and plenty of
brilliant upholstery and polished wood

Youre real nicely situated remarked Rebecca after she had become a
little accustomed to her new surroundings and the two women were seated
at the teatable

Mrs Dent stared with a hard complacency from behind her silverplated
service Yes I be said she

You got all the things new said Rebecca hesitatingly with a jealous
memory of her dead sisters bridal furnishings

Yes said Mrs Dent I was never one to want dead folks things and
I had money enough of my own so I wasnt beholden to John I had the
old duds put up at auction They didnt bring much

I suppose you saved some for Agnes Shell want some of her poor
mothers things when she is grown up said Rebecca with some
indignation

The defiant stare of Mrs Dents blue eyes waxed more intense Theres
a few things up garret said she

Shell be likely to value them remarked Rebecca As she spoke she
glanced at the window Isnt it most time for her to be coming home
she asked

Most time answered Mrs Dent carelessly but when she gets over to
Addie Slocums she never knows when to come home

Is Addie Slocum her intimate friend

Intimate as any

Maybe we can have her come out to see Agnes when shes living with
me said Rebecca wistfully I suppose shell be likely to be
homesick at first

Most likely answered Mrs Dent

Does she call you mother Rebecca asked

No she calls me Aunt Emeline replied the other woman shortly When
did you say you were going home

In about a week I thought if she can be ready to go so soon
answered Rebecca with a surprised look

She reflected that she would not remain a day longer than she could
help after such an inhospitable look and question

Oh as far as that goes said Mrs Dent it wouldnt make any
difference about her being ready You could go home whenever you felt
that you must and she could come afterward

Alone

Why not Shes a big girl now and you dont have to change cars

My niece will go home when I do and not travel alone and if I cant
wait here for her in the house that used to be her mothers and my
sisters home Ill go and board somewhere returned Rebecca with
warmth

Oh you can stay here as long as you want to Youre welcome said
Mrs Dent

Then Rebecca started There she is she declared in a trembling
exultant voice Nobody knew how she longed to see the girl

She isnt as late as I thought shed be said Mrs Dent and again
that curious subtle change passed over her face and again it settled
into that stony impassiveness

Rebecca stared at the door waiting for it to open Where is she
she asked presently

I guess shes stopped to take off her hat in the entry suggested
Mrs Dent

Rebecca waited Why dont she come It cant take her all this time
to take off her hat

For answer Mrs Dent rose with a stiff jerk and threw open the door

Agnes she called Agnes Then she turned and eyed Rebecca She
aint there

I saw her pass the window said Rebecca in bewilderment

You must have been mistaken

I know I did persisted Rebecca

You couldnt have

I did I saw first a shadow go over the ceiling then I saw her in
the glass thereshe pointed to a mirror over the sideboard
oppositeand then the shadow passed the window

How did she look in the glass

Little and lighthaired with the light hair kind of tossing over her
forehead

You couldnt have seen her

Was that like Agnes

Like enough but of course you didnt see her Youve been thinking
so much about her that you thought you did

You thought YOU did

I thought I saw a shadow pass the window but I must have been
mistaken She didnt come in or we would have seen her before now I
knew it was too early for her to get home from Addie Slocums anyhow

When Rebecca went to bed Agnes had not returned Rebecca had resolved
that she would not retire until the girl came but she was very tired
and she reasoned with herself that she was foolish Besides Mrs Dent
suggested that Agnes might go to the church social with Addie Slocum
When Rebecca suggested that she be sent for and told that her aunt had
come Mrs Dent laughed meaningly

I guess youll find out that a young girl aint so ready to leave a
sociable where theres boys to see her aunt said she

Shes too young said Rebecca incredulously and indignantly

Shes sixteen replied Mrs Dent and shes always been great for
the boys

Shes going to school four years after I get her before she thinks of
boys declared Rebecca

Well see laughed the other woman

After Rebecca went to bed she lay awake a long time listening for the
sound of girlish laughter and a boys voice under her window then she
fell asleep

The next morning she was down early Mrs Dent who kept no servants
was busily preparing breakfast

Dont Agnes help you about breakfast asked Rebecca

No I let her lay replied Mrs Dent shortly

What time did she get home last night

She didnt get home

What

She didnt get home She stayed with Addie She often does

Without sending you word

Oh she knew I wouldnt worry

When will she be home

Oh I guess shell be along pretty soon

Rebecca was uneasy but she tried to conceal it for she knew of no
good reason for uneasiness What was there to occasion alarm in the
fact of one young girl staying overnight with another She could not
eat much breakfast Afterward she went out on the little piazza
although her hostess strove furtively to stop her

Why dont you go out back of the house Its real prettya view over
the river she said

I guess Ill go out here replied Rebecca She had a purpose to
watch for the absent girl

Presently Rebecca came hustling into the house through the
sittingroom into the kitchen where Mrs Dent was cooking

That rosebush she gasped

Mrs Dent turned and faced her

What of it

Its ablowing

What of it

There isnt a mite of wind this morning

Mrs Dent turned with an inimitable toss of her fair head If you
think I can spend my time puzzling over such nonsense as she began
but Rebecca interrupted her with a cry and a rush to the door

There she is now she cried She flung the door wide open and
curiously enough a breeze came in and her own gray hair tossed and a
paper blew off the table to the floor with a loud rustle but there was
nobody in sight

Theres nobody here Rebecca said

She looked blankly at the other woman who brought her rollingpin down
on a slab of piecrust with a thud

I didnt hear anybody she said calmly

I SAW SOMEBODY PASS THAT WINDOW

You were mistaken again

I KNOW I saw somebody

You couldnt have Please shut that door

Rebecca shut the door She sat down beside the window and looked out
on the autumnal yard with its little curve of footpath to the kitchen
door

What smells so strong of roses in this room she said presently She
sniffed hard

I dont smell anything but these nutmegs

It is not nutmeg

I dont smell anything else

Where do you suppose Agnes is

Oh perhaps she has gone over the ferry to Porters Falls with Addie
She often does Addies got an aunt over there and Addies got a
cousin a real pretty boy

You suppose shes gone over there

Mebbe I shouldnt wonder

When should she be home

Oh not before afternoon

Rebecca waited with all the patience she could muster She kept
reassuring herself telling herself that it was all natural that the
other woman could not help it but she made up her mind that if Agnes
did not return that afternoon she should be sent for

When it was four oclock she started up with resolution She had been
furtively watching the onyx clock on the sittingroom mantel she had
timed herself She had said that if Agnes was not home by that time
she should demand that she be sent for She rose and stood before Mrs
Dent who looked up coolly from her embroidery

Ive waited just as long as Im going to she said Ive come way
from Michigan to see my own sisters daughter and take her home with
me Ive been here ever since yesterdaytwentyfour hoursand I
havent seen her Now Im going to I want her sent for

Mrs Dent folded her embroidery and rose

Well I dont blame you she said It is high time she came home
Ill go right over and get her myself

Rebecca heaved a sigh of relief She hardly knew what she had
suspected or feared but she knew that her position had been one of
antagonism if not accusation and she was sensible of relief

I wish you would she said gratefully and went back to her chair
while Mrs Dent got her shawl and her little white headtie I
wouldnt trouble you but I do feel as if I couldnt wait any longer to
see her she remarked apologetically

Oh it aint any trouble at all said Mrs Dent as she went out I
dont blame you you have waited long enough

Rebecca sat at the window watching breathlessly until Mrs Dent came
stepping through the yard alone She ran to the door and saw hardly
noticing it this time that the rosebush was again violently agitated
yet with no wind evident elsewhere

Where is she she cried

Mrs Dent laughed with stiff lips as she came up the steps over the
terrace Girls will be girls said she Shes gone with Addie to
Lincoln Addies got an uncle whos conductor on the train and lives
there and he got em passes and theyre goin to stay to Addies Aunt
Margarets a few days Mrs Slocum said Agnes didnt have time to come
over and ask me before the train went but she took it on herself to
say it would be all right and

Why hadnt she been over to tell you Rebecca was angry though not
suspicious She even saw no reason for her anger

Oh she was putting up grapes She was coming over just as soon as
she got the black off her hands She heard I had company and her
hands were a sight She was holding them over sulphur matches

You say shes going to stay a few days repeated Rebecca dazedly

Yes till Thursday Mrs Slocum said

How far is Lincoln from here

About fifty miles Itll be a real treat to her Mrs Slocums
sister is a real nice woman

It is goin to make it pretty late about my goin home

If you dont feel as if you could wait Ill get her ready and send
her on just as soon as I can Mrs Dent said sweetly

Im going to wait said Rebecca grimly

The two women sat down again and Mrs Dent took up her embroidery

Is there any sewing I can do for her Rebecca asked finally in a
desperate way If I can get her sewing along some

Mrs Dent arose with alacrity and fetched a mass of white from the
closet Here she said if you want to sew the lace on this
nightgown I was going to put her to it but shell be glad enough to
get rid of it She ought to have this and one more before she goes I
dont like to send her away without some good underclothing

Rebecca snatched at the little white garment and sewed feverishly

That night she wakened from a deep sleep a little after midnight and
lay a minute trying to collect her faculties and explain to herself
what she was listening to At last she discovered that it was the then
popular strains of The Maidens Prayer floating up through the floor
from the piano in the sittingroom below She jumped up threw a shawl
over her nightgown and hurried downstairs trembling There was nobody
in the sittingroom the piano was silent She ran to Mrs Dents
bedroom and called hysterically

Emeline Emeline

What is it asked Mrs Dents voice from the bed The voice was
stern but had a note of consciousness in it

Whowho was that playing The Maidens Prayer in the sittingroom
on the piano

I didnt hear anybody

There was some one

I didnt hear anything

I tell you there was some one ButTHERE AINT ANYBODY THERE

I didnt hear anything

I didsomebody playing The Maidens Prayer on the piano Has Agnes
got home I WANT TO KNOW

Of course Agnes hasnt got home answered Mrs Dent with rising
inflection Be you gone crazy over that girl The last boat from
Porters Falls was in before we went to bed Of course she aint come

I heard

You were dreaming

I wasnt I was broad awake

Rebecca went back to her chamber and kept her lamp burning all night

The next morning her eyes upon Mrs Dent were wary and blazing with
suppressed excitement She kept opening her mouth as if to speak then
frowning and setting her lips hard After breakfast she went
upstairs and came down presently with her coat and bonnet

Now Emeline she said I want to know where the Slocums live

Mrs Dent gave a strange long halflidded glance at her She was
finishing her coffee

Why she asked

Im going over there and find out if they have heard anything from her
daughter and Agnes since they went away I dont like what I heard
last night

You must have been dreaming

It dont make any odds whether I was or not Does she play The
Maidens Prayer on the piano I want to know

What if she does She plays it a little I believe I dont know
She dont half play it anyhow she aint got an ear

That wasnt half played last night I dont like such things
happening I aint superstitious but I dont like it Im going
Where do the Slocums live

You go down the road over the bridge past the old grist mill then you
turn to the left its the only house for half a mile You cant miss
it It has a barn with a ship in full sail on the cupola

Well Im going I dont feel easy

About two hours later Rebecca returned There were red spots on her
cheeks She looked wild Ive been there she said and there
isnt a soul at home Something HAS happened

What has happened

I dont know Something I had a warning last night There wasnt a
soul there Theyve been sent for to Lincoln

Did you see anybody to ask asked Mrs Dent with thinly concealed
anxiety

I asked the woman that lives on the turn of the road Shes stone
deaf I suppose you know She listened while I screamed at her to
know where the Slocums were and then she said Mrs Smith dont live
here I didnt see anybody on the road and thats the only house
What do you suppose it means

I dont suppose it means much of anything replied Mrs Dent coolly
Mr Slocum is conductor on the railroad and hed be away anyway and
Mrs Slocum often goes early when he does to spend the day with her
sister in Porters Falls Shed be more likely to go away than Addie

And you dont think anything has happened Rebecca asked with
diminishing distrust before the reasonableness of it

Land no

Rebecca went upstairs to lay aside her coat and bonnet But she came
hurrying back with them still on

Whos been in my room she gasped Her face was pale as ashes

Mrs Dent also paled as she regarded her

What do you mean she asked slowly

I found when I went upstairs thatlittle nightgown ofAgness
onthe bed laid out It wasLAID OUT The sleeves were folded
across the bosom and there was that little red rose between them
Emeline what is it Emeline whats the matter Oh

Mrs Dent was struggling for breath in great choking gasps She clung
to the back of a chair Rebecca trembling herself so she could
scarcely keep on her feet got her some water

As soon as she recovered herself Mrs Dent regarded her with eyes full
of the strangest mixture of fear and horror and hostility

What do you mean talking so she said in a hard voice

It IS THERE

Nonsense You threw it down and it fell that way

It was folded in my bureau drawer

It couldnt have been

Who picked that red rose

Look on the bush Mrs Dent replied shortly

Rebecca looked at her her mouth gaped She hurried out of the room
When she came back her eyes seemed to protrude She had in the
meantime hastened upstairs and come down with tottering steps
clinging to the banisters

Now I want to know what all this means she demanded

What what means

The rose is on the bush and its gone from the bed in my room Is
this house haunted or what

I dont know anything about a house being haunted I dont believe in
such things Be you crazy Mrs Dent spoke with gathering force
The colour flashed back to her cheeks

No said Rebecca shortly I aint crazy yet but I shall be if this
keeps on much longer Im going to find out where that girl is before
night

Mrs Dent eyed her

What be you going to do

Im going to Lincoln

A faint triumphant smile overspread Mrs Dents large face

You cant said she there aint any train

No train

No there aint any afternoon train from the Falls to Lincoln

Then Im going over to the Slocums again tonight

However Rebecca did not go such a rain came up as deterred even her
resolution and she had only her best dresses with her Then in the
evening came the letter from the Michigan village which she had left
nearly a week ago It was from her cousin a single woman who had
come to keep her house while she was away It was a pleasant
unexciting letter enough all the first of it and related mostly how
she missed Rebecca how she hoped she was having pleasant weather and
kept her health and how her friend Mrs Greenaway had come to stay
with her since she had felt lonesome the first night in the house how
she hoped Rebecca would have no objections to this although nothing
had been said about it since she had not realized that she might be
nervous alone The cousin was painfully conscientious hence the
letter Rebecca smiled in spite of her disturbed mind as she read it
then her eye caught the postscript That was in a different hand
purporting to be written by the friend Mrs Hannah Greenaway
informing her that the cousin had fallen down the cellar stairs and
broken her hip and was in a dangerous condition and begging Rebecca
to return at once as she herself was rheumatic and unable to nurse her
properly and no one else could be obtained

Rebecca looked at Mrs Dent who had come to her room with the letter
quite late it was halfpast nine and she had gone upstairs for the
night

Where did this come from she asked

Mr Amblecrom brought it she replied

Whos he

The postmaster He often brings the letters that come on the late
mail He knows I aint anybody to send He brought yours about your
coming He said he and his wife came over on the ferryboat with you

I remember him Rebecca replied shortly Theres bad news in this
letter

Mrs Dents face took on an expression of serious inquiry

Yes my Cousin Harriet has fallen down the cellar stairsthey were
always dangerousand shes broken her hip and Ive got to take the
first train home tomorrow

You dont say so Im dreadfully sorry

No you aint sorry said Rebecca with a look as if she leaped
Youre glad I dont know why but youre glad Youve wanted to get
rid of me for some reason ever since I came I dont know why Youre
a strange woman Now youve got your way and I hope youre satisfied

How you talk

Mrs Dent spoke in a faintly injured voice but there was a light in
her eyes

I talk the way it is Well Im going tomorrow morning and I want
you just as soon as Agnes Dent comes home to send her out to me
Dont you wait for anything You pack what clothes shes got and
dont wait even to mend them and you buy her ticket Ill leave the
money and you send her along She dont have to change cars You
start her off when she gets home on the next train

Very well replied the other woman She had an expression of covert
amusement

Mind you do it

Very well Rebecca

Rebecca started on her journey the next morning When she arrived two
days later she found her cousin in perfect health She found
moreover that the friend had not written the postscript in the
cousins letter Rebecca would have returned to Ford Village the next
morning but the fatigue and nervous strain had been too much for her
She was not able to move from her bed She had a species of low fever
induced by anxiety and fatigue But she could write and she did to
the Slocums and she received no answer She also wrote to Mrs Dent
she even sent numerous telegrams with no response Finally she wrote
to the postmaster and an answer arrived by the first possible mail
The letter was short curt and to the purpose Mr Amblecrom the
postmaster was a man of few words and especially wary as to his
expressions in a letter

Dear madam he wrote your favour reced No Slocums in Fords
Village All dead Addie ten years ago her mother two years later
her father five House vacant Mrs John Dent said to have neglected
stepdaughter Girl was sick Medicine not given Talk of taking
action Not enough evidence House said to be haunted Strange sights
and sounds Your niece Agnes Dent died a year ago about this time

Yours truly

THOMAS AMBLECROM




THE SHADOWS ON THE WALL


Henry had words with Edward in the study the night before Edward
died said Caroline Glynn

She was elderly tall and harshly thin with a hard colourlessness of
face She spoke not with acrimony but with grave severity Rebecca
Ann Glynn younger stouter and rosy of face between her crinkling
puffs of gray hair gasped by way of assent She sat in a wide
flounce of black silk in the corner of the sofa and rolled terrified
eyes from her sister Caroline to her sister Mrs Stephen Brigham who
had been Emma Glynn the one beauty of the family She was beautiful
still with a large splendid fullblown beauty she filled a great
rockingchair with her superb bulk of femininity and swayed gently
back and forth her black silks whispering and her black frills
fluttering Even the shock of death for her brother Edward lay dead
in the house could not disturb her outward serenity of demeanour
She was grieved over the loss of her brother he had been the youngest
and she had been fond of him but never had Emma Brigham lost sight of
her own importance amidst the waters of tribulation She was always
awake to the consciousness of her own stability in the midst of
vicissitudes and the splendour of her permanent bearing

But even her expression of masterly placidity changed before her sister
Carolines announcement and her sister Rebecca Anns gasp of terror and
distress in response

I think Henry might have controlled his temper when poor Edward was
so near his end said she with an asperity which disturbed slightly
the roseate curves of her beautiful mouth

Of course he did not KNOW murmured Rebecca Ann in a faint tone
strangely out of keeping with her appearance

One involuntarily looked again to be sure that such a feeble pipe came
from that fullswelling chest

Of course he did not know it said Caroline quickly She turned on
her sister with a strange sharp look of suspicion How could he have
known it said she Then she shrank as if from the others possible
answer Of course you and I both know he could not said she
conclusively but her pale face was paler than it had been before

Rebecca gasped again The married sister Mrs Emma Brigham was now
sitting up straight in her chair she had ceased rocking and was
eyeing them both intently with a sudden accentuation of family likeness
in her face Given one common intensity of emotion and similar lines
showed forth and the three sisters of one race were evident

What do you mean said she impartially to them both Then she too
seemed to shrink before a possible answer She even laughed an evasive
sort of laugh I guess you dont mean anything said she but her
face wore still the expression of shrinking horror

Nobody means anything said Caroline firmly She rose and crossed
the room toward the door with grim decisiveness

Where are you going asked Mrs Brigham

I have something to see to replied Caroline and the others at once
knew by her tone that she had some solemn and sad duty to perform in
the chamber of death

Oh said Mrs Brigham

After the door had closed behind Caroline she turned to Rebecca

Did Henry have many words with him she asked

They were talking very loud replied Rebecca evasively yet with an
answering gleam of ready response to the others curiosity in the quick
lift of her soft blue eyes

Mrs Brigham looked at her She had not resumed rocking She still
sat up straight with a slight knitting of intensity on her fair
forehead between the pretty rippling curves of her auburn hair

Did youhear anything she asked in a low voice with a glance toward
the door

I was just across the hall in the south parlour and that door was
open and this door ajar replied Rebecca with a slight flush

Then you must have

I couldnt help it

Everything

Most of it

What was it

The old story

I suppose Henry was mad as he always was because Edward was living
on here for nothing when he had wasted all the money father left him

Rebecca nodded with a fearful glance at the door

When Emma spoke again her voice was still more hushed I know how he
felt said she He had always been so prudent himself and worked
hard at his profession and there Edward had never done anything but
spend and it must have looked to him as if Edward was living at his
expense but he wasnt

No he wasnt

It was the way father left the propertythat all the children should
have a home hereand he left money enough to buy the food and all if
we had all come home

Yes

And Edward had a right here according to the terms of fathers will
and Henry ought to have remembered it

Yes he ought

Did he say hard things

Pretty hard from what I heard

What

I heard him tell Edward that he had no business here at all and he
thought he had better go away

What did Edward say

That he would stay here as long as he lived and afterward too if he
was a mind to and he would like to see Henry get him out and then

What

Then he laughed

What did Henry say

I didnt hear him say anything but

But what

I saw him when he came out of this room

He looked mad

Youve seen him when he looked so

Emma nodded the expression of horror on her face had deepened

Do you remember that time he killed the cat because she had scratched
him

Yes Dont

Then Caroline reentered the room She went up to the stove in which a
wood fire was burningit was a cold gloomy day of falland she
warmed her hands which were reddened from recent washing in cold water

Mrs Brigham looked at her and hesitated She glanced at the door
which was still ajar as it did not easily shut being still swollen
with the damp weather of the summer She rose and pushed it together
with a sharp thud which jarred the house Rebecca started painfully
with a half exclamation Caroline looked at her disapprovingly

It is time you controlled your nerves Rebecca said she

I cant help it replied Rebecca with almost a wail I am nervous
Theres enough to make me so the Lord knows

What do you mean by that asked Caroline with her old air of sharp
suspicion and something between challenge and dread of its being met

Rebecca shrank

Nothing said she

Then I wouldnt keep speaking in such a fashion

Emma returning from the closed door said imperiously that it ought to
be fixed it shut so hard

It will shrink enough after we have had the fire a few days replied
Caroline If anything is done to it it will be too small there will
be a crack at the sill

I think Henry ought to be ashamed of himself for talking as he did to
Edward said Mrs Brigham abruptly but in an almost inaudible voice

Hush said Caroline with a glance of actual fear at the closed door

Nobody can hear with the door shut

He must have heard it shut and

Well I can say what I want to before he comes down and I am not
afraid of him

I dont know who is afraid of him What reason is there for anybody
to be afraid of Henry demanded Caroline

Mrs Brigham trembled before her sisters look Rebecca gasped again
There isnt any reason of course Why should there be

I wouldnt speak so then Somebody might overhear you and think it
was queer Miranda Joy is in the south parlour sewing you know

I thought she went upstairs to stitch on the machine

She did but she has come down again

Well she cant hear

I say again I think Henry ought to be ashamed of himself I shouldnt
think hed ever get over it having words with poor Edward the very
night before he died Edward was enough sight better disposition than
Henry with all his faults I always thought a great deal of poor
Edward myself

Mrs Brigham passed a large fluff of handkerchief across her eyes
Rebecca sobbed outright

Rebecca said Caroline admonishingly keeping her mouth stiff and
swallowing determinately

I never heard him speak a cross word unless he spoke cross to Henry
that last night I dont know but he did from what Rebecca
overheard said Emma

Not so much cross as sort of soft and sweet and aggravating
sniffled Rebecca

He never raised his voice said Caroline but he had his way

He had a right to in this case

Yes he did

He had as much of a right here as Henry sobbed Rebecca and now
hes gone and he will never be in this home that poor father left him
and the rest of us again

What do you really think ailed Edward asked Emma in hardly more than
a whisper She did not look at her sister

Caroline sat down in a nearby armchair and clutched the arms
convulsively until her thin knuckles whitened

I told you said she

Rebecca held her handkerchief over her mouth and looked at them above
it with terrified streaming eyes

I know you said that he had terrible pains in his stomach and had
spasms but what do you think made him have them

Henry called it gastric trouble You know Edward has always had
dyspepsia

Mrs Brigham hesitated a moment Was there any talk of
anexamination said she

Then Caroline turned on her fiercely

No said she in a terrible voice No

The three sisters souls seemed to meet on one common ground of
terrified understanding though their eyes The oldfashioned latch of
the door was heard to rattle and a push from without made the door
shake ineffectually Its Henry Rebecca sighed rather than
whispered Mrs Brigham settled herself after a noiseless rush across
the floor into her rockingchair again and was swaying back and forth
with her head comfortably leaning back when the door at last yielded
and Henry Glynn entered He cast a covertly sharp comprehensive
glance at Mrs Brigham with her elaborate calm at Rebecca quietly
huddled in the corner of the sofa with her handkerchief to her face and
only one small reddened ear as attentive as a dogs uncovered and
revealing her alertness for his presence at Caroline sitting with a
strained composure in her armchair by the stove She met his eyes
quite firmly with a look of inscrutable fear and defiance of the fear
and of him

Henry Glynn looked more like this sister than the others Both had the
same hard delicacy of form and feature both were tall and almost
emaciated both had a sparse growth of gray blond hair far back from
high intellectual foreheads both had an almost noble aquilinity of
feature They confronted each other with the pitiless immovability of
two statues in whose marble lineaments emotions were fixed for all
eternity

Then Henry Glynn smiled and the smile transformed his face He looked
suddenly years younger and an almost boyish recklessness and
irresolution appeared in his face He flung himself into a chair with
a gesture which was bewildering from its incongruity with his general
appearance He leaned his head back flung one leg over the other and
looked laughingly at Mrs Brigham

I declare Emma you grow younger every year he said

She flushed a little and her placid mouth widened at the corners She
was susceptible to praise

Our thoughts today ought to belong to the one of us who will NEVER
grow older said Caroline in a hard voice

Henry looked at her still smiling Of course we none of us forget
that said he in a deep gentle voice but we have to speak to the
living Caroline and I have not seen Emma for a long time and the
living are as dear as the dead

Not to me said Caroline

She rose and went abruptly out of the room again Rebecca also rose
and hurried after her sobbing loudly

Henry looked slowly after them

Caroline is completely unstrung said he Mrs Brigham rocked A
confidence in him inspired by his manner was stealing over her Out of
that confidence she spoke quite easily and naturally

His death was very sudden said she

Henrys eyelids quivered slightly but his gaze was unswerving

Yes said he it was very sudden He was sick only a few hours

What did you call it

Gastric

You did not think of an examination

There was no need I am perfectly certain as to the cause of his
death

Suddenly Mrs Brigham felt a creep as of some live horror over her very
soul Her flesh prickled with cold before an inflection of his voice
She rose tottering on weak knees

Where are you going asked Henry in a strange breathless voice

Mrs Brigham said something incoherent about some sewing which she had
to do some black for the funeral and was out of the room She went up
to the front chamber which she occupied Caroline was there She went
close to her and took her hands and the two sisters looked at each
other

Dont speak dont I wont have it said Caroline finally in an
awful whisper

I wont replied Emma

That afternoon the three sisters were in the study the large front
room on the ground floor across the hall from the south parlour when
the dusk deepened

Mrs Brigham was hemming some black material She sat close to the
west window for the waning light At last she laid her work on her lap

Its no use I cannot see to sew another stitch until we have a
light said she

Caroline who was writing some letters at the table turned to Rebecca
in her usual place on the sofa

Rebecca you had better get a lamp she said

Rebecca started up even in the dusk her face showed her agitation

It doesnt seem to me that we need a lamp quite yet she said in a
piteous pleading voice like a childs

Yes we do returned Mrs Brigham peremptorily We must have a
light I must finish this tonight or I cant go to the funeral and I
cant see to sew another stitch

Caroline can see to write letters and she is farther from the window
than you are said Rebecca

Are you trying to save kerosene or are you lazy Rebecca Glynn cried
Mrs Brigham I can go and get the light myself but I have this work
all in my lap

Carolines pen stopped scratching

Rebecca we must have the light said she

Had we better have it in here asked Rebecca weakly

Of course Why not cried Caroline sternly

I am sure I dont want to take my sewing into the other room when it
is all cleaned up for tomorrow said Mrs Brigham

Why I never heard such a todo about lighting a lamp

Rebecca rose and left the room Presently she entered with a lampa
large one with a white porcelain shade She set it on a table an
oldfashioned cardtable which was placed against the opposite wall
from the window That wall was clear of bookcases and books which
were only on three sides of the room That opposite wall was taken up
with three doors the one small space being occupied by the table
Above the table on the oldfashioned paper of a white satin gloss
traversed by an indeterminate green scroll hung quite high a small
gilt and blackframed ivory miniature taken in her girlhood of the
mother of the family When the lamp was set on the table beneath it
the tiny pretty face painted on the ivory seemed to gleam out with a
look of intelligence

What have you put that lamp over there for asked Mrs Brigham with
more of impatience than her voice usually revealed Why didnt you
set it in the hall and have done with it Neither Caroline nor I can
see if it is on that table

I thought perhaps you would move replied Rebecca hoarsely

If I do move we cant both sit at that table Caroline has her paper
all spread around Why dont you set the lamp on the study table in
the middle of the room then we can both see

Rebecca hesitated Her face was very pale She looked with an appeal
that was fairly agonizing at her sister Caroline

Why dont you put the lamp on this table as she says asked
Caroline almost fiercely Why do you act so Rebecca

I should think you WOULD ask her that said Mrs Brigham She
doesnt act like herself at all

Rebecca took the lamp and set it on the table in the middle of the room
without another word Then she turned her back upon it quickly and
seated herself on the sofa and placed a hand over her eyes as if to
shade them and remained so

Does the light hurt your eyes and is that the reason why you didnt
want the lamp asked Mrs Brigham kindly

I always like to sit in the dark replied Rebecca chokingly Then she
snatched her handkerchief hastily from her pocket and began to weep
Caroline continued to write Mrs Brigham to sew

Suddenly Mrs Brigham as she sewed glanced at the opposite wall The
glance became a steady stare She looked intently her work suspended
in her hands Then she looked away again and took a few more stitches
then she looked again and again turned to her task At last she laid
her work in her lap and stared concentratedly She looked from the wall
around the room taking note of the various objects she looked at the
wall long and intently Then she turned to her sisters

What IS that said she

What asked Caroline harshly her pen scratched loudly across the
paper

Rebecca gave one of her convulsive gasps

That strange shadow on the wall replied Mrs Brigham

Rebecca sat with her face hidden Caroline dipped her pen in the
inkstand

Why dont you turn around and look asked Mrs Brigham in a wondering
and somewhat aggrieved way

I am in a hurry to finish this letter if Mrs Wilson Ebbit is going
to get word in time to come to the funeral replied Caroline shortly

Mrs Brigham rose her work slipping to the floor and she began
walking around the room moving various articles of furniture with her
eyes on the shadow

Then suddenly she shrieked out

Look at this awful shadow What is it Caroline look look
Rebecca look WHAT IS IT

All Mrs Brighams triumphant placidity was gone Her handsome face
was livid with horror She stood stiffly pointing at the shadow

Look said she pointing her finger at it Look What is it

Then Rebecca burst out in a wild wail after a shuddering glance at the
wall

Oh Caroline there it is again There it is again

Caroline Glynn you look said Mrs Brigham Look What is that
dreadful shadow

Caroline rose turned and stood confronting the wall

How should I know she said

It has been there every night since he died cried Rebecca

Every night

Yes He died Thursday and this is Saturday that makes three nights
said Caroline rigidly She stood as if holding herself calm with a
vise of concentrated will

Itit looks likelike stammered Mrs Brigham in a tone of intense
horror

I know what it looks like well enough said Caroline Ive got eyes
in my head

It looks like Edward burst out Rebecca in a sort of frenzy of fear
Only

Yes it does assented Mrs Brigham whose horrorstricken tone
matched her sisters only Oh it is awful What is it Caroline

I ask you again how should I know replied Caroline I see it
there like you How should I know any more than you

It MUST be something in the room said Mrs Brigham staring wildly
around

We moved everything in the room the first night it came said
Rebecca it is not anything in the room

Caroline turned upon her with a sort of fury Of course it is
something in the room said she How you act What do you mean by
talking so Of course it is something in the room

Of course it is agreed Mrs Brigham looking at Caroline
suspiciously Of course it must be It is only a coincidence It
just happens so Perhaps it is that fold of the window curtain that
makes it It must be something in the room

It is not anything in the room repeated Rebecca with obstinate
horror

The door opened suddenly and Henry Glynn entered He began to speak
then his eyes followed the direction of the others He stood stock
still staring at the shadow on the wall It was life size and
stretched across the white parallelogram of a door half across the
wall space on which the picture hung

What is that he demanded in a strange voice

It must be due to something in the room Mrs Brigham said faintly

It is not due to anything in the room said Rebecca again with the
shrill insistency of terror

How you act Rebecca Glynn said Caroline

Henry Glynn stood and stared a moment longer His face showed a gamut
of emotionshorror conviction then furious incredulity Suddenly he
began hastening hither and thither about the room He moved the
furniture with fierce jerks turning ever to see the effect upon the
shadow on the wall Not a line of its terrible outlines wavered

It must be something in the room he declared in a voice which seemed
to snap like a lash

His face changed The inmost secrecy of his nature seemed evident
until one almost lost sight of his lineaments Rebecca stood close to
her sofa regarding him with woeful fascinated eyes Mrs Brigham
clutched Carolines hand They both stood in a corner out of his way
For a few moments he raged about the room like a caged wild animal He
moved every piece of furniture when the moving of a piece did not
affect the shadow he flung it to the floor the sisters watching

Then suddenly he desisted He laughed and began straightening the
furniture which he had flung down

What an absurdity he said easily Such a todo about a shadow

Thats so assented Mrs Brigham in a scared voice which she tried
to make natural As she spoke she lifted a chair near her

I think you have broken the chair that Edward was so fond of said
Caroline

Terror and wrath were struggling for expression on her face Her mouth
was set her eyes shrinking Henry lifted the chair with a show of
anxiety

Just as good as ever he said pleasantly He laughed again looking
at his sisters Did I scare you he said I should think you might
be used to me by this time You know my way of wanting to leap to the
bottom of a mystery and that shadow does lookqueer likeand I
thought if there was any way of accounting for it I would like to
without any delay

You dont seem to have succeeded remarked Caroline dryly with a
slight glance at the wall

Henrys eyes followed hers and he quivered perceptibly

Oh there is no accounting for shadows he said and he laughed
again A man is a fool to try to account for shadows

Then the supper bell rang and they all left the room but Henry kept
his back to the wall as did indeed the others

Mrs Brigham pressed close to Caroline as she crossed the hall He
looked like a demon she breathed in her ear

Henry led the way with an alert motion like a boy Rebecca brought up
the rear she could scarcely walk her knees trembled so

I cant sit in that room again this evening she whispered to
Caroline after supper

Very well we will sit in the south room replied Caroline I think
we will sit in the south parlour she said aloud it isnt as damp as
the study and I have a cold

So they all sat in the south room with their sewing Henry read the
newspaper his chair drawn close to the lamp on the table About nine
oclock he rose abruptly and crossed the hall to the study The three
sisters looked at one another Mrs Brigham rose folded her rustling
skirts compactly around her and began tiptoeing toward the door

What are you going to do inquired Rebecca agitatedly

I am going to see what he is about replied Mrs Brigham cautiously

She pointed as she spoke to the study door across the hall it was
ajar Henry had striven to pull it together behind him but it had
somehow swollen beyond the limit with curious speed It was still ajar
and a streak of light showed from top to bottom The hall lamp was not
lit

You had better stay where you are said Caroline with guarded
sharpness

I am going to see repeated Mrs Brigham firmly

Then she folded her skirts so tightly that her bulk with its swelling
curves was revealed in a black silk sheath and she went with a slow
toddle across the hall to the study door She stood there her eye at
the crack

In the south room Rebecca stopped sewing and sat watching with dilated
eyes Caroline sewed steadily What Mrs Brigham standing at the
crack in the study door saw was this

Henry Glynn evidently reasoning that the source of the strange shadow
must be between the table on which the lamp stood and the wall was
making systematic passes and thrusts all over and through the
intervening space with an old sword which had belonged to his father
Not an inch was left unpierced He seemed to have divided the space
into mathematical sections He brandished the sword with a sort of
cold fury and calculation the blade gave out flashes of light the
shadow remained unmoved Mrs Brigham watching felt herself cold
with horror

Finally Henry ceased and stood with the sword in hand and raised as if
to strike surveying the shadow on the wall threateningly Mrs
Brigham toddled back across the hall and shut the south room door
behind her before she related what she had seen

He looked like a demon she said again Have you got any of that
old wine in the house Caroline I dont feel as if I could stand much
more

Indeed she looked overcome Her handsome placid face was worn and
strained and pale

Yes theres plenty said Caroline you can have some when you go to
bed

I think we had all better take some said Mrs Brigham Oh my God
Caroline what

Dont ask and dont speak said Caroline

No I am not going to replied Mrs Brigham but

Rebecca moaned aloud

What are you doing that for asked Caroline harshly

Poor Edward returned Rebecca

That is all you have to groan for said Caroline There is nothing
else

I am going to bed said Mrs Brigham I shant be able to be at
the funeral if I dont

Soon the three sisters went to their chambers and the south parlour was
deserted Caroline called to Henry in the study to put out the light
before he came upstairs They had been gone about an hour when he came
into the room bringing the lamp which had stood in the study He set
it on the table and waited a few minutes pacing up and down His face
was terrible his fair complexion showed livid his blue eyes seemed
dark blanks of awful reflections

Then he took the lamp up and returned to the library He set the lamp
on the centre table and the shadow sprang out on the wall Again he
studied the furniture and moved it about but deliberately with none
of his former frenzy Nothing affected the shadow Then he returned
to the south room with the lamp and again waited Again he returned to
the study and placed the lamp on the table and the shadow sprang out
upon the wall It was midnight before he went upstairs Mrs Brigham
and the other sisters who could not sleep heard him

The next day was the funeral That evening the family sat in the south
room Some relatives were with them Nobody entered the study until
Henry carried a lamp in there after the others had retired for the
night He saw again the shadow on the wall leap to an awful life
before the light

The next morning at breakfast Henry Glynn announced that he had to go
to the city for three days The sisters looked at him with surprise
He very seldom left home and just now his practice had been neglected
on account of Edwards death He was a physician

How can you leave your patients now asked Mrs Brigham wonderingly

I dont know how to but there is no other way replied Henry easily
I have had a telegram from Doctor Mitford

Consultation inquired Mrs Brigham

I have business replied Henry

Doctor Mitford was an old classmate of his who lived in a neighbouring
city and who occasionally called upon him in the case of a consultation

After he had gone Mrs Brigham said to Caroline that after all Henry
had not said that he was going to consult with Doctor Mitford and she
thought it very strange

Everything is very strange said Rebecca with a shudder

What do you mean inquired Caroline sharply

Nothing replied Rebecca

Nobody entered the library that day nor the next nor the next The
third day Henry was expected home but he did not arrive and the last
train from the city had come

I call it pretty queer work said Mrs Brigham The idea of a
doctor leaving his patients for three days anyhow at such a time as
this and I know he has some very sick ones he said so And the idea
of a consultation lasting three days There is no sense in it and NOW
he has not come I dont understand it for my part

I dont either said Rebecca

They were all in the south parlour There was no light in the study
opposite and the door was ajar

Presently Mrs Brigham roseshe could not have told why something
seemed to impel her some will outside her own She went out of the
room again wrapping her rustling skirts around that she might pass
noiselessly and began pushing at the swollen door of the study

She has not got any lamp said Rebecca in a shaking voice

Caroline who was writing letters rose again took a lamp there were
two in the room and followed her sister Rebecca had risen but she
stood trembling not venturing to follow

The doorbell rang but the others did not hear it it was on the south
door on the other side of the house from the study Rebecca after
hesitating until the bell rang the second time went to the door she
remembered that the servant was out

Caroline and her sister Emma entered the study Caroline set the lamp
on the table They looked at the wall Oh my God gasped Mrs
Brigham there arethere are TWOshadows The sisters stood
clutching each other staring at the awful things on the wall Then
Rebecca came in staggering with a telegram in her hand Here isa
telegram she gasped Henry isdead




LUELLA MILLER


Close to the village street stood the onestory house in which Luella
Miller who had an evil name in the village had dwelt She had been
dead for years yet there were those in the village who in spite of
the clearer light which comes on a vantagepoint from a longpast
danger half believed in the tale which they had heard from their
childhood In their hearts although they scarcely would have owned
it was a survival of the wild horror and frenzied fear of their
ancestors who had dwelt in the same age with Luella Miller Young
people even would stare with a shudder at the old house as they passed
and children never played around it as was their wont around an
untenanted building Not a window in the old Miller house was broken
the panes reflected the morning sunlight in patches of emerald and
blue and the latch of the sagging front door was never lifted
although no bolt secured it Since Luella Miller had been carried out
of it the house had had no tenant except one friendless old soul who
had no choice between that and the faroff shelter of the open sky
This old woman who had survived her kindred and friends lived in the
house one week then one morning no smoke came out of the chimney and
a body of neighbours a score strong entered and found her dead in her
bed There were dark whispers as to the cause of her death and there
were those who testified to an expression of fear so exalted that it
showed forth the state of the departing soul upon the dead face The
old woman had been hale and hearty when she entered the house and in
seven days she was dead it seemed that she had fallen a victim to some
uncanny power The minister talked in the pulpit with covert severity
against the sin of superstition still the belief prevailed Not a
soul in the village but would have chosen the almshouse rather than
that dwelling No vagrant if he heard the tale would seek shelter
beneath that old roof unhallowed by nearly half a century of
superstitious fear

There was only one person in the village who had actually known Luella
Miller That person was a woman well over eighty but a marvel of
vitality and unextinct youth Straight as an arrow with the spring of
one recently let loose from the bow of life she moved about the
streets and she always went to church rain or shine She had never
married and had lived alone for years in a house across the road from
Luella Millers

This woman had none of the garrulousness of age but never in all her
life had she ever held her tongue for any will save her own and she
never spared the truth when she essayed to present it She it was who
bore testimony to the life evil though possibly wittingly or
designedly so of Luella Miller and to her personal appearance When
this old woman spokeand she had the gift of description although her
thoughts were clothed in the rude vernacular of her native villageone
could seem to see Luella Miller as she had really looked According to
this woman Lydia Anderson by name Luella Miller had been a beauty of
a type rather unusual in New England She had been a slight pliant
sort of creature as ready with a strong yielding to fate and as
unbreakable as a willow She had glimmering lengths of straight fair
hair which she wore softly looped round a long lovely face She had
blue eyes full of soft pleading little slender clinging hands and a
wonderful grace of motion and attitude

Luella Miller used to sit in a way nobody else could if they sat up
and studied a week of Sundays said Lydia Anderson and it was a
sight to see her walk If one of them willows over there on the edge
of the brook could start up and get its roots free of the ground and
move off it would go just the way Luella Miller used to She had a
green shot silk she used to wear too and a hat with green ribbon
streamers and a lace veil blowing across her face and out sideways
and a green ribbon flyin from her waist That was what she came out
bride in when she married Erastus Miller Her name before she was
married was Hill There was always a sight of ls in her name
married or single Erastus Miller was good lookin too better
lookin than Luella Sometimes I used to think that Luella want so
handsome after all Erastus just about worshiped her I used to know
him pretty well He lived next door to me and we went to school
together Folks used to say he was waitin on me but he want I
never thought he was except once or twice when he said things that some
girls might have suspected meant somethin That was before Luella
came here to teach the district school It was funny how she came to
get it for folks said she hadnt any education and that one of the
big girls Lottie Henderson used to do all the teachin for her while
she sat back and did embroidery work on a cambric pockethandkerchief
Lottie Henderson was a real smart girl a splendid scholar and she
just set her eyes by Luella as all the girls did Lottie would have
made a real smart woman but she died when Luella had been here about a
yearjust faded away and died nobody knew what ailed her She
dragged herself to that schoolhouse and helped Luella teach till the
very last minute The committee all knew how Luella didnt do much of
the work herself but they winked at it It want long after Lottie
died that Erastus married her I always thought he hurried it up
because she want fit to teach One of the big boys used to help her
after Lottie died but he hadnt much government and the school didnt
do very well and Luella might have had to give it up for the
committee couldnt have shut their eyes to things much longer The boy
that helped her was a real honest innocent sort of fellow and he was
a good scholar too Folks said he overstudied and that was the
reason he was took crazy the year after Luella married but I dont
know And I dont know what made Erastus Miller go into consumption of
the blood the year after he was married consumption want in his
family He just grew weaker and weaker and went almost bent double
when he tried to wait on Luella and he spoke feeble like an old man
He worked terrible hard till the last trying to save up a little to
leave Luella Ive seen him out in the worst storms on a woodsledhe
used to cut and sell woodand he was hunched up on top lookin more
dead than alive Once I couldnt stand it I went over and helped him
pitch some wood on the cartI was always strong in my arms I
wouldnt stop for all he told me to and I guess he was glad enough for
the help That was only a week before he died He fell on the kitchen
floor while he was gettin breakfast He always got the breakfast and
let Luella lay abed He did all the sweepin and the washin and the
ironin and most of the cookin He couldnt bear to have Luella lift
her finger and she let him do for her She lived like a queen for all
the work she did She didnt even do her sewin She said it made her
shoulder ache to sew and poor Erastuss sister Lily used to do all her
sewin She want able to either she was never strong in her back
but she did it beautifully She had to to suit Luella she was so
dreadful particular I never saw anythin like the fagottin and
hemstitchin that Lily Miller did for Luella She made all Luellas
weddin outfit and that green silk dress after Maria Babbit cut it
Maria she cut it for nothin and she did a lot more cuttin and
fittin for nothin for Luella too Lily Miller went to live with
Luella after Erastus died She gave up her home though she was real
attached to it and want a mite afraid to stay alone She rented it
and she went to live with Luella right away after the funeral

Then this old woman Lydia Anderson who remembered Luella Miller
would go on to relate the story of Lily Miller It seemed that on the
removal of Lily Miller to the house of her dead brother to live with
his widow the village people first began to talk This Lily Miller
had been hardly past her first youth and a most robust and blooming
woman rosycheeked with curls of strong black hair overshadowing
round candid temples and bright dark eyes It was not six months
after she had taken up her residence with her sisterinlaw that her
rosy colour faded and her pretty curves became wan hollows White
shadows began to show in the black rings of her hair and the light
died out of her eyes her features sharpened and there were pathetic
lines at her mouth which yet wore always an expression of utter
sweetness and even happiness She was devoted to her sister there was
no doubt that she loved her with her whole heart and was perfectly
content in her service It was her sole anxiety lest she should die and
leave her alone

The way Lily Miller used to talk about Luella was enough to make you
mad and enough to make you cry said Lydia Anderson Ive been in
there sometimes toward the last when she was too feeble to cook and
carried her some blancmange or custardsomethin I thought she might
relish and shed thank me and when I asked her how she was say she
felt better than she did yesterday and asked me if I didnt think she
looked better dreadful pitiful and say poor Luella had an awful time
takin care of her and doin the workshe want strong enough to do
anythinwhen all the time Luella want liftin her finger and poor
Lily didnt get any care except what the neighbours gave her and
Luella eat up everythin that was carried in for Lily I had it real
straight that she did Luella used to just sit and cry and do nothin
She did act real fond of Lily and she pined away considerable too
There was those that thought shed go into a decline herself But
after Lily died her Aunt Abby Mixter came and then Luella picked up
and grew as fat and rosy as ever But poor Aunt Abby begun to droop
just the way Lily had and I guess somebody wrote to her married
daughter Mrs Sam Abbot who lived in Barre for she wrote her mother
that she must leave right away and come and make her a visit but Aunt
Abby wouldnt go I can see her now She was a real goodlookin
woman tall and large with a big square face and a high forehead that
looked of itself kind of benevolent and good She just tended out on
Luella as if she had been a baby and when her married daughter sent
for her she wouldnt stir one inch Shed always thought a lot of her
daughter too but she said Luella needed her and her married daughter
didnt Her daughter kept writin and writin but it didnt do any
good Finally she came and when she saw how bad her mother looked
she broke down and cried and all but went on her knees to have her come
away She spoke her mind out to Luella too She told her that shed
killed her husband and everybody that had anythin to do with her and
shed thank her to leave her mother alone Luella went into hysterics
and Aunt Abby was so frightened that she called me after her daughter
went Mrs Sam Abbot she went away fairly cryin out loud in the
buggy the neighbours heard her and well she might for she never saw
her mother again alive I went in that night when Aunt Abby called for
me standin in the door with her little greenchecked shawl over her
head I can see her now Do come over here Miss Anderson she sung
out kind of gasping for breath I didnt stop for anythin I put
over as fast as I could and when I got there there was Luella
laughin and cryin all together and Aunt Abby trying to hush her and
all the time she herself was white as a sheet and shakin so she could
hardly stand For the land sakes Mrs Mixter says I you look
worse than she does You aint fit to be up out of your bed

Oh there aint anythin the matter with me says she Then she
went on talkin to Luella There there dont dont poor little
lamb says she Aunt Abby is here She aint goin away and leave
you Dont poor little lamb

Do leave her with me Mrs Mixter and you get back to bed says I
for Aunt Abby had been layin down considerable lately though somehow
she contrived to do the work

Im well enough says she Dont you think she had better have the
doctor Miss Anderson

The doctor says I I think YOU had better have the doctor I
think you need him much worse than some folks I could mention And I
looked right straight at Luella Miller laughin and cryin and goin on
as if she was the centre of all creation All the time she was actin
soseemed as if she was too sick to sense anythinshe was keepin a
sharp lookout as to how we took it out of the corner of one eye I see
her You could never cheat me about Luella Miller Finally I got real
mad and I run home and I got a bottle of valerian I had and I poured
some boilin hot water on a handful of catnip and I mixed up that
catnip tea with most half a wineglass of valerian and I went with it
over to Luellas I marched right up to Luella aholdin out of that
cup all smokin Now says I Luella Miller YOU SWALLER THIS

What iswhat is it oh what is it she sort of screeches out Then
she goes off alaughin enough to kill

Poor lamb poor little lamb says Aunt Abby standin over her all
kind of tottery and tryin to bathe her head with camphor

YOU SWALLER THIS RIGHT DOWN says I And I didnt waste any
ceremony I just took hold of Luella Millers chin and I tipped her
head back and I caught her mouth open with laughin and I clapped
that cup to her lips and I fairly hollered at her Swaller swaller
swaller and she gulped it right down She had to and I guess it did
her good Anyhow she stopped cryin and laughin and let me put her
to bed and she went to sleep like a baby inside of half an hour That
was more than poor Aunt Abby did She lay awake all that night and I
stayed with her though she tried not to have me said she want sick
enough for watchers But I stayed and I made some good cornmeal gruel
and I fed her a teaspoon every little while all night long It seemed
to me as if she was jest dyin from bein all wore out In the mornin
as soon as it was light I run over to the Bisbees and sent Johnny
Bisbee for the doctor I told him to tell the doctor to hurry and he
come pretty quick Poor Aunt Abby didnt seem to know much of anythin
when he got there You couldnt hardly tell she breathed she was so
used up When the doctor had gone Luella came into the room lookin
like a baby in her ruffled nightgown I can see her now Her eyes
were as blue and her face all pink and white like a blossom and she
looked at Aunt Abby in the bed sort of innocent and surprised Why
says she Aunt Abby aint got up yet

No she aint says I pretty short

I thought I didnt smell the coffee says Luella

Coffee says I I guess if you have coffee this mornin youll
make it yourself

I never made the coffee in all my life says she dreadful
astonished Erastus always made the coffee as long as he lived and
then Lily she made it and then Aunt Abby made it I dont believe I
CAN make the coffee Miss Anderson

You can make it or go without jest as you please says I

Aint Aunt Abby goin to get up says she

I guess she wont get up says I sick as she is I was gettin
madder and madder There was somethin about that little
pinkandwhite thing standin there and talkin about coffee when she
had killed so many better folks than she was and had jest killed
another that made me feel most as if I wished somebody would up and
kill her before she had a chance to do any more harm

Is Aunt Abby sick says Luella as if she was sort of aggrieved and
injured

Yes says I shes sick and shes goin to die and then youll be
left alone and youll have to do for yourself and wait on yourself or
do without things I dont know but I was sort of hard but it was
the truth and if I was any harder than Luella Miller had been Ill
give up I aint never been sorry that I said it Well Luella she
up and had hysterics again at that and I jest let her have em All I
did was to bundle her into the room on the other side of the entry
where Aunt Abby couldnt hear her if she want past itI dont know
but she wasand set her down hard in a chair and told her not to come
back into the other room and she minded She had her hysterics in
there till she got tired When she found out that nobody was comin to
coddle her and do for her she stopped At least I suppose she did I
had all I could do with poor Aunt Abby tryin to keep the breath of
life in her The doctor had told me that she was dreadful low and
give me some very strong medicine to give to her in drops real often
and told me real particular about the nourishment Well I did as he
told me real faithful till she want able to swaller any longer Then
I had her daughter sent for I had begun to realize that she wouldnt
last any time at all I hadnt realized it before though I spoke to
Luella the way I did The doctor he came and Mrs Sam Abbot but when
she got there it was too late her mother was dead Aunt Abbys
daughter just give one look at her mother layin there then she turned
sort of sharp and sudden and looked at me

Where is she says she and I knew she meant Luella

Shes out in the kitchen says I Shes too nervous to see folks
die Shes afraid it will make her sick

The Doctor he speaks up then He was a young man Old Doctor Park
had died the year before and this was a young fellow just out of
college Mrs Miller is not strong says he kind of severe and
she is quite right in not agitating herself

You are another young man shes got her pretty claw on you thinks
I but I didnt say anythin to him I just said over to Mrs Sam
Abbot that Luella was in the kitchen and Mrs Sam Abbot she went out
there and I went too and I never heard anythin like the way she
talked to Luella Miller I felt pretty hard to Luella myself but this
was more than I ever would have dared to say Luella she was too
scared to go into hysterics She jest flopped She seemed to jest
shrink away to nothin in that kitchen chair with Mrs Sam Abbot
standin over her and talkin and tellin her the truth I guess the
truth was most too much for her and no mistake because Luella
presently actually did faint away and there want any sham about it
the way I always suspected there was about them hysterics She fainted
dead away and we had to lay her flat on the floor and the Doctor he
came runnin out and he said somethin about a weak heart dreadful
fierce to Mrs Sam Abbot but she want a mite scared She faced him
jest as white as even Luella was layin there lookin like death and
the Doctor feelin of her pulse

Weak heart says she weak heart weak fiddlesticks There aint
nothin weak about that woman Shes got strength enough to hang onto
other folks till she kills em Weak It was my poor mother that was
weak this woman killed her as sure as if she had taken a knife to her

But the Doctor he didnt pay much attention He was bendin over
Luella layin there with her yellow hair all streamin and her pretty
pinkandwhite face all pale and her blue eyes like stars gone out
and he was holdin onto her hand and smoothin her forehead and
tellin me to get the brandy in Aunt Abbys room and I was sure as I
wanted to be that Luella had got somebody else to hang onto now Aunt
Abby was gone and I thought of poor Erastus Miller and I sort of
pitied the poor young Doctor led away by a pretty face and I made up
my mind Id see what I could do

I waited till Aunt Abby had been dead and buried about a month and
the Doctor was goin to see Luella steady and folks were beginnin to
talk then one evenin when I knew the Doctor had been called out of
town and wouldnt be round I went over to Luellas I found her all
dressed up in a blue muslin with white polka dots on it and her hair
curled jest as pretty and there want a young girl in the place could
compare with her There was somethin about Luella Miller seemed to
draw the heart right out of you but she didnt draw it out of ME She
was settin rocking in the chair by her sittinroom window and Maria
Brown had gone home Maria Brown had been in to help her or rather to
do the work for Luella want helped when she didnt do anythin
Maria Brown was real capable and she didnt have any ties she want
married and lived alone so shed offered I couldnt see why she
should do the work any more than Luella she want any too strong but
she seemed to think she could and Luella seemed to think so too so
she went over and did all the workwashed and ironed and baked
while Luella sat and rocked Maria didnt live long afterward She
began to fade away just the same fashion the others had Well she was
warned but she acted real mad when folks said anythin said Luella
was a poor abused woman too delicate to help herself and theyd
ought to be ashamed and if she died helpin them that couldnt help
themselves she wouldand she did

I spose Maria has gone home says I to Luella when I had gone in
and sat down opposite her

Yes Maria went half an hour ago after she had got supper and washed
the dishes says Luella in her pretty way

I suppose she has got a lot of work to do in her own house tonight
says I kind of bitter but that was all thrown away on Luella Miller
It seemed to her right that other folks that want any better able
than she was herself should wait on her and she couldnt get it
through her head that anybody should think it WANT right

Yes says Luella real sweet and pretty yes she said she had to
do her washin tonight She has let it go for a fortnight along of
comin over here

Why dont she stay home and do her washin instead of comin over
here and doin YOUR work when you are just as well able and enough
sight more so than she is to do it says I

Then Luella she looked at me like a baby who has a rattle shook at it
She sort of laughed as innocent as you please Oh I cant do the
work myself Miss Anderson says she I never did Maria HAS to do
it

Then I spoke out Has to do it I says I Has to do it She dont
have to do it either Maria Brown has her own home and enough to live
on She aint beholden to you to come over here and slave for you and
kill herself

Luella she jest set and stared at me for all the world like a
dollbaby that was so abused that it was comin to life

Yes says I shes killin herself Shes goin to die just the
way Erastus did and Lily and your Aunt Abby Youre killin her jest
as you did them I dont know what there is about you but you seem to
bring a curse says I You kill everybody that is fool enough to
care anythin about you and do for you

She stared at me and she was pretty pale

And Maria aint the only one youre goin to kill says I Youre
goin to kill Doctor Malcom before youre done with him

Then a red colour came flamin all over her face I aint goin to
kill him either says she and she begun to cry

Yes you BE says I Then I spoke as I had never spoke before You
see I felt it on account of Erastus I told her that she hadnt any
business to think of another man after shed been married to one that
had died for her that she was a dreadful woman and she was thats
true enough but sometimes I have wondered lately if she knew itif
she want like a baby with scissors in its hand cuttin everybody
without knowin what it was doin

Luella she kept gettin paler and paler and she never took her eyes
off my face There was somethin awful about the way she looked at me
and never spoke one word After awhile I quit talkin and I went home
I watched that night but her lamp went out before nine oclock and
when Doctor Malcom came drivin past and sort of slowed up he see there
want any light and he drove along I saw her sort of shy out of
meetin the next Sunday too so he shouldnt go home with her and I
begun to think mebbe she did have some conscience after all It was
only a week after that that Maria Brown diedsort of sudden at the
last though everybody had seen it was comin Well then there was a
good deal of feelin and pretty dark whispers Folks said the days of
witchcraft had come again and they were pretty shy of Luella She
acted sort of offish to the Doctor and he didnt go there and there
want anybody to do anythin for her I dont know how she DID get
along I wouldnt go in there and offer to help hernot because I was
afraid of dyin like the rest but I thought she was just as well able
to do her own work as I was to do it for her and I thought it was
about time that she did it and stopped killin other folks But it
want very long before folks began to say that Luella herself was
goin into a decline jest the way her husband and Lily and Aunt Abby
and the others had and I saw myself that she looked pretty bad I
used to see her goin past from the store with a bundle as if she could
hardly crawl but I remembered how Erastus used to wait and tend when
he couldnt hardly put one foot before the other and I didnt go out
to help her

But at last one afternoon I saw the Doctor come drivin up like mad
with his medicine chest and Mrs Babbit came in after supper and said
that Luella was real sick

Id offer to go in and nurse her says she but Ive got my
children to consider and mebbe it aint true what they say but its
queer how many folks that have done for her have died

I didnt say anythin but I considered how she had been Erastuss
wife and how he had set his eyes by her and I made up my mind to go in
the next mornin unless she was better and see what I could do but
the next mornin I see her at the window and pretty soon she came
steppin out as spry as you please and a little while afterward Mrs
Babbit came in and told me that the Doctor had got a girl from out of
town a Sarah Jones to come there and she said she was pretty sure
that the Doctor was goin to marry Luella

I saw him kiss her in the door that night myself and I knew it was
true The woman came that afternoon and the way she flew around was a
caution I dont believe Luella had swept since Maria died She swept
and dusted and washed and ironed wet clothes and dusters and carpets
were flyin over there all day and every time Luella set her foot out
when the Doctor want there there was that Sarah Jones helpin of her
up and down the steps as if she hadnt learned to walk

Well everybody knew that Luella and the Doctor were goin to be
married but it want long before they began to talk about his lookin
so poorly jest as they had about the others and they talked about
Sarah Jones too

Well the Doctor did die and he wanted to be married first so as to
leave what little he had to Luella but he died before the minister
could get there and Sarah Jones died a week afterward

Well that wound up everything for Luella Miller Not another soul in
the whole town would lift a finger for her There got to be a sort of
panic Then she began to droop in good earnest She used to have to
go to the store herself for Mrs Babbit was afraid to let Tommy go for
her and Ive seen her goin past and stoppin every two or three steps
to rest Well I stood it as long as I could but one day I see her
comin with her arms full and stoppin to lean against the Babbit
fence and I run out and took her bundles and carried them to her
house Then I went home and never spoke one word to her though she
called after me dreadful kind of pitiful Well that night I was taken
sick with a chill and I was sick as I wanted to be for two weeks
Mrs Babbit had seen me run out to help Luella and she came in and told
me I was goin to die on account of it I didnt know whether I was or
not but I considered I had done right by Erastuss wife

That last two weeks Luella she had a dreadful hard time I guess She
was pretty sick and as near as I could make out nobody dared go near
her I dont know as she was really needin anythin very much for
there was enough to eat in her house and it was warm weather and she
made out to cook a little flour gruel every day I know but I guess
she had a hard time she that had been so petted and done for all her
life

When I got so I could go out I went over there one morning Mrs
Babbit had just come in to say she hadnt seen any smoke and she didnt
know but it was somebodys duty to go in but she couldnt help
thinkin of her children and I got right up though I hadnt been out
of the house for two weeks and I went in there and Luella she was
layin on the bed and she was dyin

She lasted all that day and into the night But I sat there after the
new doctor had gone away Nobody else dared to go there It was about
midnight that I left her for a minute to run home and get some medicine
I had been takin for I begun to feel rather bad

It was a full moon that night and just as I started out of my door to
cross the street back to Luellas I stopped short for I saw
something

Lydia Anderson at this juncture always said with a certain defiance
that she did not expect to be believed and then proceeded in a hushed
voice

I saw what I saw and I know I saw it and I will swear on my death
bed that I saw it I saw Luella Miller and Erastus Miller and Lily
and Aunt Abby and Maria and the Doctor and Sarah all goin out of
her door and all but Luella shone white in the moonlight and they
were all helpin her along till she seemed to fairly fly in the midst
of them Then it all disappeared I stood a minute with my heart
poundin then I went over there I thought of goin for Mrs Babbit
but I thought shed be afraid So I went alone though I knew what had
happened Luella was layin real peaceful dead on her bed

This was the story that the old woman Lydia Anderson told but the
sequel was told by the people who survived her and this is the tale
which has become folklore in the village

Lydia Anderson died when she was eightyseven She had continued
wonderfully hale and hearty for one of her years until about two weeks
before her death

One bright moonlight evening she was sitting beside a window in her
parlour when she made a sudden exclamation and was out of the house
and across the street before the neighbour who was taking care of her
could stop her She followed as fast as possible and found Lydia
Anderson stretched on the ground before the door of Luella Millers
deserted house and she was quite dead

The next night there was a red gleam of fire athwart the moonlight and
the old house of Luella Miller was burned to the ground Nothing is now
left of it except a few old cellar stones and a lilac bush and in
summer a helpless trail of morning glories among the weeds which might
be considered emblematic of Luella herself




THE SOUTHWEST CHAMBER


That schoolteacher from Acton is coming today said the elder Miss
Gill Sophia

So she is assented the younger Miss Gill Amanda

I have decided to put her in the southwest chamber said Sophia

Amanda looked at her sister with an expression of mingled doubt and
terror You dont suppose she would she began hesitatingly

Would what demanded Sophia sharply She was more incisive than her
sister Both were below the medium height and stout but Sophia was
firm where Amanda was flabby Amanda wore a baggy old muslin it was a
hot day and Sophia was uncompromisingly hooked up in a starched and
boned cambric over her high shelving figure

I didnt know but she would object to sleeping in that room as long
as Aunt Harriet died there such a little time ago faltered Amanda

Well said Sophia of all the silly notions If you are going to
pick out rooms in this house where nobody has died for the boarders
youll have your hands full Grandfather Ackley had seven children
four of them died here to my certain knowledge besides grandfather and
grandmother I think Greatgrandmother Ackley grandfathers mother
died here too she must have and Greatgrandfather Ackley and
grandfathers unmarried sister Greataunt Fanny Ackley I dont
believe theres a room nor a bed in this house that somebody hasnt
passed away in

Well I suppose I am silly to think of it and she had better go in
there said Amanda

I know she had The northeast room is small and hot and shes stout
and likely to feel the heat and shes saved money and is able to board
out summers and maybe shell come here another year if shes well
accommodated said Sophia Now I guess youd better go in there and
see if any dust has settled on anything since it was cleaned and open
the west windows and let the sun in while I see to that cake

Amanda went to her task in the southwest chamber while her sister
stepped heavily down the back stairs on her way to the kitchen

It seems to me you had better open the bed while you air and dust
then make it up again she called back

Yes sister Amanda answered shudderingly

Nobody knew how this elderly woman with the untrammeled imagination of
a child dreaded to enter the southwest chamber and yet she could not
have told why she had the dread She had entered and occupied rooms
which had been once tenanted by persons now dead The room which had
been hers in the little house in which she and her sister had lived
before coming here had been her dead mothers She had never reflected
upon the fact with anything but loving awe and reverence There had
never been any fear But this was different She entered and her
heart beat thickly in her ears Her hands were cold The room was a
very large one The four windows two facing south two west were
closed the blinds also The room was in a film of green gloom The
furniture loomed out vaguely The gilt frame of a blurred old
engraving on the wall caught a little light The white counterpane on
the bed showed like a blank page

Amanda crossed the room opened with a straining motion of her thin
back and shoulders one of the west windows and threw back the blind
Then the room revealed itself an apartment full of an aged and worn but
no less valid state Pieces of old mahogany swelled forth a
peacockpatterned chintz draped the bedstead This chintz also covered
a great easy chair which had been the favourite seat of the former
occupant of the room The closet door stood ajar Amanda noticed that
with wonder There was a glimpse of purple drapery floating from a peg
inside the closet Amanda went across and took down the garment
hanging there She wondered how her sister had happened to leave it
when she cleaned the room It was an old loose gown which had belonged
to her aunt She took it down shuddering and closed the closet door
after a fearful glance into its dark depths It was a long closet with
a strong odour of lovage The Aunt Harriet had had a habit of eating
lovage and had carried it constantly in her pocket There was very
likely some of the pleasant root in the pocket of the musty purple gown
which Amanda threw over the easy chair

Amanda perceived the odour with a start as if before an actual
presence Odour seems in a sense a vital part of a personality It can
survive the flesh to which it has clung like a persistent shadow
seeming to have in itself something of the substance of that to which
it pertained Amanda was always conscious of this fragrance of lovage
as she tidied the room She dusted the heavy mahogany pieces
punctiliously after she had opened the bed as her sister had directed
She spread fresh towels over the washstand and the bureau she made
the bed Then she thought to take the purple gown from the easy chair
and carry it to the garret and put it in the trunk with the other
articles of the dead womans wardrobe which had been packed away there
BUT THE PURPLE GOWN WAS NOT ON THE CHAIR

Amanda Gill was not a woman of strong convictions even as to her own
actions She directly thought that possibly she had been mistaken and
had not removed it from the closet She glanced at the closet door and
saw with surprise that it was open and she had thought she had closed
it but she instantly was not sure of that So she entered the closet
and looked for the purple gown IT WAS NOT THERE

Amanda Gill went feebly out of the closet and looked at the easy chair
again The purple gown was not there She looked wildly around the
room She went down on her trembling knees and peered under the bed
she opened the bureau drawers she looked again in the closet Then
she stood in the middle of the floor and fairly wrung her hands

What does it mean she said in a shocked whisper

She had certainly seen that loose purple gown of her dead Aunt
Harriets

There is a limit at which selfrefutation must stop in any sane person
Amanda Gill had reached it She knew that she had seen that purple
gown in that closet she knew that she had removed it and put it on the
easy chair She also knew that she had not taken it out of the room
She felt a curious sense of being inverted mentally It was as if all
her traditions and laws of life were on their heads Never in her
simple record had any garment not remained where she had placed it
unless removed by some palpable human agency

Then the thought occurred to her that possibly her sister Sophia might
have entered the room unobserved while her back was turned and removed
the dress A sensation of relief came over her Her blood seemed to
flow back into its usual channels the tension of her nerves relaxed

How silly I am she said aloud

She hurried out and downstairs into the kitchen where Sophia was making
cake stirring with splendid circular sweeps of a wooden spoon a creamy
yellow mass She looked up as her sister entered

Have you got it done said she

Yes replied Amanda Then she hesitated A sudden terror overcame
her It did not seem as if it were at all probable that Sophia had
left that foamy cake mixture a second to go to Aunt Harriets chamber
and remove that purple gown

Well said Sophia if you have got that done I wish you would take
hold and string those beans The first thing we know there wont be
time to boil them for dinner

Amanda moved toward the pan of beans on the table then she looked at
her sister

Did you come up in Aunt Harriets room while I was there she asked
weakly

She knew while she asked what the answer would be

Up in Aunt Harriets room Of course I didnt I couldnt leave this
cake without having it fall You know that well enough Why

Nothing replied Amanda

Suddenly she realized that she could not tell her sister what had
happened for before the utter absurdity of the whole thing her belief
in her own reason quailed She knew what Sophia would say if she told
her She could hear her

Amanda Gill have you gone stark staring mad

She resolved that she would never tell Sophia She dropped into a
chair and begun shelling the beans with nerveless fingers Sophia
looked at her curiously

Amanda Gill what on earth ails you she asked

Nothing replied Amanda She bent her head very low over the green
pods

Yes there is too You are as white as a sheet and your hands are
shaking so you can hardly string those beans I did think you had more
sense Amanda Gill

I dont know what you mean Sophia

Yes you do know what I mean too you neednt pretend you dont Why
did you ask me if I had been in that room and why do you act so queer

Amanda hesitated She had been trained to truth Then she lied

I wondered if youd noticed how it had leaked in on the paper over by
the bureau that last rain said she

What makes you look so pale then

I dont know I guess the heat sort of overcame me

I shouldnt think it could have been very hot in that room when it had
been shut up so long said Sophia

She was evidently not satisfied but then the grocer came to the door
and the matter dropped

For the next hour the two women were very busy They kept no servant
When they had come into possession of this fine old place by the death
of their aunt it had seemed a doubtful blessing There was not a cent
with which to pay for repairs and taxes and insurance except the
twelve hundred dollars which they had obtained from the sale of the
little house in which they had been born and lived all their lives
There had been a division in the old Ackley family years before One
of the daughters had married against her mothers wish and had been
disinherited She had married a poor man by the name of Gill and
shared his humble lot in sight of her former home and her sister and
mother living in prosperity until she had borne three daughters then
she died worn out with overwork and worry

The mother and the elder sister had been pitiless to the last Neither
had ever spoken to her since she left her home the night of her
marriage They were hard women

The three daughters of the disinherited sister had lived quiet and
poor but not actually needy lives Jane the middle daughter had
married and died in less than a year Amanda and Sophia had taken the
girl baby she left when the father married again Sophia had taught a
primary school for many years she had saved enough to buy the little
house in which they lived Amanda had crocheted lace and embroidered
flannel and made tidies and pincushions and had earned enough for her
clothes and the childs little Flora Scott

Their father William Gill had died before they were thirty and now
in their late middle life had come the death of the aunt to whom they
had never spoken although they had often seen her who had lived in
solitary state in the old Ackley mansion until she was more than
eighty There had been no will and they were the only heirs with the
exception of young Flora Scott the daughter of the dead sister

Sophia and Amanda thought directly of Flora when they knew of the
inheritance

It will be a splendid thing for her she will have enough to live on
when we are gone Sophia said

She had promptly decided what was to be done The small house was to
be sold and they were to move into the old Ackley house and take
boarders to pay for its keeping She scouted the idea of selling it
She had an enormous family pride She had always held her head high
when she had walked past that fine old mansion the cradle of her race
which she was forbidden to enter She was unmoved when the lawyer who
was advising her disclosed to her the fact that Harriet Ackley had used
every cent of the Ackley money

I realize that we have to work said she but my sister and I have
determined to keep the place

That was the end of the discussion Sophia and Amanda Gill had been
living in the old Ackley house a fortnight and they had three
boarders an elderly widow with a comfortable income a young
congregationalist clergyman and the middleaged single woman who had
charge of the village library Now the schoolteacher from Acton Miss
Louisa Stark was expected for the summer and would make four

Sophia considered that they were comfortably provided for Her wants
and her sisters were very few and even the niece although a young
girl had small expenses since her wardrobe was supplied for years to
come from that of the deceased aunt There were stored away in the
garret of the Ackley house enough voluminous black silks and satins and
bombazines to keep her clad in somber richness for years to come

Flora was a very gentle girl with large serious blue eyes a
seldomsmiling pretty mouth and smooth flaxen hair She was delicate
and very youngsixteen on her next birthday

She came home soon now with her parcels of sugar and tea from the
grocers She entered the kitchen gravely and deposited them on the
table by which her Aunt Amanda was seated stringing beans Flora wore
an obsolete turbanshaped hat of black straw which had belonged to the
dead aunt it set high like a crown revealing her forehead Her dress
was an ancient purpleandwhite print too long and too large except
over the chest where it held her like a straight waistcoat

You had better take off your hat Flora said Sophia She turned
suddenly to Amanda Did you fill the waterpitcher in that chamber
for the schoolteacher she asked severely She was quite sure that
Amanda had not filled the waterpitcher

Amanda blushed and started guiltily I declare I dont believe I
did said she

I didnt think you had said her sister with sarcastic emphasis

Flora you go up to the room that was your Greataunt Harriets and
take the waterpitcher off the washstand and fill it with water Be
real careful and dont break the pitcher and dont spill the water

In THAT chamber asked Flora She spoke very quietly but her face
changed a little

Yes in that chamber returned her Aunt Sophia sharply Go right
along

Flora went and her light footstep was heard on the stairs Very soon
she returned with the blueandwhite waterpitcher and filled it
carefully at the kitchen sink

Now be careful and not spill it said Sophia as she went out of the
room carrying it gingerly

Amanda gave a timidly curious glance at her she wondered if she had
seen the purple gown

Then she started for the village stagecoach was seen driving around to
the front of the house The house stood on a corner

Here Amanda you look better than I do you go and meet her said
Sophia Ill just put the cake in the pan and get it in the oven and
Ill come Show her right up to her room

Amanda removed her apron hastily and obeyed Sophia hurried with her
cake pouring it into the bakingtins She had just put it in the
oven when the door opened and Flora entered carrying the blue
waterpitcher

What are you bringing down that pitcher again for asked Sophia

She wants some water and Aunt Amanda sent me replied Flora

Her pretty pale face had a bewildered expression

For the land sake she hasnt used all that great pitcherful of water
so quick

There wasnt any water in it replied Flora

Her high childish forehead was contracted slightly with a puzzled
frown as she looked at her aunt

Wasnt any water in it

No maam

Didnt I see you filling the pitcher with water not ten minutes ago I
want to know

Yes maam

What did you do with that water

Nothing

Did you carry that pitcherful of water up to that room and set it on
the washstand

Yes maam

Didnt you spill it

No maam

Now Flora Scott I want the truth Did you fill that pitcher with
water and carry it up there and wasnt there any there when she came
to use it

Yes maam

Let me see that pitcher Sophia examined the pitcher It was not
only perfectly dry from top to bottom but even a little dusty She
turned severely on the young girl That shows said she you did
not fill the pitcher at all You let the water run at the side because
you didnt want to carry it upstairs I am ashamed of you Its bad
enough to be so lazy but when it comes to not telling the truth

The young girls face broke up suddenly into piteous confusion and her
blue eyes became filmy with tears

I did fill the pitcher honest she faltered I did Aunt Sophia
You ask Aunt Amanda

Ill ask nobody This pitcher is proof enough Water dont go off
and leave the pitcher dusty on the inside if it was put in ten minutes
ago Now you fill that pitcher full quick and you carry it upstairs
and if you spill a drop therell be something besides talk

Flora filled the pitcher with the tears falling over her cheeks She
sniveled softly as she went out balancing it carefully against her
slender hip Sophia followed her

Stop crying said she sharply you ought to be ashamed of yourself
What do you suppose Miss Louisa Stark will think No water in her
pitcher in the first place and then you come back crying as if you
didnt want to get it

In spite of herself Sophias voice was soothing She was very fond of
the girl She followed her up the stairs to the chamber where Miss
Louisa Stark was waiting for the water to remove the soil of travel
She had removed her bonnet and its tuft of red geraniums lightened the
obscurity of the mahogany dresser She had placed her little beaded
cape carefully on the bed She was replying to a tremulous remark of
Amandas who was nearly fainting from the new mystery of the
waterpitcher that it was warm and she suffered a good deal in warm
weather

Louisa Stark was stout and solidly built She was much larger than
either of the Gill sisters She was a masterly woman inured to command
from years of schoolteaching She carried her swelling bulk with
majesty even her face moist and red with the heat lost nothing of
its dignity of expression

She was standing in the middle of the floor with an air which gave the
effect of her standing upon an elevation She turned when Sophia and
Flora carrying the waterpitcher entered

This is my sister Sophia said Amanda tremulously

Sophia advanced shook hands with Miss Louisa Stark and bade her
welcome and hoped she would like her room Then she moved toward the
closet There is a nice large closet in this roomthe best closet in
the house You might have your trunk she said then she stopped
short

The closet door was ajar and a purple garment seemed suddenly to swing
into view as if impelled by some wind

Why here is something left in this closet Sophia said in a
mortified tone I thought all those things had been taken away

She pulled down the garment with a jerk and as she did so Amanda
passed her in a weak rush for the door

I am afraid your sister is not well said the schoolteacher from
Acton She looked very pale when you took that dress down I noticed
it at once Hadnt you better go and see what the matter is She may
be going to faint

She is not subject to fainting spells replied Sophia but she
followed Amanda

She found her in the room which they occupied together lying on the
bed very pale and gasping She leaned over her

Amanda what is the matter dont you feel well she asked

I feel a little faint

Sophia got a camphor bottle and began rubbing her sisters forehead

Do you feel better she said

Amanda nodded

I guess it was that green apple pie you ate this noon said Sophia
I declare what did I do with that dress of Aunt Harriets I guess
if you feel better Ill just run and get it and take it up garret
Ill stop in here again when I come down Youd better lay still
Flora can bring you up a cup of tea I wouldnt try to eat any supper

Sophias tone as she left the room was full of loving concern
Presently she returned she looked disturbed but angrily so There was
not the slightest hint of any fear in her expression

I want to know said she looking sharply and quickly around if I
brought that purple dress in here after all

I didnt see you replied Amanda

I must have It isnt in that chamber nor the closet You arent
lying on it are you

I lay down before you came in replied Amanda

So you did Well Ill go and look again

Presently Amanda heard her sisters heavy step on the garret stairs
Then she returned with a queer defiant expression on her face

I carried it up garret after all and put it in the trunk said
she I declare I forgot it I suppose your being faint sort of put
it out of my head There it was folded up just as nice right where I
put it

Sophias mouth was set her eyes upon her sisters scared agitated
face were full of hard challenge

Yes murmured Amanda

I must go right down and see to that cake said Sophia going out of
the room If you dont feel well you pound on the floor with the
umbrella

Amanda looked after her She knew that Sophia had not put that purple
dress of her dead Aunt Harriet in the trunk in the garret

Meantime Miss Louisa Stark was settling herself in the southwest
chamber She unpacked her trunk and hung her dresses carefully in the
closet She filled the bureau drawers with nicely folded linen and
small articles of dress She was a very punctilious woman She put on
a black India silk dress with purple flowers She combed her
grayishblond hair in smooth ridges back from her broad forehead She
pinned her lace at her throat with a brooch very handsome although
somewhat obsoletea bunch of pearl grapes on black onyx set in gold
filagree She had purchased it several years ago with a considerable
portion of the stipend from her spring term of schoolteaching

As she surveyed herself in the little swing mirror surmounting the
oldfashioned mahogany bureau she suddenly bent forward and looked
closely at the brooch It seemed to her that something was wrong with
it As she looked she became sure Instead of the familiar bunch of
pearl grapes on the black onyx she saw a knot of blonde and black hair
under glass surrounded by a border of twisted gold She felt a thrill
of horror though she could not tell why She unpinned the brooch and
it was her own familiar one the pearl grapes and the onyx How very
foolish I am she thought She thrust the pin in the laces at her
throat and again looked at herself in the glass and there it was
againthe knot of blond and black hair and the twisted gold

Louisa Stark looked at her own large firm face above the brooch and it
was full of terror and dismay which were new to it She straightway
began to wonder if there could be anything wrong with her mind She
remembered that an aunt of her mothers had been insane A sort of
fury with herself possessed her She stared at the brooch in the glass
with eyes at once angry and terrified Then she removed it again and
there was her own old brooch Finally she thrust the gold pin through
the lace again fastened it and turning a defiant back on the glass
went down to supper

At the supper table she met the other boardersthe elderly widow the
young clergyman and the middleaged librarian She viewed the elderly
widow with reserve the clergyman with respect the middleaged
librarian with suspicion The latter wore a very youthful shirtwaist
and her hair in a girlish fashion which the schoolteacher who twisted
hers severely from the straining roots at the nape of her neck to the
small smooth coil at the top condemned as straining after effects no
longer hers by right

The librarian who had a quick acridness of manner addressed her
asking what room she had and asked the second time in spite of the
schoolteachers evident reluctance to hear her She even since she
sat next to her nudged her familiarly in her rigid black silk side

What room are you in Miss Stark said she

I am at a loss how to designate the room replied Miss Stark stiffly

Is it the big southwest room

It evidently faces in that direction said Miss Stark

The librarian whose name was Eliza Lippincott turned abruptly to Miss
Amanda Gill over whose delicate face a curious colour compounded of
flush and pallour was stealing

What room did your aunt die in Miss Amanda asked she abruptly

Amanda cast a terrified glance at her sister who was serving a second
plate of pudding for the minister

That room she replied feebly

Thats what I thought said the librarian with a certain triumph I
calculated that must be the room she died in for its the best room in
the house and you havent put anybody in it before Somehow the room
that anybody has died in lately is generally the last room that anybody
is put in I suppose YOU are so strongminded you dont object to
sleeping in a room where anybody died a few weeks ago she inquired of
Louisa Stark with sharp eyes on her face

No I do not replied Miss stark with emphasis

Nor in the same bed persisted Eliza Lippincott with a kittenish
reflection

The young minister looked up from his pudding He was very spiritual
but he had had poor pickings in his previous boarding place and he
could not help a certain abstract enjoyment over Miss Gills cooking

You would certainly not be afraid Miss Lippincott he remarked with
his gentle almost caressing inflection of tone You do not for a
minute believe that a higher power would allow any manifestation on the
part of a disembodied spiritwho we trust is in her heavenly hometo
harm one of His servants

Oh Mr Dunn of course not replied Eliza Lippincott with a blush
Of course not I never meant to imply

I could not believe you did said the minister gently He was very
young but he already had a wrinkle of permanent anxiety between his
eyes and a smile of permanent ingratiation on his lips The lines of
the smile were as deeply marked as the wrinkle

Of course dear Miss Harriet Gill was a professing Christian remarked
the widow and I dont suppose a professing Christian would come back
and scare folks if she could I wouldnt be a mite afraid to sleep in
that room Id rather have it than the one Ive got If I was afraid
to sleep in a room where a good woman died I wouldnt tell of it If
I saw things or heard things Id think the fault must be with my own
guilty conscience Then she turned to Miss Stark Any time you feel
timid in that room Im ready and willing to change with you said she

Thank you I have no desire to change I am perfectly satisfied with
my room replied Miss Stark with freezing dignity which was thrown
away upon the widow

Well said she any time if you should feel timid you know what to
do Ive got a real nice room it faces east and gets the morning sun
but it isnt so nice as yours according to my way of thinking Id
rather take my chances any day in a room anybody had died in than in
one that was hot in summer Im more afraid of a sunstroke than of
spooks for my part

Miss Sophia Gill who had not spoken one word but whose mouth had
become more and more rigidly compressed suddenly rose from the table
forcing the minister to leave a little pudding at which he glanced
regretfully

Miss Louisa Stark did not sit down in the parlour with the other
boarders She went straight to her room She felt tired after her
journey and meditated a loose wrapper and writing a few letters
quietly before she went to bed Then too she was conscious of a
feeling that if she delayed the going there at all might assume more
terrifying proportions She was full of defiance against herself and
her own lurking weakness

So she went resolutely and entered the southwest chamber There was
through the room a soft twilight She could dimly discern everything
the white satin scrollwork on the wall paper and the white counterpane
on the bed being most evident Consequently both arrested her
attention first She saw against the wallpaper directly facing the
door the waist of her best black satin dress hung over a picture

That is very strange she said to herself and again a thrill of
vague horror came over her

She knew or thought she knew that she had put that black satin dress
waist away nicely folded between towels in her trunk She was very
choice of her black satin dress

She took down the black waist and laid it on the bed preparatory to
folding it but when she attempted to do so she discovered that the two
sleeves were firmly sewed together Louisa Stark stared at the sewed
sleeves What does this mean she asked herself She examined the
sewing carefully the stitches were small and even and firm of black
silk

She looked around the room On the stand beside the bed was something
which she had not noticed before a little oldfashioned workbox with
a picture of a little boy in a pinafore on the top Beside this
workbox lay as if just laid down by the user a spool of black silk
a pair of scissors and a large steel thimble with a hole in the top
after an old style Louisa stared at these then at the sleeves of her
dress She moved toward the door For a moment she thought that this
was something legitimate about which she might demand information then
she became doubtful Suppose that workbox had been there all the
time suppose she had forgotten suppose she herself had done this
absurd thing or suppose that she had not what was to hinder the
others from thinking so what was to hinder a doubt being cast upon her
own memory and reasoning powers

Louisa Stark had been on the verge of a nervous breakdown in spite of
her iron constitution and her great will power No woman can teach
school for forty years with absolute impunity She was more credulous
as to her own possible failings than she had ever been in her whole
life She was cold with horror and terror and yet not so much horror
and terror of the supernatural as of her own self The weakness of
belief in the supernatural was nearly impossible for this strong
nature She could more easily believe in her own failing powers

I dont know but Im going to be like Aunt Marcia she said to
herself and her fat face took on a long rigidity of fear

She started toward the mirror to unfasten her dress then she
remembered the strange circumstance of the brooch and stopped short
Then she straightened herself defiantly and marched up to the bureau
and looked in the glass She saw reflected therein fastening the lace
at her throat the oldfashioned thing of a large oval a knot of fair
and black hair under glass set in a rim of twisted gold She
unfastened it with trembling fingers and looked at it It was her own
brooch the cluster of pearl grapes on black onyx Louisa Stark placed
the trinket in its little box on the nest of pink cotton and put it
away in the bureau drawer Only death could disturb her habit of order

Her fingers were so cold they felt fairly numb as she unfastened her
dress she staggered when she slipped it over her head She went to
the closet to hang it up and recoiled A strong smell of lovage came
in her nostrils a purple gown near the door swung softly against her
face as if impelled by some wind from within All the pegs were filled
with garments not her own mostly of somber black but there were some
strangepatterned silk things and satins

Suddenly Louisa Stark recovered her nerve This she told herself was
something distinctly tangible Somebody had been taking liberties with
her wardrobe Somebody had been hanging some one elses clothes in her
closet She hastily slipped on her dress again and marched straight
down to the parlour The people were seated there the widow and the
minister were playing backgammon The librarian was watching them
Miss Amanda Gill was mending beside the large lamp on the centre table
They all looked up with amazement as Louisa Stark entered There was
something strange in her expression She noticed none of them except
Amanda

Where is your sister she asked peremptorily of her

Shes in the kitchen mixing up bread Amanda quavered is there
anything But the schoolteacher was gone

She found Sophia Gill standing by the kitchen table kneading dough with
dignity The young girl Flora was bringing some flour from the pantry
She stopped and stared at Miss Stark and her pretty delicate young
face took on an expression of alarm

Miss Stark opened at once upon the subject in her mind

Miss Gill said she with her utmost schoolteacher manner I wish
to inquire why you have had my own clothes removed from the closet in
my room and others substituted

Sophia Gill stood with her hands fast in the dough regarding her Her
own face paled slowly and reluctantly her mouth stiffened

What I dont quite understand what you mean Miss Stark said she

My clothes are not in the closet in my room and it is full of things
which do not belong to me said Louisa Stark

Bring me that flour said Sophia sharply to the young girl who
obeyed casting timid startled glances at Miss Stark as she passed
her Sophia Gill began rubbing her hands clear of the dough I am
sure I know nothing about it she said with a certain tempered
asperity Do you know anything about it Flora

Oh no I dont know anything about it Aunt Sophia answered the
young girl fluttering

Then Sophia turned to Miss Stark Ill go upstairs with you Miss
Stark said she and see what the trouble is There must be some
mistake She spoke stiffly with constrained civility

Very well said Miss Stark with dignity Then she and Miss Sophia
went upstairs Flora stood staring after them

Sophia and Louisa Stark went up to the southwest chamber The closet
door was shut Sophia threw it open then she looked at Miss Stark
On the pegs hung the schoolteachers own garments in ordinary array

I cant see that there is anything wrong remarked Sophia grimly

Miss Stark strove to speak but she could not She sank down on the
nearest chair She did not even attempt to defend herself She saw
her own clothes in the closet She knew there had been no time for any
human being to remove those which she thought she had seen and put hers
in their places She knew it was impossible Again the awful horror
of herself overwhelmed her

You must have been mistaken she heard Sophia say

She muttered something she scarcely knew what Sophia then went out
of the room Presently she undressed and went to bed In the morning
she did not go down to breakfast and when Sophia came to inquire
requested that the stage be ordered for the noon train She said that
she was sorry but was ill and feared lest she might be worse and she
felt that she must return home at once She looked ill and could not
take even the toast and tea which Sophia had prepared for her Sophia
felt a certain pity for her but it was largely mixed with indignation
She felt that she knew the true reason for the schoolteachers illness
and sudden departure and it incensed her

If folks are going to act like fools we shall never be able to keep
this house she said to Amanda after Miss Stark had gone and Amanda
knew what she meant

Directly the widow Mrs Elvira Simmons knew that the schoolteacher
had gone and the southwest room was vacant she begged to have it in
exchange for her own Sophia hesitated a moment she eyed the widow
sharply There was something about the large roseate face worn in
firm lines of humour and decision which reassured her

I have no objection Mrs Simmons said she if

If what asked the widow

If you have common sense enough not to keep fussing because the room
happens to be the one my aunt died in said Sophia bluntly

Fiddlesticks said the widow Mrs Elvira Simmons

That very afternoon she moved into the southwest chamber The young
girl Flora assisted her though much against her will

Now I want you to carry Mrs Simmons dresses into the closet in that
room and hang them up nicely and see that she has everything she
wants said Sophia Gill And you can change the bed and put on fresh
sheets What are you looking at me that way for

Oh Aunt Sophia cant I do something else

What do you want to do something else for

I am afraid

Afraid of what I should think youd hang your head No you go
right in there and do what I tell you

Pretty soon Flora came running into the sittingroom where Sophia was
as pale as death and in her hand she held a queer oldfashioned
frilled nightcap

Whats that demanded Sophia

I found it under the pillow

What pillow

In the southwest room

Sophia took it and looked at it sternly

Its Greataunt Harriets said Flora faintly

You run down street and do that errand at the grocers for me and Ill
see that room said Sophia with dignity She carried the nightcap
away and put it in the trunk in the garret where she had supposed it
stored with the rest of the dead womans belongings Then she went into
the southwest chamber and made the bed and assisted Mrs Simmons to
move and there was no further incident

The widow was openly triumphant over her new room She talked a deal
about it at the dinnertable

It is the best room in the house and I expect you all to be envious
of me said she

And you are sure you dont feel afraid of ghosts said the librarian

Ghosts repeated the widow with scorn If a ghost comes Ill send
her over to you You are just across the hall from the southwest room

You neednt returned Eliza Lippincott with a shudder I wouldnt
sleep in that room after she checked herself with an eye on the
minister

After what asked the widow

Nothing replied Eliza Lippincott in an embarrassed fashion

I trust Miss Lippincott has too good sense and too great faith to
believe in anything of that sort said the minister

I trust so too replied Eliza hurriedly

You did see or hear somethingnow what was it I want to know said
the widow that evening when they were alone in the parlour The
minister had gone to make a call

Eliza hesitated

What was it insisted the widow

Well said Eliza hesitatingly if youll promise not to tell

Yes I promise what was it

Well one day last week just before the schoolteacher came I went
in that room to see if there were any clouds I wanted to wear my gray
dress and I was afraid it was going to rain so I wanted to look at
the sky at all points so I went in there and

And what

Well you know that chintz over the bed and the valance and the easy
chair what pattern should you say it was

Why peacocks on a blue ground Good land I shouldnt think any one
who had ever seen that would forget it

Peacocks on a blue ground you are sure

Of course I am Why

Only when I went in there that afternoon it was not peacocks on a blue
ground it was great red roses on a yellow ground

Why what do you mean

What I say

Did Miss Sophia have it changed

No I went in there again an hour later and the peacocks were there

You didnt see straight the first time

I expected you would say that

The peacocks are there now I saw them just now

Yes I suppose so I suppose they flew back

But they couldnt

Looks as if they did

Why how could such a thing be It couldnt be

Well all I know is those peacocks were gone for an hour that
afternoon and the red roses on the yellow ground were there instead

The widow stared at her a moment then she began to laugh rather
hysterically

Well said she I guess I shant give up my nice room for any such
tomfoolery as that I guess I would just as soon have red roses on a
yellow ground as peacocks on a blue but theres no use talking you
couldnt have seen straight How could such a thing have happened

I dont know said Eliza Lippincott but I know I wouldnt sleep in
that room if youd give me a thousand dollars

Well I would said the widow and Im going to

When Mrs Simmons went to the southwest chamber that night she cast a
glance at the bedhanging and the easy chair There were the peacocks
on the blue ground She gave a contemptuous thought to Eliza
Lippincott

I dont believe but shes getting nervous she thought I wonder if
any of her family have been out at all

But just before Mrs Simmons was ready to get into bed she looked again
at the hangings and the easy chair and there were the red roses on the
yellow ground instead of the peacocks on the blue She looked long and
sharply Then she shut her eyes and then opened them and looked She
still saw the red roses Then she crossed the room turned her back to
the bed and looked out at the night from the south window It was
clear and the full moon was shining She watched it a moment sailing
over the dark blue in its nimbus of gold Then she looked around at
the bed hangings She still saw the red roses on the yellow ground

Mrs Simmons was struck in her most vulnerable point This apparent
contradiction of the reasonable as manifested in such a commonplace
thing as chintz of a bedhanging affected this ordinarily unimaginative
woman as no ghostly appearance could have done Those red roses on the
yellow ground were to her much more ghostly than any strange figure
clad in the white robes of the grave entering the room

She took a step toward the door then she turned with a resolute air
As for going downstairs and owning up Im scared and having that
Lippincott girl crowing over me I wont for any red roses instead of
peacocks I guess they cant hurt me and as long as weve both of us
seen em I guess we cant both be getting loony she said

Mrs Elvira Simmons blew out her light and got into bed and lay staring
out between the chintz hangings at the moonlit room She said her
prayers in bed always as being more comfortable and presumably just as
acceptable in the case of a faithful servant with a stout habit of
body Then after a little she fell asleep she was of too practical a
nature to be kept long awake by anything which had no power of actual
bodily effect upon her No stress of the spirit had ever disturbed her
slumbers So she slumbered between the red roses or the peacocks she
did not know which

But she was awakened about midnight by a strange sensation in her
throat She had dreamed that some one with long white fingers was
strangling her and she saw bending over her the face of an old woman
in a white cap When she waked there was no old woman the room was
almost as light as day in the full moonlight and looked very peaceful
but the strangling sensation at her throat continued and besides that
her face and ears felt muffled She put up her hand and felt that her
head was covered with a ruffled nightcap tied under her chin so tightly
that it was exceedingly uncomfortable A great qualm of horror shot
over her She tore the thing off frantically and flung it from her
with a convulsive effort as if it had been a spider She gave as she
did so a quick short scream of terror She sprang out of bed and was
going toward the door when she stopped

It had suddenly occurred to her that Eliza Lippincott might have
entered the room and tied on the cap while she was asleep She had not
locked her door She looked in the closet under the bed there was no
one there Then she tried to open the door but to her astonishment
found that it was lockedbolted on the inside I must have locked it
after all she reflected with wonder for she never locked her door
Then she could scarcely conceal from herself that there was something
out of the usual about it all Certainly no one could have entered the
room and departed locking the door on the inside She could not
control the long shiver of horror that crept over her but she was
still resolute She resolved that she would throw the cap out of the
window Ill see if I have tricks like that played on me I dont
care who does it said she quite aloud She was still unable to
believe wholly in the supernatural The idea of some human agency was
still in her mind filling her with anger

She went toward the spot where she had thrown the capshe had stepped
over it on her way to the doorbut it was not there She searched the
whole room lighting her lamp but she could not find the cap Finally
she gave it up She extinguished her lamp and went back to bed She
fell asleep again to be again awakened in the same fashion That time
she tore off the cap as before but she did not fling it on the floor
as before Instead she held to it with a fierce grip Her blood was
up

Holding fast to the white flimsy thing she sprang out of bed ran to
the window which was open slipped the screen and flung it out but a
sudden gust of wind though the night was calm arose and it floated
back in her face She brushed it aside like a cobweb and she clutched
at it She was actually furious It eluded her clutching fingers
Then she did not see it at all She examined the floor she lighted
her lamp again and searched but there was no sign of it

Mrs Simmons was then in such a rage that all terror had disappeared
for the time She did not know with what she was angry but she had a
sense of some mocking presence which was silently proving too strong
against her weakness and she was aroused to the utmost power of
resistance To be baffled like this and resisted by something which
was as nothing to her straining senses filled her with intensest
resentment

Finally she got back into bed again she did not go to sleep She felt
strangely drowsy but she fought against it She was wide awake
staring at the moonlight when she suddenly felt the soft white strings
of the thing tighten around her throat and realized that her enemy was
again upon her She seized the strings untied them twitched off the
cap ran with it to the table where her scissors lay and furiously cut
it into small bits She cut and tore feeling an insane fury of
gratification

There said she quite aloud I guess I shant have any more
trouble with this old cap

She tossed the bits of muslin into a basket and went back to bed
Almost immediately she felt the soft strings tighten around her throat
Then at last she yielded vanquished This new refutal of all laws of
reason by which she had learned as it were to spell her theory of
life was too much for her equilibrium She pulled off the clinging
strings feebly drew the thing from her head slid weakly out of bed
caught up her wrapper and hastened out of the room She went
noiselessly along the hall to her own old room she entered got into
her familiar bed and lay there the rest of the night shuddering and
listening and if she dozed waking with a start at the feeling of the
pressure upon her throat to find that it was not there yet still to be
unable to shake off entirely the horror

When daylight came she crept back to the southwest chamber and
hurriedly got some clothes in which to dress herself It took all her
resolution to enter the room but nothing unusual happened while she
was there She hastened back to her old chamber dressed herself and
went down to breakfast with an imperturbable face Her colour had not
faded When asked by Eliza Lippincott how she had slept she replied
with an appearance of calmness which was bewildering that she had not
slept very well She never did sleep very well in a new bed and she
thought she would go back to her old room

Eliza Lippincott was not deceived however neither were the Gill
sisters nor the young girl Flora Eliza Lippincott spoke out bluntly

You neednt talk to me about sleeping well said she I know
something queer happened in that room last night by the way you act

They all looked at Mrs Simmons inquiringlythe librarian with
malicious curiosity and triumph the minister with sad incredulity
Sophia Gill with fear and indignation Amanda and the young girl with
unmixed terror The widow bore herself with dignity

I saw nothing nor heard nothing which I trust could not have been
accounted for in some rational manner said she

What was it persisted Eliza Lippincott

I do not wish to discuss the matter any further replied Mrs Simmons
shortly Then she passed her plate for more creamed potato She felt
that she would die before she confessed to the ghastly absurdity of
that nightcap or to having been disturbed by the flight of peacocks
off a blue field of chintz after she had scoffed at the possibility of
such a thing She left the whole matter so vague that in a fashion she
came off the mistress of the situation She at all events impressed
everybody by her coolness in the face of no one knew what nightly
terror

After breakfast with the assistance of Amanda and Flora she moved
back into her old room Scarcely a word was spoken during the process
of moving but they all worked with trembling haste and looked guilty
when they met one anothers eyes as if conscious of betraying a common
fear

That afternoon the young minister John Dunn went to Sophia Gill and
requested permission to occupy the southwest chamber that night

I dont ask to have my effects moved there said he for I could
scarcely afford a room so much superior to the one I now occupy but I
would like if you please to sleep there tonight for the purpose of
refuting in my own person any unfortunate superstition which may have
obtained root here

Sophia Gill thanked the minister gratefully and eagerly accepted his
offer

How anybody with common sense can believe for a minute in any such
nonsense passes my comprehension said she

It certainly passes mine how anybody with Christian faith can believe
in ghosts said the minister gently and Sophia Gill felt a certain
feminine contentment in hearing him The minister was a child to her
she regarded him with no tincture of sentiment and yet she loved to
hear two other women covertly condemned by him and she herself thereby
exalted

That night about twelve oclock the Reverend John Dunn essayed to go to
his nightly slumber in the southwest chamber He had been sitting up
until that hour preparing his sermon

He traversed the hall with a little nightlamp in his hand opened the
door of the southwest chamber and essayed to enter He might as well
have essayed to enter the solid side of a house He could not believe
his senses The door was certainly open he could look into the room
full of soft lights and shadows under the moonlight which streamed into
the windows He could see the bed in which he had expected to pass the
night but he could not enter Whenever he strove to do so he had a
curious sensation as if he were trying to press against an invisible
person who met him with a force of opposition impossible to overcome
The minister was not an athletic man yet he had considerable strength
He squared his elbows set his mouth hard and strove to push his way
through into the room The opposition which he met was as sternly and
mutely terrible as the rocky fastness of a mountain in his way

For a half hour John Dunn doubting raging overwhelmed with spiritual
agony as to the state of his own soul rather than fear strove to enter
that southwest chamber He was simply powerless against this uncanny
obstacle Finally a great horror as of evil itself came over him He
was a nervous man and very young He fairly fled to his own chamber
and locked himself in like a terrorstricken girl

The next morning he went to Miss Gill and told her frankly what had
happened and begged her to say nothing about it lest he should have
injured the cause by the betrayal of such weakness for he actually had
come to believe that there was something wrong with the room

What it is I know not Miss Sophia said he but I firmly believe
against my will that there is in that room some accursed evil power at
work of which modern faith and modern science know nothing

Miss Sophia Gill listened with grimly lowering face She had an inborn
respect for the clergy but she was bound to hold that southwest
chamber in the dearly beloved old house of her fathers free of blame

I think I will sleep in that room myself tonight she said when the
minister had finished

He looked at her in doubt and dismay

I have great admiration for your faith and courage Miss Sophia he
said but are you wise

I am fully resolved to sleep in that room tonight said she
conclusively There were occasions when Miss Sophia Gill could put on
a manner of majesty and she did now

It was ten oclock that night when Sophia Gill entered the southwest
chamber She had told her sister what she intended doing and had been
proof against her tearful entreaties Amanda was charged not to tell
the young girl Flora

There is no use in frightening that child over nothing said Sophia

Sophia when she entered the southwest chamber set the lamp which she
carried on the bureau and began moving about the rooms pulling down
the curtains taking off the nice white counterpane of the bed and
preparing generally for the night

As she did so moving with great coolness and deliberation she became
conscious that she was thinking some thoughts that were foreign to her
She began remembering what she could not have remembered since she was
not then born the trouble over her mothers marriage the bitter
opposition the shutting the door upon her the ostracizing her from
heart and home She became aware of a most singular sensation as of
bitter resentment herself and not against the mother and sister who
had so treated her own mother but against her own mother and then she
became aware of a like bitterness extended to her own self She felt
malignant toward her mother as a young girl whom she remembered though
she could not have remembered and she felt malignant toward her own
self and her sister Amanda and Flora Evil suggestions surged in her
brainsuggestions which turned her heart to stone and which still
fascinated her And all the time by a sort of double consciousness she
knew that what she thought was strange and not due to her own volition
She knew that she was thinking the thoughts of some other person and
she knew who She felt herself possessed

But there was tremendous strength in the womans nature She had
inherited strength for good and righteous selfassertion from the evil
strength of her ancestors They had turned their own weapons against
themselves She made an effort which seemed almost mortal but was
conscious that the hideous thing was gone from her She thought her
own thoughts Then she scouted to herself the idea of anything
supernatural about the terrific experience I am imagining
everything she told herself She went on with her preparations she
went to the bureau to take down her hair She looked in the glass and
saw instead of her softly parted waves of hair harsh lines of
irongray under the black borders of an oldfashioned headdress She
saw instead of her smooth broad forehead a high one wrinkled with the
intensest concentration of selfish reflections of a long life she saw
instead of her steady blue eyes black ones with depths of malignant
reserve behind a broad meaning of ill will she saw instead of her
firm benevolent mouth one with a hard thin line a network of
melancholic wrinkles She saw instead of her own face middleaged and
good to see the expression of a life of honesty and good will to
others and patience under trials the face of a very old woman scowling
forever with unceasing hatred and misery at herself and all others at
life and death at that which had been and that which was to come
She saw instead of her own face in the glass the face of her dead Aunt
Harriet topping her own shoulders in her own wellknown dress

Sophia Gill left the room She went into the one which she shared with
her sister Amanda Amanda looked up and saw her standing there She
had set the lamp on a table and she stood holding a handkerchief over
her face Amanda looked at her with terror

What is it What is it Sophia she gasped

Sophia still stood with the handkerchief pressed to her face

Oh Sophia let me call somebody Is your face hurt Sophia what is
the matter with your face fairly shrieked Amanda

Suddenly Sophia took the handkerchief from her face

Look at me Amanda Gill she said in an awful voice

Amanda looked shrinking

What is it Oh what is it You dont look hurt What is it
Sophia

What do you see

Why I see you

Me

Yes you What did you think I would see

Sophia Gill looked at her sister Never as long as I live will I tell
you what I thought you would see and you must never ask me said she

Well I never will Sophia replied Amanda half weeping with terror

You wont try to sleep in that room again Sophia

No said Sophia and I am going to sell this house




THE VACANT LOT


When it became generally known in Townsend Centre that the Townsends
were going to move to the city there was great excitement and dismay
For the Townsends to move was about equivalent to the towns moving
The Townsend ancestors had founded the village a hundred years ago
The first Townsend had kept a wayside hostelry for man and beast known
as the Sign of the Leopard The signboard on which the leopard was
painted a bright blue was still extant and prominently so being
nailed over the present Townsends front door This Townsend by name
David kept the village store There had been no tavern since the
railroad was built through Townsend Centre in his fathers day
Therefore the family being ousted by the march of progress from their
chosen employment took up with a general country store as being the
next thing to a country tavern the principal difference consisting in
the fact that all the guests were transients never requiring
bedchambers securing their rest on the tops of sugar and flour barrels
and codfish boxes and their refreshment from stray nibblings at the
stock in trade to the profitless deplenishment of raisins and loaf
sugar and crackers and cheese

The flitting of the Townsends from the home of their ancestors was due
to a sudden access of wealth from the death of a relative and the
desire of Mrs Townsend to secure better advantages for her son George
sixteen years old in the way of education and for her daughter
Adrianna ten years older better matrimonial opportunities However
this last inducement for leaving Townsend Centre was not openly stated
only ingeniously surmised by the neighbours

Sarah Townsend dont think theres anybody in Townsend Centre fit for
her Adrianna to marry and so shes goin to take her to Boston to see
if she cant pick up somebody there they said Then they wondered
what Abel Lyons would do He had been a humble suitor for Adrianna for
years but her mother had not approved and Adrianna who was dutiful
had repulsed him delicately and rather sadly He was the only lover
whom she had ever had and she felt sorry and grateful she was a
plain awkward girl and had a patient recognition of the fact

But her mother was ambitious more so than her father who was rather
pugnaciously satisfied with what he had and not easily disposed to
change However he yielded to his wife and consented to sell out his
business and purchase a house in Boston and move there

David Townsend was curiously unlike the line of ancestors from whom he
had come He had either retrograded or advanced as one might look at
it His moral character was certainly better but he had not the fiery
spirit and eager grasp at advantage which had distinguished them
Indeed the old Townsends though prominent and respected as men of
property and influence had reputations not above suspicions There
was more than one dark whisper regarding them handed down from mother
to son in the village and especially was this true of the first
Townsend he who built the tavern bearing the Sign of the Blue Leopard
His portrait a hideous effort of contemporary art hung in the garret
of David Townsends home There was many a tale of wild roistering if
no worse in that old roadhouse and high stakes and quarreling in
cups and blows and money gotten in evil fashion and the matter
hushed up with a high hand for inquirers by the imperious Townsends who
terrorized everybody David Townsend terrorized nobody He had gotten
his little competence from his store by honest methodsthe exchanging
of sterling goods and true weights for country produce and country
shillings He was sober and reliable with intense selfrespect and a
decided talent for the management of money It was principally for
this reason that he took great delight in his sudden wealth by legacy
He had thereby greater opportunities for the exercise of his native
shrewdness in a bargain This he evinced in his purchase of a house in
Boston

One day in spring the old Townsend house was shut up the Blue Leopard
was taken carefully down from his lair over the front door the family
chattels were loaded on the train and the Townsends departed It was
a sad and eventful day for Townsend Centre A man from Barre had
rented the storeDavid had decided at the last not to selland the
old familiars congregated in melancholy fashion and talked over the
situation An enormous pride over their departed townsman became
evident They paraded him flaunting him like a banner in the eyes of
the new man David is awful smart they said there wont nobody
get the better of him in the city if he has lived in Townsend Centre
all his life Hes got his eyes open Know what he paid for his house
in Boston Well sir that house cost twentyfive thousand dollars and
David he bought it for five Yes sir he did

Must have been some out about it remarked the new man scowling over
his counter He was beginning to feel his disparaging situation

Not an out sir David he made sure ont Catch him gettin bit
Everythin was in applepie order hot an cold water and all and in
one of the best locations of the cityreal highup street David he
said the rent in that street was never under a thousand Yes sir
David he got a bargainfive thousand dollars for a
twentyfivethousanddollar house

Some out about it growled the new man over the counter

However as his fellow townsmen and allies stated there seemed to be
no doubt about the desirableness of the city house which David Townsend
had purchased and the fact that he had secured it for an absurdly low
price The whole family were at first suspicious It was ascertained
that the house had cost a round sum only a few years ago it was in
perfect repair nothing whatever was amiss with plumbing furnace
anything There was not even a soap factory within smelling distance
as Mrs Townsend had vaguely surmised She was sure that she had heard
of houses being undesirable for such reasons but there was no soap
factory They all sniffed and peeked when the first rainfall came
they looked at the ceiling confidently expecting to see dark spots
where the leaks had commenced but there were none They were forced
to confess that their suspicions were allayed that the house was
perfect even overshadowed with the mystery of a lower price than it
was worth That however was an additional perfection in the opinion
of the Townsends who had their share of New England thrift They had
lived just one month in their new house and were happy although at
times somewhat lonely from missing the society of Townsend Centre when
the trouble began The Townsends although they lived in a fine house
in a genteel almost fashionable part of the city were true to their
antecedents and kept as they had been accustomed only one maid She
was the daughter of a farmer on the outskirts of their native village
was middleaged and had lived with them for the last ten years One
pleasant Monday morning she rose early and did the family washing
before breakfast which had been prepared by Mrs Townsend and
Adrianna as was their habit on washingdays The family were seated
at the breakfast table in their basement diningroom and this maid
whose name was Cordelia was hanging out the clothes in the vacant lot
This vacant lot seemed a valuable one being on a corner It was
rather singular that it had not been built upon The Townsends had
wondered at it and agreed that they would have preferred their own
house to be there They had however utilized it as far as possible
with their innocent rural disregard of property rights in unoccupied
land

We might just as well hang out our washing in that vacant lot Mrs
Townsend had told Cordelia the first Monday of their stay in the house
Our little yard aint half big enough for all our clothes and it is
sunnier there too

So Cordelia had hung out the wash there for four Mondays and this was
the fifth The breakfast was about half finishedthey had reached the
buckwheat cakeswhen this maid came rushing into the diningroom and
stood regarding them speechless with a countenance indicative of the
utmost horror She was deadly pale Her hands sodden with soapsuds
hung twitching at her sides in the folds of her calico gown her very
hair which was light and sparse seemed to bristle with fear All the
Townsends turned and looked at her David and George rose with a
halfdefined idea of burglars

Cordelia Battles what is the matter cried Mrs Townsend Adrianna
gasped for breath and turned as white as the maid What is the
matter repeated Mrs Townsend but the maid was unable to speak
Mrs Townsend who could be peremptory sprang up ran to the
frightened woman and shook her violently Cordelia Battles you
speak said she and not stand there staring that way as if you were
struck dumb What is the matter with you

Then Cordelia spoke in a fainting voice

Theressomebody elsehanging out clothesin the vacant lot she
gasped and clutched at a chair for support

Who cried Mrs Townsend rousing to indignation for already she had
assumed a proprietorship in the vacant lot Is it the folks in the
next house Id like to know what right they have We are next to
that vacant lot

Idunnowho it is gasped Cordelia Why weve seen that girl
next door go to mass every morning said Mrs Townsend Shes got a
fiery red head Seems as if you might know her by this time Cordelia

It aint that girl gasped Cordelia Then she added in a
horrorstricken voice I couldnt see who twas

They all stared

Why couldnt you see demanded her mistress Are you struck blind

No maam

Then why couldnt you see

All I could see was Cordelia hesitated with an expression of the
utmost horror

Go on said Mrs Townsend impatiently

All I could see was the shadow of somebody very slim hanging out the
clothes and

What

I could see the shadows of the things flappin on their line

You couldnt see the clothes

Only the shadow on the ground

What kind of clothes were they

Queer replied Cordelia with a shudder

If I didnt know you so well I should think you had been drinking
said Mrs Townsend Now Cordelia Battles Im going out in that
vacant lot and see myself what youre talking about

I cant go gasped the woman

With that Mrs Townsend and all the others except Adrianna who
remained to tremble with the maid sallied forth into the vacant lot
They had to go out the area gate into the street to reach it It was
nothing unusual in the way of vacant lots One large poplar tree the
relic of the old forest which had once flourished there twinkled in
one corner for the rest it was overgrown with coarse weeds and a few
dusty flowers The Townsends stood just inside the rude board fence
which divided the lot from the street and stared with wonder and
horror for Cordelia had told the truth They all saw what she had
describedthe shadow of an exceedingly slim woman moving along the
ground with upstretched arms the shadows of strange nondescript
garments flapping from a shadowy line but when they looked up for the
substance of the shadows nothing was to be seen except the clear blue
October air

My goodness gasped Mrs Townsend Her face assumed a strange
gathering of wrath in the midst of her terror Suddenly she made a
determined move forward although her husband strove to hold her back

You let me be said she She moved forward Then she recoiled and
gave a loud shriek The wet sheet flapped in my face she cried
Take me away take me away Then she fainted Between them they got
her back to the house It was awful she moaned when she came to
herself with the family all around her where she lay on the
diningroom floor Oh David what do you suppose it is

Nothing at all replied David Townsend stoutly He was remarkable
for courage and staunch belief in actualities He was now denying to
himself that he had seen anything unusual

Oh there was moaned his wife

I saw something said George in a sullen boyish bass

The maid sobbed convulsively and so did Adrianna for sympathy

We wont talk any about it said David Here Jane you drink this
hot teait will do you good and Cordelia you hang out the clothes in
our own yard George you go and put up the line for her

The line is out there said George with a jerk of his shoulder

Are you afraid

No I aint replied the boy resentfully and went out with a pale
face

After that Cordelia hung the Townsend wash in the yard of their own
house standing always with her back to the vacant lot As for David
Townsend he spent a good deal of his time in the lot watching the
shadows but he came to no explanation although he strove to satisfy
himself with many

I guess the shadows come from the smoke from our chimneys or else the
poplar tree he said

Why do the shadows come on Monday mornings and no other demanded
his wife

David was silent

Very soon new mysteries arose One day Cordelia rang the dinnerbell
at their usual dinner hour the same as in Townsend Centre high noon
and the family assembled With amazement Adrianna looked at the dishes
on the table

Why thats queer she said

Whats queer asked her mother

Cordelia stopped short as she was about setting a tumbler of water
beside a plate and the water slopped over

Why said Adrianna her face paling Ithought there was boiled
dinner Ismelt cabbage cooking

I knew there would something else come up gasped Cordelia leaning
hard on the back of Adriannas chair

What do you mean asked Mrs Townsend sharply but her own face began
to assume the shocked pallour which it was so easy nowadays for all
their faces to assume at the merest suggestion of anything out of the
common

I smelt cabbage cooking all the morning up in my room Adrianna said
faintly and heres codfish and potatoes for dinner

The Townsends all looked at one another David rose with an
exclamation and rushed out of the room The others waited tremblingly
When he came back his face was lowering

What did you Mrs Townsend asked hesitatingly

Theres some smell of cabbage out there he admitted reluctantly
Then he looked at her with a challenge It comes from the next
house he said Blows over our house

Our house is higher

I dont care you can never account for such things

Cordelia said Mrs Townsend you go over to the next house and you
ask if theyve got cabbage for dinner

Cordelia switched out of the room her mouth set hard She came back
promptly

Says they never have cabbage she announced with gloomy triumph and a
conclusive glance at Mr Townsend Their girl was real sassy

Oh father lets move away lets sell the house cried Adrianna in
a panicstricken tone

If you think Im going to sell a house that I got as cheap as this one
because we smell cabbage in a vacant lot youre mistaken replied
David firmly

It isnt the cabbage alone said Mrs Townsend

And a few shadows added David I am tired of such nonsense I
thought you had more sense Jane

One of the boys at school asked me if we lived in the house next to
the vacant lot on Wells Street and whistled when I said Yes
remarked George

Let him whistle said Mr Townsend

After a few hours the family stimulated by Mr Townsends calm common
sense agreed that it was exceedingly foolish to be disturbed by a
mysterious odour of cabbage They even laughed at themselves

I suppose we have got so nervous over those shadows hanging out
clothes that we notice every little thing conceded Mrs Townsend

You will find out some day that that is no more to be regarded than
the cabbage said her husband

You cant account for that wet sheet hitting my face said Mrs
Townsend doubtfully

You imagined it

I FELT it

That afternoon things went on as usual in the household until nearly
four oclock Adrianna went downtown to do some shopping Mrs
Townsend sat sewing beside the bay window in her room which was a
front one in the third story George had not got home Mr Townsend
was writing a letter in the library Cordelia was busy in the
basement the twilight which was coming earlier and earlier every
night was beginning to gather when suddenly there was a loud crash
which shook the house from its foundations Even the dishes on the
sideboard rattled and the glasses rang like bells The pictures on the
walls of Mrs Townsends room swung out from the walls But that was
not all every lookingglass in the house cracked simultaneouslyas
nearly as they could judgefrom top to bottom then shivered into
fragments over the floors Mrs Townsend was too frightened to scream
She sat huddled in her chair gasping for breath her eyes rolling
from side to side in incredulous terror turned toward the street She
saw a great black group of people crossing it just in front of the
vacant lot There was something inexpressibly strange and gloomy about
this moving group there was an effect of sweeping wavings and
foldings of sable draperies and gleams of deadly white faces then they
passed She twisted her head to see and they disappeared in the
vacant lot Mr Townsend came hurrying into the room he was pale and
looked at once angry and alarmed

Did you fall he asked inconsequently as if his wife who was small
could have produced such a manifestation by a fall

Oh David what is it whispered Mrs Townsend

Darned if I know said David

Dont swear Its too awful Oh see the lookingglass David

I see it The one over the library mantel is broken too

Oh it is a sign of death

Cordelias feet were heard as she staggered on the stairs She almost
fell into the room She reeled over to Mr Townsend and clutched his
arm He cast a sidewise glance half furious half commiserating at
her

Well what is it all about he asked

I dont know What is it Oh what is it The lookingglass in the
kitchen is broken All over the floor Oh oh What is it

I dont know any more than you do I didnt do it

Lookinglasses broken is a sign of death in the house said
Cordelia If its me I hope Im ready but Id rather die than be so
scared as Ive been lately

Mr Townsend shook himself loose and eyed the two trembling women with
gathering resolution

Now look here both of you he said This is nonsense Youll die
sure enough of fright if you keep on this way I was a fool myself to
be startled Everything it is is an earthquake

Oh David gasped his wife not much reassured

It is nothing but an earthquake persisted Mr Townsend It acted
just like that Things always are broken on the walls and the middle
of the room isnt affected Ive read about it

Suddenly Mrs Townsend gave a loud shriek and pointed

How do you account for that she cried if its an earthquake Oh
oh oh

She was on the verge of hysterics Her husband held her firmly by the
arm as his eyes followed the direction of her rigid pointing finger
Cordelia looked also her eyes seeming converged to a bright point of
fear On the floor in front of the broken lookingglass lay a mass of
black stuff in a grewsome long ridge

Its something you dropped there almost shouted Mr Townsend

It aint Oh

Mr Townsend dropped his wifes arm and took one stride toward the
object It was a very long crape veil He lifted it and it floated
out from his arm as if imbued with electricity

Its yours he said to his wife

Oh David I never had one You know oh you know
Ishouldntunless you died How came it there

Im darned if I know said David regarding it He was deadly pale
but still resentful rather than afraid

Dont hold it dont

Id like to know what in thunder all this means said David He gave
the thing an angry toss and it fell on the floor in exactly the same
long heap as before

Cordelia began to weep with racking sobs Mrs Townsend reached out
and caught her husbands hand clutching it hard with icecold fingers

Whats got into this house anyhow he growled

Youll have to sell it Oh David we cant live here

As for my selling a house I paid only five thousand for when its
worth twentyfive for any such nonsense as this I wont

David gave one stride toward the black veil but it rose from the floor
and moved away before him across the room at exactly the same height as
if suspended from a womans head He pursued it clutching vainly all
around the room then he swung himself on his heel with an exclamation
and the thing fell to the floor again in the long heap Then were
heard hurrying feet on the stairs and Adrianna burst into the room
She ran straight to her father and clutched his arm she tried to
speak but she chattered unintelligibly her face was blue Her father
shook her violently

Adrianna do have more sense he cried

Oh David how can you talk so sobbed her mother

I cant help it Im mad said he with emphasis What has got into
this house and you all anyhow

What is it Adrianna poor child asked her mother Only look what
has happened here

Its an earthquake said her father staunchly nothing to be afraid
of

How do you account for THAT said Mrs Townsend in an awful voice
pointing to the veil

Adrianna did not lookshe was too engrossed with her own terrors She
began to speak in a breathless voice

Iwascomingby the vacant lot she panted andIIhad my new
hat in a paper bag anda parcel of blue ribbon andI saw a crowd an
awfuloh a whole crowd of people with white faces as ifthey were
dressed all in black

Where are they now

I dont know Oh Adrianna sank gasping feebly into a chair

Get her some water David sobbed her mother

David rushed with an impatient exclamation out of the room and returned
with a glass of water which he held to his daughters lips

Here drink this he said roughly

Oh David how can you speak so sobbed his wife

I cant help it Im mad clean through said David

Then there was a hard bound upstairs and George entered He was very
white but he grinned at them with an appearance of unconcern

Hullo he said in a shaking voice which he tried to control What
on earths to pay in that vacant lot now

Well what is it demanded his father

Oh nothing onlywell there are lights over it exactly as if there
was a house there just about where the windows would be It looked as
if you could walk right in but when you look close there are those old
driedup weeds rattling away on the ground the same as ever I looked
at it and couldnt believe my eyes A woman saw it too She came
along just as I did She gave one look then she screeched and ran I
waited for some one else but nobody came

Mr Townsend rushed out of the room

I daresay itll be gone when he gets there began George then he
stared round the room Whats to pay here he cried

Oh George the whole house shook all at once and all the
lookingglasses broke wailed his mother and Adrianna and Cordelia
joined

George whistled with pale lips Then Mr Townsend entered

Well asked George see anything

I dont want to talk said his father Ive stood just about
enough

Weve got to sell out and go back to Townsend Centre cried his wife
in a wild voice Oh David say youll go back

I wont go back for any such nonsense as this and sell a twentyfive
thousand dollar house for five thousand said he firmly

But that very night his resolution was shaken The whole family
watched together in the diningroom They were all afraid to go to
bedthat is all except possibly Mr Townsend Mrs Townsend declared
firmly that she for one would leave that awful house and go back to
Townsend Centre whether he came or not unless they all stayed together
and watched and Mr Townsend yielded They chose the diningroom for
the reason that it was nearer the street should they wish to make their
egress hurriedly and they took up their station around the
diningtable on which Cordelia had placed a luncheon

It looks exactly as if we were watching with a corpse she said in a
horrorstricken whisper

Hold your tongue if you cant talk sense said Mr Townsend

The diningroom was very large finished in oak with a dark blue paper
above the wainscotting The old sign of the tavern the Blue Leopard
hung over the mantelshelf Mr Townsend had insisted on hanging it
there He had a curious pride in it The family sat together until
after midnight and nothing unusual happened Mrs Townsend began to
nod Mr Townsend read the paper ostentatiously Adrianna and Cordelia
stared with roving eyes about the room then at each other as if
comparing notes on terror George had a book which he studied
furtively All at once Adrianna gave a startled exclamation and
Cordelia echoed her George whistled faintly Mrs Townsend awoke with
a start and Mr Townsends paper rattled to the floor

Look gasped Adrianna

The sign of the Blue Leopard over the shelf glowed as if a lantern hung
over it The radiance was thrown from above It grew brighter and
brighter as they watched The Blue Leopard seemed to crouch and spring
with life Then the door into the front hall openedthe outer door
which had been carefully locked It squeaked and they all recognized
it They sat staring Mr Townsend was as transfixed as the rest
They heard the outer door shut then the door into the room swung open
and slowly that awful black group of people which they had seen in the
afternoon entered The Townsends with one accord rose and huddled
together in a far corner they all held to each other and stared The
people their faces gleaming with a whiteness of death their black
robes waving and folding crossed the room They were a trifle above
mortal height or seemed so to the terrified eyes which saw them They
reached the mantelshelf where the signboard hung then a blackdraped
long arm was seen to rise and make a motion as if plying a knocker
Then the whole company passed out of sight as if through the wall and
the room was as before Mrs Townsend was shaking in a nervous chill
Adrianna was almost fainting Cordelia was in hysterics David
Townsend stood glaring in a curious way at the sign of the Blue
Leopard George stared at him with a look of horror There was
something in his fathers face which made him forget everything else
At last he touched his arm timidly

Father he whispered

David turned and regarded him with a look of rage and fury then his
face cleared he passed his hand over his forehead

Good Lord What DID come to me he muttered

You looked like that awful picture of old Tom Townsend in the garret
in Townsend Centre father whimpered the boy shuddering

Should think I might look like most any old cuss after such darned
work as this growled David but his face was white Go and pour out
some hot tea for your mother he ordered the boy sharply He himself
shook Cordelia violently Stop such actions he shouted in her ears
and shook her again Aint you a church member he demanded what
be you afraid of You aint done nothin wrong have ye

Then Cordelia quoted Scripture in a burst of sobs and laughter

Behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive
me she cried out If I aint done wrong mebbe them thats come
before me did and when the Evil One and the Powers of Darkness is
abroad Im liable Im liable Then she laughed loud and long and
shrill

If you dont hush up said David but still with that white terror
and horror on his own face Ill bundle you out in that vacant lot
whether or no I mean it

Then Cordelia was quiet after one wild roll of her eyes at him The
colour was returning to Adriannas cheeks her mother was drinking hot
tea in spasmodic gulps

Its after midnight she gasped and I dont believe theyll come
again tonight Do you David

No I dont said David conclusively

Oh David we mustnt stay another night in this awful house

We wont Tomorrow well pack off bag and baggage to Townsend
Centre if it takes all the fire department to move us said David

Adrianna smiled in the midst of her terror She thought of Abel Lyons

The next day Mr Townsend went to the real estate agent who had sold
him the house

Its no use he said I cant stand it Sell the house for what you
can get Ill give it away rather than keep it

Then he added a few strong words as to his opinion of parties who sold
him such an establishment But the agent pleaded innocent for the most
part

Ill own I suspected something wrong when the owner who pledged me to
secrecy as to his name told me to sell that place for what I could
get and did not limit me I had never heard anything but I began to
suspect something was wrong Then I made a few inquiries and found out
that there was a rumour in the neighbourhood that there was something
out of the usual about that vacant lot I had wondered myself why it
wasnt built upon There was a story about its being undertaken once
and the contract made and the contractor dying then another man took
it and one of the workmen was killed on his way to dig the cellar and
the others struck I didnt pay much attention to it I never
believed much in that sort of thing anyhow and then too I couldnt
find out that there had ever been anything wrong about the house
itself except as the people who had lived there were said to have seen
and heard queer things in the vacant lot so I thought you might be
able to get along especially as you didnt look like a man who was
timid and the house was such a bargain as I never handled before But
this you tell me is beyond belief

Do you know the names of the people who formerly owned the vacant
lot asked Mr Townsend

I dont know for certain replied the agent for the original owners
flourished long before your or my day but I do know that the lot goes
by the name of the old Gaston lot Whats the matter Are you ill

No it is nothing replied Mr Townsend Get what you can for the
house perhaps another family might not be as troubled as we have been

I hope you are not going to leave the city said the agent urbanely

I am going back to Townsend Centre as fast as steam can carry me after
we get packed up and out of that cursed house replied Mr David
Townsend

He did not tell the agent nor any of his family what had caused him to
start when told the name of the former owners of the lot He
remembered all at once the story of a ghastly murder which had taken
place in the Blue Leopard The victims name was Gaston and the
murderer had never been discovered




THE LOST GHOST


Mrs John Emerson sitting with her needlework beside the window
looked out and saw Mrs Rhoda Meserve coming down the street and knew
at once by the trend of her steps and the cant of her head that she
meditated turning in at her gate She also knew by a certain something
about her general carriagea thrusting forward of the neck a bustling
hitch of the shouldersthat she had important news Rhoda Meserve
always had the news as soon as the news was in being and generally
Mrs John Emerson was the first to whom she imparted it The two women
had been friends ever since Mrs Meserve had married Simon Meserve and
come to the village to live

Mrs Meserve was a pretty woman moving with graceful flirts of
ruffling skirts her clearcut nervous face as delicately tinted as a
shell looked brightly from the plumy brim of a black hat at Mrs
Emerson in the window Mrs Emerson was glad to see her coming She
returned the greeting with enthusiasm then rose hurriedly ran into
the cold parlour and brought out one of the best rockingchairs She
was just in time after drawing it up beside the opposite window to
greet her friend at the door

Goodafternoon said she I declare Im real glad to see you Ive
been alone all day John went to the city this morning I thought of
coming over to your house this afternoon but I couldnt bring my
sewing very well I am putting the ruffles on my new black dress
skirt

Well I didnt have a thing on hand except my crochet work responded
Mrs Meserve and I thought Id just run over a few minutes

Im real glad you did repeated Mrs Emerson Take your things
right off Here Ill put them on my bed in the bedroom Take the
rockingchair

Mrs Meserve settled herself in the parlour rockingchair while Mrs
Emerson carried her shawl and hat into the little adjoining bedroom
When she returned Mrs Meserve was rocking peacefully and was already
at work hooking blue wool in and out

Thats real pretty said Mrs Emerson

Yes I think its pretty replied Mrs Meserve

I suppose its for the church fair

Yes I dont suppose itll bring enough to pay for the worsted let
alone the work but I suppose Ive got to make something

How much did that one you made for the fair last year bring

Twentyfive cents

Its wicked aint it

I rather guess it is It takes me a week every minute I can get to
make one I wish those that bought such things for twentyfive cents
had to make them Guess theyd sing another song Well I suppose I
oughtnt to complain as long as it is for the Lord but sometimes it
does seem as if the Lord didnt get much out of it

Well its pretty work said Mrs Emerson sitting down at the
opposite window and taking up her dress skirt

Yes it is real pretty work I just LOVE to crochet

The two women rocked and sewed and crocheted in silence for two or
three minutes They were both waiting Mrs Meserve waited for the
others curiosity to develop in order that her news might have as it
were a befitting stage entrance Mrs Emerson waited for the news
Finally she could wait no longer

Well whats the news said she

Well I dont know as theres anything very particular hedged the
other woman prolonging the situation

Yes there is you cant cheat me replied Mrs Emerson

Now how do you know

By the way you look

Mrs Meserve laughed consciously and rather vainly

Well Simon says my face is so expressive I cant hide anything more
than five minutes no matter how hard I try said she Well there is
some news Simon came home with it this noon He heard it in South
Dayton He had some business over there this morning The old Sargent
place is let

Mrs Emerson dropped her sewing and stared

You dont say so

Yes it is

Who to

Why some folks from Boston that moved to South Dayton last year They
havent been satisfied with the house they had thereit wasnt large
enough The man has got considerable property and can afford to live
pretty well Hes got a wife and his unmarried sister in the family
The sisters got money too He does business in Boston and its just
as easy to get to Boston from here as from South Dayton and so theyre
coming here You know the old Sargent house is a splendid place

Yes its the handsomest house in town but

Oh Simon said they told him about that and he just laughed Said he
wasnt afraid and neither was his wife and sister Said hed risk
ghosts rather than little tuckedup sleepingrooms without any sun
like theyve had in the Dayton house Said hed rather risk SEEING
ghosts than risk being ghosts themselves Simon said they said he was
a great hand to joke

Oh well said Mrs Emerson it is a beautiful house and maybe
there isnt anything in those stories It never seemed to me they came
very straight anyway I never took much stock in them All I thought
wasif his wife was nervous

Nothing in creation would hire me to go into a house that Id ever
heard a word against of that kind declared Mrs Meserve with
emphasis I wouldnt go into that house if they would give me the
rent Ive seen enough of haunted houses to last me as long as I live

Mrs Emersons face acquired the expression of a hunting hound

Have you she asked in an intense whisper

Yes I have I dont want any more of it

Before you came here

Yes before I was marriedwhen I was quite a girl

Mrs Meserve had not married young Mrs Emerson had mental
calculations when she heard that

Did you really live in a house that was she whispered fearfully

Mrs Meserve nodded solemnly

Did you really everseeanything

Mrs Meserve nodded

You didnt see anything that did you any harm

No I didnt see anything that did me harm looking at it in one way
but it dont do anybody in this world any good to see things that
havent any business to be seen in it You never get over it

There was a moments silence Mrs Emersons features seemed to
sharpen

Well of course I dont want to urge you said she if you dont
feel like talking about it but maybe it might do you good to tell it
out if its on your mind worrying you

I try to put it out of my mind said Mrs Meserve

Well its just as you feel

I never told anybody but Simon said Mrs Meserve I never felt as
if it was wise perhaps I didnt know what folks might think So many
dont believe in anything they cant understand that they might think
my mind wasnt right Simon advised me not to talk about it He said
he didnt believe it was anything supernatural but he had to own up
that he couldnt give any explanation for it to save his life He had
to own up that he didnt believe anybody could Then he said he
wouldnt talk about it He said lots of folks would sooner tell folks
my head wasnt right than to own up they couldnt see through it

Im sure I wouldnt say so returned Mrs Emerson reproachfully You
know better than that I hope

Yes I do replied Mrs Meserve I know you wouldnt say so

And I wouldnt tell it to a soul if you didnt want me to

Well Id rather you wouldnt

I wont speak of it even to Mr Emerson

Id rather you wouldnt even to him

I wont

Mrs Emerson took up her dress skirt again Mrs Meserve hooked up
another loop of blue wool Then she begun

Of course said she I aint going to say positively that I believe
or disbelieve in ghosts but all I tell you is what I saw I cant
explain it I dont pretend I can for I cant If you can well and
good I shall be glad for it will stop tormenting me as it has done
and always will otherwise There hasnt been a day nor a night since
it happened that I havent thought of it and always I have felt the
shivers go down my back when I did

Thats an awful feeling Mrs Emerson said

Aint it Well it happened before I was married when I was a girl
and lived in East Wilmington It was the first year I lived there
You know my family all died five years before that I told you

Mrs Emerson nodded

Well I went there to teach school and I went to board with a Mrs
Amelia Dennison and her sister Mrs Bird Abby her name wasAbby
Bird She was a widow she had never had any children She had a
little moneyMrs Dennison didnt have anyand she had come to East
Wilmington and bought the house they lived in It was a real pretty
house though it was very old and run down It had cost Mrs Bird a
good deal to put it in order I guess that was the reason they took me
to board I guess they thought it would help along a little I guess
what I paid for my board about kept us all in victuals Mrs Bird had
enough to live on if they were careful but she had spent so much
fixing up the old house that they must have been a little pinched for
awhile

Anyhow they took me to board and I thought I was pretty lucky to get
in there I had a nice room big and sunny and furnished pretty the
paper and paint all new and everything as neat as wax Mrs Dennison
was one of the best cooks I ever saw and I had a little stove in my
room and there was always a nice fire there when I got home from
school I thought I hadnt been in such a nice place since I lost my
own home until I had been there about three weeks

I had been there about three weeks before I found it out though I
guess it had been going on ever since they had been in the house and
that was most four months They hadnt said anything about it and I
didnt wonder for there they had just bought the house and been to so
much expense and trouble fixing it up

Well I went there in September I begun my school the first Monday
I remember it was a real cold fall there was a frost the middle of
September and I had to put on my winter coat I remember when I came
home that night let me see I began school on a Monday and that was
two weeks from the next Thursday I took off my coat downstairs and
laid it on the table in the front entry It was a real nice coatheavy
black broadcloth trimmed with fur I had had it the winter before
Mrs Bird called after me as I went upstairs that I ought not to leave
it in the front entry for fear somebody might come in and take it but
I only laughed and called back to her that I wasnt afraid I never
was much afraid of burglars

Well though it was hardly the middle of September it was a real cold
night I remember my room faced west and the sun was getting low and
the sky was a pale yellow and purple just as you see it sometimes in
the winter when there is going to be a cold snap I rather think that
was the night the frost came the first time I know Mrs Dennison
covered up some flowers she had in the front yard anyhow I remember
looking out and seeing an old green plaid shawl of hers over the
verbena bed There was a fire in my little woodstove Mrs Bird made
it I know She was a real motherly sort of woman she always seemed
to be the happiest when she was doing something to make other folks
happy and comfortable Mrs Dennison told me she had always been so
She said she had coddled her husband within an inch of his life Its
lucky Abby never had any children she said for she would have
spoilt them

Well that night I sat down beside my nice little fire and ate an
apple There was a plate of nice apples on my table Mrs Bird put
them there I was always very fond of apples Well I sat down and
ate an apple and was having a beautiful time and thinking how lucky I
was to have got board in such a place with such nice folks when I
heard a queer little sound at my door It was such a little hesitating
sort of sound that it sounded more like a fumble than a knock as if
some one very timid with very little hands was feeling along the
door not quite daring to knock For a minute I thought it was a
mouse But I waited and it came again and then I made up my mind it
was a knock but a very little scared one so I said Come in

But nobody came in and then presently I heard the knock again Then I
got up and opened the door thinking it was very queer and I had a
frightened feeling without knowing why

Well I opened the door and the first thing I noticed was a draught
of cold air as if the front door downstairs was open but there was a
strange close smell about the cold draught It smelled more like a
cellar that had been shut up for years than outofdoors Then I saw
something I saw my coat first The thing that held it was so small
that I couldnt see much of anything else Then I saw a little white
face with eyes so scared and wishful that they seemed as if they might
eat a hole in anybodys heart It was a dreadful little face with
something about it which made it different from any other face on
earth but it was so pitiful that somehow it did away a good deal with
the dreadfulness And there were two little hands spotted purple with
the cold holding up my winter coat and a strange little faraway
voice said I cant find my mother

For Heavens sake I said who are you

Then the little voice said again I cant find my mother

All the time I could smell the cold and I saw that it was about the
child that cold was clinging to her as if she had come out of some
deadly cold place Well I took my coat I did not know what else to
do and the cold was clinging to that It was as cold as if it had
come off ice When I had the coat I could see the child more plainly
She was dressed in one little white garment made very simply It was a
nightgown only very long quite covering her feet and I could see
dimly through it her little thin body mottled purple with the cold
Her face did not look so cold that was a clear waxen white Her hair
was dark but it looked as if it might be dark only because it was so
damp almost wet and might really be light hair It clung very close
to her forehead which was round and white She would have been very
beautiful if she had not been so dreadful

Who are you says I again looking at her

She looked at me with her terrible pleading eyes and did not say
anything

What are you says I Then she went away She did not seem to run
or walk like other children She flitted like one of those little
filmy white butterflies that dont seem like real ones they are so
light and move as if they had no weight But she looked back from the
head of the stairs I cant find my mother said she and I never
heard such a voice

Who is your mother says I but she was gone

Well I thought for a moment I should faint away The room got dark
and I heard a singing in my ears Then I flung my coat onto the bed
My hands were as cold as ice from holding it and I stood in my door
and called first Mrs Bird and then Mrs Dennison I didnt dare go
down over the stairs where that had gone It seemed to me I should go
mad if I didnt see somebody or something like other folks on the face
of the earth I thought I should never make anybody hear but I could
hear them stepping about downstairs and I could smell biscuits baking
for supper Somehow the smell of those biscuits seemed the only
natural thing left to keep me in my right mind I didnt dare go over
those stairs I just stood there and called and finally I heard the
entry door open and Mrs Bird called back

What is it Did you call Miss Arms

Come up here come up here as quick as you can both of you I
screamed out quick quick quick

I heard Mrs Bird tell Mrs Dennison Come quick Amelia something
is the matter in Miss Arms room It struck me even then that she
expressed herself rather queerly and it struck me as very queer
indeed when they both got upstairs and I saw that they knew what had
happened or that they knew of what nature the happening was

What is it dear asked Mrs Bird and her pretty loving voice had
a strained sound I saw her look at Mrs Dennison and I saw Mrs
Dennison look back at her

For Gods sake says I and I never spoke so beforefor Gods
sake what was it brought my coat upstairs

What was it like asked Mrs Dennison in a sort of failing voice
and she looked at her sister again and her sister looked back at her

It was a child I have never seen here before It looked like a
child says I but I never saw a child so dreadful and it had on a
nightgown and said she couldnt find her mother Who was it What was
it

I thought for a minute Mrs Dennison was going to faint but Mrs Bird
hung onto her and rubbed her hands and whispered in her ear she had
the cooingest kind of voice and I ran and got her a glass of cold
water I tell you it took considerable courage to go downstairs alone
but they had set a lamp on the entry table so I could see I dont
believe I could have spunked up enough to have gone downstairs in the
dark thinking every second that child might be close to me The lamp
and the smell of the biscuits baking seemed to sort of keep my courage
up but I tell you I didnt waste much time going down those stairs and
out into the kitchen for a glass of water I pumped as if the house
was afire and I grabbed the first thing I came across in the shape of
a tumbler it was a painted one that Mrs Dennisons Sunday school
class gave her and it was meant for a flower vase

Well I filled it and then ran upstairs I felt every minute as if
something would catch my feet and I held the glass to Mrs Dennisons
lips while Mrs Bird held her head up and she took a good long
swallow then she looked hard at the tumbler

Yes says I I know I got this one but I took the first I came
across and it isnt hurt a mite

Dont get the painted flowers wet says Mrs Dennison very feebly
theyll wash off if you do

Ill be real careful says I I knew she set a sight by that
painted tumbler

The water seemed to do Mrs Dennison good for presently she pushed
Mrs Bird away and sat up She had been laying down on my bed

Im all over it now says she but she was terribly white and her
eyes looked as if they saw something outside things Mrs Bird wasnt
much better but she always had a sort of settled sweet good look that
nothing could disturb to any great extent I knew I looked dreadful
for I caught a glimpse of myself in the glass and I would hardly have
known who it was

Mrs Dennison she slid off the bed and walked sort of tottery to a
chair I was silly to give way so says she

No you wasnt silly sister says Mrs Bird I dont know what
this means any more than you do but whatever it is no one ought to be
called silly for being overcome by anything so different from other
things which we have known all our lives

Mrs Dennison looked at her sister then she looked at me then back
at her sister again and Mrs Bird spoke as if she had been asked a
question

Yes says she I do think Miss Arms ought to be toldthat is I
think she ought to be told all we know ourselves

That isnt much said Mrs Dennison with a dyingaway sort of sigh
She looked as if she might faint away again any minute She was a real
delicatelooking woman but it turned out she was a good deal stronger
than poor Mrs Bird

No there isnt much we do know says Mrs Bird but what little
there is she ought to know I felt as if she ought to when she first
came here

Well I didnt feel quite right about it said Mrs Dennison but I
kept hoping it might stop and any way that it might never trouble
her and you had put so much in the house and we needed the money and
I didnt know but she might be nervous and think she couldnt come and
I didnt want to take a man boarder

And aside from the money we were very anxious to have you come my
dear says Mrs Bird

Yes says Mrs Dennison we wanted the young company in the house
we were lonesome and we both of us took a great liking to you the
minute we set eyes on you

And I guess they meant what they said both of them They were
beautiful women and nobody could be any kinder to me than they were
and I never blamed them for not telling me before and as they said
there wasnt really much to tell

They hadnt any sooner fairly bought the house and moved into it
than they began to see and hear things Mrs Bird said they were
sitting together in the sittingroom one evening when they heard it the
first time She said her sister was knitting lace Mrs Dennison made
beautiful knitted lace and she was reading the Missionary Herald Mrs
Bird was very much interested in mission work when all of a sudden
they heard something She heard it first and she laid down her
Missionary Herald and listened and then Mrs Dennison she saw her
listening and she drops her lace What is it you are listening to
Abby says she Then it came again and they both heard and the cold
shivers went down their backs to hear it though they didnt know why
Its the cat isnt it says Mrs Bird

It isnt any cat says Mrs Dennison

Oh I guess it MUST be the cat maybe shes got a mouse says Mrs
Bird real cheerful to calm down Mrs Dennison for she saw she was
most scared to death and she was always afraid of her fainting away
Then she opens the door and calls Kitty kitty kitty They had
brought their cat with them in a basket when they came to East
Wilmington to live It was a real handsome tiger cat a tommy and he
knew a lot

Well she called Kitty kitty kitty and sure enough the kitty
came and when he came in the door he gave a big yawl that didnt sound
unlike what they had heard

There sister here he is you see it was the cat says Mrs Bird
Poor kitty

But Mrs Dennison she eyed the cat and she give a great screech

Whats that Whats that says she

Whats what says Mrs Bird pretending to herself that she didnt
see what her sister meant

Somethins got hold of that cats tail says Mrs Dennison
Somethins got hold of his tail Its pulled straight out an he
cant get away Just hear him yawl

It isnt anything says Mrs Bird but even as she said that she
could see a little hand holding fast to that cats tail and then the
child seemed to sort of clear out of the dimness behind the hand and
the child was sort of laughing then instead of looking sad and she
said that was a great deal worse She said that laugh was the most
awful and the saddest thing she ever heard

Well she was so dumfounded that she didnt know what to do and she
couldnt sense at first that it was anything supernatural She thought
it must be one of the neighbours children who had run away and was
making free of their house and was teasing their cat and that they
must be just nervous to feel so upset by it So she speaks up sort of
sharp

Dont you know that you mustnt pull the kittys tail says she
Dont you know you hurt the poor kitty and shell scratch you if you
dont take care Poor kitty you mustnt hurt her

And with that she said the child stopped pulling that cats tail and
went to stroking her just as soft and pitiful and the cat put his back
up and rubbed and purred as if he liked it The cat never seemed a
mite afraid and that seemed queer for I had always heard that animals
were dreadfully afraid of ghosts but then that was a pretty harmless
little sort of ghost

Well Mrs Bird said the child stroked that cat while she and Mrs
Dennison stood watching it and holding onto each other for no matter
how hard they tried to think it was all right it didnt look right
Finally Mrs Dennison she spoke

Whats your name little girl says she

Then the child looks up and stops stroking the cat and says she cant
find her mother just the way she said it to me Then Mrs Dennison
she gave such a gasp that Mrs Bird thought she was going to faint
away but she didnt Well who is your mother says she But the
child just says again I cant find my motherI cant find my mother

Where do you live dear says Mrs Bird

I cant find my mother says the child

Well that was the way it was Nothing happened Those two women
stood there hanging onto each other and the child stood in front of
them and they asked her questions and everything she would say was
I cant find my mother

Then Mrs Bird tried to catch hold of the child for she thought in
spite of what she saw that perhaps she was nervous and it was a real
child only perhaps not quite right in its head that had run away in
her little nightgown after she had been put to bed

She tried to catch the child She had an idea of putting a shawl
around it and going outshe was such a little thing she could have
carried her easy enoughand trying to find out to which of the
neighbours she belonged But the minute she moved toward the child
there wasnt any child there there was only that little voice seeming
to come from nothing saying I cant find my mother and presently
that died away

Well that same thing kept happening or something very much the same
Once in awhile Mrs Bird would be washing dishes and all at once the
child would be standing beside her with the dishtowel wiping them
Of course that was terrible Mrs Bird would wash the dishes all
over Sometimes she didnt tell Mrs Dennison it made her so nervous
Sometimes when they were making cake they would find the raisins all
picked over and sometimes little sticks of kindlingwood would be
found laying beside the kitchen stove They never knew when they would
come across that child and always she kept saying over and over that
she couldnt find her mother They never tried talking to her except
once in awhile Mrs Bird would get desperate and ask her something but
the child never seemed to hear it she always kept right on saying that
she couldnt find her mother

After they had told me all they had to tell about their experience
with the child they told me about the house and the people that had
lived there before they did It seemed something dreadful had happened
in that house And the land agent had never let on to them I dont
think they would have bought it if he had no matter how cheap it was
for even if folks arent really afraid of anything they dont want to
live in houses where such dreadful things have happened that you keep
thinking about them I know after they told me I should never have
stayed there another night if I hadnt thought so much of them no
matter how comfortable I was made and I never was nervous either
But I stayed Of course it didnt happen in my room If it had I
could not have stayed

What was it asked Mrs Emerson in an awed voice

It was an awful thing That child had lived in the house with her
father and mother two years before They had comeor the father
hadfrom a real good family He had a good situation he was a
drummer for a big leather house in the city and they lived real
pretty with plenty to do with But the mother was a real wicked
woman She was as handsome as a picture and they said she came from
good sort of people enough in Boston but she was bad clean through
though she was real pretty spoken and most everybody liked her She
used to dress out and make a great show and she never seemed to take
much interest in the child and folks began to say she wasnt treated
right

The woman had a hard time keeping a girl For some reason one
wouldnt stay They would leave and then talk about her awfully
telling all kinds of things People didnt believe it at first then
they began to They said that the woman made that little thing though
she wasnt much over five years old and small and babyish for her age
do most of the work what there was done they said the house used to
look like a pigsty when she didnt have help They said the little
thing used to stand on a chair and wash dishes and theyd seen her
carrying in sticks of wood most as big as she was many a time and
theyd heard her mother scolding her The woman was a fine singer and
had a voice like a screechowl when she scolded

The father was away most of the time and when that happened he had
been away out West for some weeks There had been a married man
hanging about the mother for some time and folks had talked some but
they werent sure there was anything wrong and he was a man very high
up with money so they kept pretty still for fear he would hear of it
and make trouble for them and of course nobody was sure though folks
did say afterward that the father of the child had ought to have been
told

But that was very easy to say it wouldnt have been so easy to find
anybody who would have been willing to tell him such a thing as that
especially when they werent any too sure He set his eyes by his
wife too They said all he seemed to think of was to earn money to
buy things to deck her out in And he about worshiped the child too
They said he was a real nice man The men that are treated so bad
mostly are real nice men Ive always noticed that

Well one morning that man that there had been whispers about was
missing He had been gone quite a while though before they really
knew that he was missing because he had gone away and told his wife
that he had to go to New York on business and might be gone a week and
not to worry if he didnt get home and not to worry if he didnt
write because he should be thinking from day to day that he might take
the next train home and there would be no use in writing So the wife
waited and she tried not to worry until it was two days over the week
then she run into a neighbours and fainted dead away on the floor and
then they made inquiries and found out that he had skippedwith some
money that didnt belong to him too

Then folks began to ask where was that woman and they found out by
comparing notes that nobody had seen her since the man went away but
three or four women remembered that she had told them that she thought
of taking the child and going to Boston to visit her folks so when
they hadnt seen her around and the house shut they jumped to the
conclusion that was where she was They were the neighbours that lived
right around her but they didnt have much to do with her and shed
gone out of her way to tell them about her Boston plan and they didnt
make much reply when she did

Well there was this house shut up and the man and woman missing and
the child Then all of a sudden one of the women that lived the
nearest remembered something She remembered that she had waked up
three nights running thinking she heard a child crying somewhere and
once she waked up her husband but he said it must be the Bisbees
little girl and she thought it must be The child wasnt well and was
always crying It used to have colic spells especially at night So
she didnt think any more about it until this came up then all of a
sudden she did think of it She told what she had heard and finally
folks began to think they had better enter that house and see if there
was anything wrong

Well they did enter it and they found that child dead locked in one
of the rooms Mrs Dennison and Mrs Bird never used that room it
was a back bedroom on the second floor

Yes they found that poor child there starved to death and frozen
though they werent sure she had frozen to death for she was in bed
with clothes enough to keep her pretty warm when she was alive But
she had been there a week and she was nothing but skin and bone It
looked as if the mother had locked her into the house when she went
away and told her not to make any noise for fear the neighbours would
hear her and find out that she herself had gone

Mrs Dennison said she couldnt really believe that the woman had
meant to have her own child starved to death Probably she thought the
little thing would raise somebody or folks would try to get in the
house and find her Well whatever she thought there the child was
dead

But that wasnt all The father came home right in the midst of it
the child was just buried and he was beside himself Andhe went on
the track of his wife and he found her and he shot her dead it was
in all the papers at the time then he disappeared Nothing had been
seen of him since Mrs Dennison said that she thought he had either
made way with himself or got out of the country nobody knew but they
did know there was something wrong with the house

I knew folks acted queer when they asked me how I liked it when we
first came here says Mrs Dennison but I never dreamed why till we
saw the child that night

I never heard anything like it in my life said Mrs Emerson staring
at the other woman with awestruck eyes

I thought youd say so said Mrs Meserve You dont wonder that I
aint disposed to speak light when I hear there is anything queer about
a house do you

No I dont after that Mrs Emerson said

But that aint all said Mrs Meserve

Did you see it again Mrs Emerson asked

Yes I saw it a number of times before the last time It was lucky I
wasnt nervous or I never could have stayed there much as I liked the
place and much as I thought of those two women they were beautiful
women and no mistake I loved those women I hope Mrs Dennison will
come and see me sometime

Well I stayed and I never knew when Id see that child I got so I
was very careful to bring everything of mine upstairs and not leave
any little thing in my room that needed doing for fear she would come
lugging up my coat or hat or gloves or Id find things done when
thered been no live being in the room to do them I cant tell you
how I dreaded seeing her and worse than the seeing her was the hearing
her say I cant find my mother It was enough to make your blood
run cold I never heard a living child cry for its mother that was
anything so pitiful as that dead one It was enough to break your heart

She used to come and say that to Mrs Bird oftener than to any one
else Once I heard Mrs Bird say she wondered if it was possible that
the poor little thing couldnt really find her mother in the other
world she had been such a wicked woman

But Mrs Dennison told her she didnt think she ought to speak so nor
even think so and Mrs Bird said she shouldnt wonder if she was
right Mrs Bird was always very easy to put in the wrong She was a
good woman and one that couldnt do things enough for other folks It
seemed as if that was what she lived on I dont think she was ever so
scared by that poor little ghost as much as she pitied it and she was
most heartbroken because she couldnt do anything for it as she could
have done for a live child

It seems to me sometimes as if I should die if I cant get that awful
little white robe off that child and get her in some clothes and feed
her and stop her looking for her mother I heard her say once and she
was in earnest She cried when she said it That wasnt long before
she died

Now I am coming to the strangest part of it all Mrs Bird died very
sudden One morningit was Saturday and there wasnt any schoolI
went downstairs to breakfast and Mrs Bird wasnt there there was
nobody but Mrs Dennison She was pouring out the coffee when I came
in Why wheres Mrs Bird says I

Abby aint feeling very well this morning says she there isnt
much the matter I guess but she didnt sleep very well and her head
aches and shes sort of chilly and I told her I thought shed better
stay in bed till the house gets warm It was a very cold morning

Maybe shes got cold says I

Yes I guess she has says Mrs Dennison I guess shes got cold
Shell be up before long Abby aint one to stay in bed a minute
longer than she can help

Well we went on eating our breakfast and all at once a shadow
flickered across one wall of the room and over the ceiling the way a
shadow will sometimes when somebody passes the window outside Mrs
Dennison and I both looked up then out of the window then Mrs
Dennison she gives a scream

Why Abbys crazy says she There she is out this bitter cold
morning andand She didnt finish but she meant the child For
we were both looking out and we saw as plain as we ever saw anything
in our lives Mrs Abby Bird walking off over the white snowpath with
that child holding fast to her hand nestling close to her as if she
had found her own mother

Shes dead says Mrs Dennison clutching hold of me hard Shes
dead my sister is dead

She was We hurried upstairs as fast as we could go and she was dead
in her bed and smiling as if she was dreaming and one arm and hand
was stretched out as if something had hold of it and it couldnt be
straightened even at the lastit lay out over her casket at the
funeral

Was the child ever seen again asked Mrs Emerson in a shaking voice

No replied Mrs Meserve that child was never seen again after she
went out of the yard with Mrs Bird
