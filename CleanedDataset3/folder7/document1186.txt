DEDICATION


TO W M

_Most of these verses were written in the authors early youth and were
published in a volume called Preludes now out of print Other poems
representing the same transitory and early thoughts which appeared in
that volume are now omitted as cruder than the rest and their place is
taken by the few verses written in maturer years_




SONNETMY HEART SHALL BE THY GARDEN


My heart shall be thy garden Come my own
 Into thy garden thine be happy hours
 Among my fairest thoughts my tallest flowers
From root to crowning petal thine alone

Thine is the place from where the seeds are sown
 Up to the sky enclosed with all its showers
 But ah the birds the birds Who shall build bowers
To keep these thine O friend the birds have flown

For as these come and go and quit our pine
 To follow the sweet season or newcomers
 Sing one song only from our aldertrees

My heart has thoughts which though thine eyes hold mine
 Flit to the silent world and other summers
 With wings that dip beyond the silver seas




SONNETTHOUGHTS IN SEPARATION


We never meet yet we meet day by day
 Upon those hills of life dim and immense
 The good we love and sleepour innocence
O hills of life high hills And higher than they

Our guardian spirits meet at prayer and play
 Beyond pain joy and hope and long suspense
 Above the summits of our souls far hence
An angel meets an angel on the way

Beyond all good I ever believed of thee
 Or thou of me these always love and live
And though I fail of thy ideal of me

My angel falls not short They greet each other
 Who knows they may exchange the kiss we give
Thou to thy crucifix I to my mother




TO A POET


Thou who singest through the earth
 All the earths wild creatures fly thee
Everywhere thou marrest mirth
 Dumbly they defy thee
There is something they deny thee

Pines thy fallen nature ever
For the unfallen Nature sweet
But she shuns thy long endeavour
 Though her flowers and wheat
Throng and press thy pausing feet

Though thou tame a bird to love thee
Press thy face to grass and flowers
All these things reserve above thee
 Secrets in the bowers
Secrets in the sun and showers

Sing thy sorrow sing thy gladness
In thy songs must wind and tree
Bear the fictions of thy sadness
 Thy humanity
For their truth is not for thee

Wait and many a secret nest
Many a hoarded winterstore
Will be hidden on thy breast
 Things thou longest for
Will not fear or shun thee more

Thou shalt intimately lie
In the roots of flowers that thrust
Upwards from thee to the sky
 With no more distrust
When they blossom from thy dust

Silent labours of the rain
Shall be near thee reconciled
Little lives of leaves and grain
 All things shy and wild
Tell thee secrets quiet child

Earth set free from thy fair fancies
And the art thou shalt resign
Will bring forth her rue and pansies
 Unto more divine
Thoughts than any thoughts of thine

Nought will fear thee humbled creature
There will lie thy mortal burden
Pressed unto the heart of Nature
 Songless in a garden
With a long embrace of pardon

Then the truth all creatures tell
And His will whom thou entreatest
Shall absorb thee there shall dwell
 Silence the completest
Of thy poems last and sweetest




SONG OF THE SPRING TO THE SUMMER


THE POET SINGS TO HER POET

O poet of the time to be
 My conqueror I began for thee
Enter into thy poets pain
 And take the riches of the rain
And make the perfect year for me

Thou unto whom my lyre shall fall
Wheneer thou comest hear my call
 O keep the promise of my lays
 Take the sweet parable of my days
I trust thee with the aim of all

And if thy thoughts unfold from me
Know that I too have hints of thee
 Dim hopes that come across my mind
 In the rare days of warmer wind
And tones of summer in the sea

And I have set thy paths I guide
Thy blossoms on the wild hillside
 And I thy bygone poet share
 The flowers that throng thy feet where
I led thy feet before I died




TO THE BELOVED


Oh not more subtly silence strays
 Amongst the winds between the voices
Mingling alike with pensive lays
 And with the music that rejoices
Than thou art present in my days

My silence life returns to thee
 In all the pauses of her breath
Hush back to rest the melody
 That out of thee awakeneth
And thou wake ever wake for me

Full full is life in hidden places
 For thou art silence unto me
Full full is thought in endless spaces
 Full is my life A silent sea
Lies round all shores with long embraces

Thou art like silence all unvexed
 Though wild words part my soul from thee
Thou art like silence unperplexed
 A secret and a mystery
Between one footfall and the next

Most dear pause in a mellow lay
 Thou art inwoven with every air
With thee the wildest tempests play
 And snatches of thee everywhere
Make little heavens throughout a day

Darkness and solitude shine for me
 For lifes fair outward part are rife
The silver noises let them be
 It is the very soul of life
Listens for thee listens for thee

O pause between the sobs of cares
 O thought within all thought that is
Trance between laughters unawares
 Thou art the form of melodies
And thou the ecstasy of prayers




MEDITATION


_Rorate Coeli desuper et nubes pluant Justum_
_Aperiatur Terra et germinet Salvatorem_

No sudden thing of glory and fear
 Was the Lords coming but the dear
Slow Natures days followed each other
To form the Saviour from his Mother
One of the children of the year

The earth the rain received the trust
The sun and dews to frame the Just
 He drew his daily life from these
 According to his own decrees
Who makes man from the fertile dust

Sweet summer and the winter wild
These brought him forth the Undefiled
 The happy Springs renewed again
 His daily bread the growing grain
The food and raiment of the Child




TO THE BELOVED DEADA LAMENT


Beloved thou art like a tune that idle fingers
 Play on a windowpane
The time is there the form of music lingers
 But O thou sweetest strain
Where is thy soul Thou liest i the wind and rain

Even as to him who plays that idle air
 It seems a melody
For his own soul is full of it so my Fair
 Dead thou dost live in me
And all this lonely soul is full of thee

Thou song of songsnot music as before
 Unto the outward ear
My spirit sings thee inly evermore
 Thy falls with tear on tear
I fail for thee thou art too sweet too dear

Thou silent song thou ever voiceless rhyme
 Is there no pulse to move thee
At windy dawn with a wild heart beating time
 And falling tears above thee
O music stifled from the ears that love thee

Oh for a strain of thee from outer air
 Soul wearies soul I find
Of thee thee thee I am mournfully aware
 Contained in one poor mind
Who wert in tune and time to every wind

Poor grave poor lost beloved but I burn
 For some more vast To be
As he that played that secret tune may turn
 And strike it on a lyre triumphantly
I wait some future all a lyre for thee




SONNET


Your own fair youth you care so little for it
 Smiling towards Heaven you would not stay the advances
 Of time and change upon your happiest fancies
I keep your golden hour and will restore it

If ever in time to come you would explore it
 Your old self whose thoughts went like last years pansies
 Look unto me no mirror keeps its glances
In my unfailing praises now I store it

To keep all joys of yours from Times estranging
 I shall be then a treasury where your gay
 Happy and pensive past for ever is

I shall be then a garden charmed from changing
 In which your June has never passed away
 Walk there awhile among my memories




IN AUTUMN


The leaves are many under my feet
 And drift one way
Their scent of death is weary and sweet
 A flight of them is in the grey
Where sky and forest meet

The low winds moan for dead sweet years
 The birds sing all for pain
Of a common thing to weary ears
 Only a summers fate of rain
And a womans fate of tears

I walk to love and life alone
 Over these mournful places
Across the summer overthrown
 The dead joys of these silent faces
To claim my own

I know his heart has beat to bright
 Sweet loves gone by
I know the leaves that die tonight
 Once budded to the sky
And I shall die from his delight

O leaves so quietly ending now
 You have heard cuckoos sing
And I will grow upon my bough
 If only for a Spring
And fall when the rain is on my brow

O tell me tell me ere you die
 Is it worth the pain
You bloomed so fair you waved so high
 Now that the sad days wane
Are you repenting where you lie

I lie amongst you and I kiss
 Your fragrance mouldering
O dead delights is it such bliss
 That tuneful Spring
Is love so sweet that comes to this

O dying blisses of the year
 I hear the young lambs bleat
The clamouring birds i the copse I hear
 I hear the waving wheat
Together laid on a deadleaf bier

Kiss me again as I kiss you
 Kiss me again
For all your tuneful nights of dew
 In this your time of rain
For all your kisses when Spring was new

You will not broken hearts let be
 I pass across your death
To a golden summer you shall not see
 And in your dying breath
There is no benison for me

There is an autumn yet to wane
 There are leaves yet to fall
Which when I kiss may kiss again
 And pitied pity me all for all
And love me in mist and rain




A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE


Listen and when thy hand this paper presses
O timeworn woman think of her who blesses
What thy thin fingers touch with her caresses

O mother for the weight of years that break thee
O daughter for slow time must yet awake thee
And from the changes of my heart must make thee

O fainting traveller morn is grey in heaven
Dost thou remember how the clouds were driven
And are they calm about the fall of even

Pause near the ending of thy long migration
For this one sudden hour of desolation
Appeals to one hour of thy meditation

Suffer O silent one that I remind thee
Of the great hills that stormed the sky behind thee
Of the wild winds of power that have resigned thee

Know that the mournful plain where thou must wander
Is but a grey and silent world but ponder
The misty mountains of the morning yonder

Listen the mountain winds with rain were fretting
And sudden gleams the mountaintops besetting
I cannot let thee fade to death forgetting

What part of this wild heart of mine I know not
Will follow with thee where the great winds blow not
And where the young flowers of the mountain grow not

Yet let my letter with thy lost thoughts in it
Tell what the way was when thou didst begin it
And win with thee the goal when thou shalt win it

Oh in some hour of thine my thoughts shall guide thee
Suddenly though time darkness silence hide thee
This wind from thy lost country flits beside thee

Telling thee all thy memories moved the maiden
With thy regrets was morning overshaden
With sorrow thou hast left her life was laden

But whither shall my thoughts turn to pursue thee
Life changes and the years and days renew thee
Oh Nature brings my straying heart unto thee

Her winds will join us with their constant kisses
Upon the evening as the morning tresses
Her summers breathe the same unchanging blisses

And we so altered in our shifting phases
Track one another mid the many mazes
By the eternal childbreath of the daisies

I have not writ this letter of divining
To make a glory of thy silent pining
A triumph of thy mute and strange declining

Only one youth and the bright life was shrouded
Only one morning and the day was clouded
And one old age with all regrets is crowded

Oh hush oh hush Thy tears my words are steeping
Oh hush hush hush So full the fount of weeping
Poor eyes so quickly moved so near to sleeping

Pardon the girl such strange desires beset her
Poor woman lay aside the mournful letter
That breaks thy heart the one who wrote forget her

The one who now thy faded features guesses
With filial fingers thy grey hair caresses
With morning tears thy mournful twilight blesses




SONG


As the inhastening tide doth roll
Dear and desired along the whole
 Wide shining strand and floods the caves
 Your love comes filling with happy waves
The open seashore of my soul

But inland from the seaward spaces
None knows not even you the places
 Brimmed at your coming out of sight
 The little solitudes of delight
This tide constrains in dim embraces

You see the happy shore waverimmed
But know not of the quiet dimmed
 Rivers your coming floods and fills
 The little pools mid happier hills
My silent rivulets overbrimmed

What I have secrets from you Yes
But visiting Sea your love doth press
 And reach in further than you know
 And fills all these and when you go
Theres loneliness in loneliness




BUILDERS OF RUINS


We build with strength the deep towerwall
 That shall be shattered thus and thus
And fair and great are court and hall
 But _how_ fairthis is not for us
Who know the lack that lurks in all

We know we know how all too bright
 The hues are that our painting wears
And how the marble gleams too white
 We speak in unknown tongues the years
Interpret everything aright

And crown with weeds our pride of towers
 And warm our marble through with sun
And break our pavements through with flowers
 With an Amen when all is done
Knowing these perfect things of ours

O days we ponder left alone
 Like children in their lonely hour
And in our secrets keep your own
 As seeds the colour of the flower
Today they are not all unknown

The stars that twixt the rise and fall
 Like relicseers shall one by one
Stand musing oer our empty hall
 And setting moons shall brood upon
The frescoes of our inward wall

And when some midsummer shall be
 Hither will come some little one
Dusty with bloom of flowers is he
 Sit on a ruin i the late long sun
And think one foot upon his knee

And where they wrought these lives of ours
 So manyworded manysouled
A Northwest wind will take the towers
 And dark with colour sunny and cold
Will range alone among the flowers

And here or there at our desire
 The little clamorous owl shall sit
Through her still time and we aspire
 To make a law and know not it
Unto the life of a wild briar

Our purpose is distinct and dear
 Though from our open eyes tis hidden
Thou Timetocome shalt make it clear
 Undoing our work we are children chidden
With pity and smiles of many a year

Who shall allot the praise and guess
 What part is yours and what is ours
O years that certainly will bless
 Our flowers with fruits our seeds with flowers
With ruin all our perfectness

Be patient Time of our delays
 Too happy hopes and wasted fears
Our faithful ways our wilful ways
 Solace our labours O our seers
The seasons and our bards the days

And make our pause and silence brim
 With the shrill childrens play and sweets
Of those pathetic flowers and dim
 Of those eternal flowers my Keats
Dying felt growing over him




SONNET


I touched the heart that loved me as a player
 Touches a lyre content with my poor skill
 No touch save mine knew my beloved and still
I thought at times Is there no sweet lost air
Old loves could wake in him I cannot share
 Oh he alone alone could so fulfil
 My thoughts in sound to the measure of my will
He is gone and silence takes me unaware

The songs I knew not he resumes set free
From my constraining love alas for me
 His part in our tune goes with him my part
Is locked in me for ever I stand as mute
 As one with full strong music in his heart
Whose fingers stray upon a shattered lute




SONG OF THE DAY TO THE NIGHT


THE POET SINGS TO HIS POET

From dawn to dusk and from dusk to dawn
 We two are sundered always sweet
A few stars shake oer the rocky lawn
 And the cold seashore when we meet
 The twilight comes with thy shadowy feet

We are not day and night my Fair
 But one It is an hour of hours
And thoughts that are not otherwhere
 Are thought here mid the blown seaflowers
 This meeting and this dusk of ours

Delight has taken Pain to her heart
 And there is dusk and stars for these
Oh linger linger They would not part
 And the wild wind comes from overseas
 With a new song to the olive trees

And when we meet by the sounding pine
 Sleep draws near to his dreamless brother
And when thy sweet eyes answer mine
 Peace nestles close to her mournful mother
 And Hope and Weariness kiss each other




SOEUR MONIQUE


A RONDEAU BY COUPERIN

Quiet form of silent nun
What has given you to my inward eyes
What has marked you unknown one
In the throngs of centuries
That mine ears do listen through
This old masters melody
That expresses you
This admired simplicity
Tender with a serious wit
And two words the name of it
Soeur Monique

And if sad the music is
It is sad with mysteries
Of a small immortal thing
That the passing ages sing
Simple music making mirth
Of the dying and the birth
Of the people of the earth

No not sad we are beguiled
Sad with living as we are
Ours the sorrow outpouring
Sad self on a selfless thing
As our eyes and hearts are mild
With our sympathy for Spring
With a pity sweet and wild
For the innocent and far
With our sadness in a star
Or our sadness in a child

But two words and this sweet air
 Soeur Monique
Had he more who set you there
Was his musicdream of you
Of some perfect nun he knew
Or of some ideal as true

And I see you where you stand
With your life held in your hand
As a rosary of days
And your thoughts in calm arrays
And your innocent prayers are told
On your rosary of days
And the young days and the old
With their quiet prayers did meet
When the chaplet was complete

Did it vex you the surmise
Of this wind of words this storm of cries
 Though you kept the silence so
 In the storms of long ago
 And you keep it like a star
 Of the evils triumphing
Strong for all your perfect conquering
 Silenced conqueror that you are
And I wonder at your peace I wonder
Would it trouble you to know
Tender soul the world and sin
By your calm feet trodden under
 Long ago
Living now mighty to win
And your feet are vanished like the snow

Vanished but the poet he
In whose dream your face appears
He who ranges unknown years
With your music in his heart
Speaks to you familiarly
Where you keep apart
And invents you as you were
And your picture O my nun
Is a strangely easy one
For the holy weed you wear
For your hidden eyes and hidden hair
And in picturing you I may
Scarcely go astray

O the vague reality
The mysterious certainty
O strange truth of these my guesses
In the wide thoughtwildernesses
Truth of one divined of many flowers
Of one raindrop in the showers
Of the longago swift rain
Of one tear of many tears
In some worldrenowned pain
Of one daisy mid the centuries of sun
Of a little living nun
In the garden of the years

Yes I am not far astray
But I guess you as might one
Pausing when young March is grey
In a violetpeopled day
All his thoughts go out to places that he knew
To his childhome in the sun
To the fields of his regret
To one place i the innocent March air
By one olive and invent
The familiar form and scent
Safely a white violet
Certainly is there

Soeur Monique remember me
Tis not in the past alone
I am picturing you to be
But my little friend my own
In my moment pray for me
For another dream is mine
And another dream is true
 Sweeter even
Of the little ones that shine
Lost within the light divine
Of some meekest flower or you
 In the fields of Heaven




IN EARLY SPRING


O Spring I know thee Seek for sweet surprise
 In the young childrens eyes
But I have learnt the years and know the yet
 Leaffolded violet
Mine ear awake to silence can foretell
 The cuckoos fitful bell
I wander in a grey time that encloses
 June and the wild hedgeroses
A years procession of the flowers doth pass
 My feet along the grass
And all you sweet birds silent yet I know
 The notes that stir you so
Your songs yet half devised in the dim dear
 Beginnings of the year
In these young days you meditate your part
 I have it all by heart

I know the secrets of the seeds of flowers
 Hidden and warm with showers
And how in kindling Spring the cuckoo shall
 Alter his interval
But not a flower or song I ponder is
 My own but memorys
I shall be silent in those days desired
 Before a world inspired
O dear brown birds compose your old songphrases
 Earth thy familiar daisies

The poet mused upon the dusky height
 Between two stars towards night
His purpose in his heart I watched a space
 The meaning of his face
There was the secret fled from earth and skies
 Hid in his grey young eyes
My heart and all the Summer wait his choice
 And wonder for his voice
Who shall foretell his songs and who aspire
 But to divine his lyre
Sweet earth we know thy dimmest mysteries
 But he is lord of his




PARTED


Farewell to one now silenced quite
Sent out of hearing out of sight
 My friend of friends whom I shall miss
 He is not banished though for this
Nor he nor sadness nor delight

Though I shall walk with him no more
A low voice sounds upon the shore
 He must not watch my restingplace
 But who shall drive a mournful face
From the sad winds about my door

I shall not hear his voice complain
But who shall stop the patient rain
 His tears must not disturb my heart
 But who shall change the years and part
The world from every thought of pain

Although my life is left so dim
The morning crowns the mountainrim
 Joy is not gone from summer skies
 Nor innocence from childrens eyes
And all these things are part of him

He is not banished for the showers
Yet wake this green warm earth of ours
 How can the summer but be sweet
 I shall not have him at my feet
And yet my feet are on the flowers




REGRETS


As when the seaward ebbing tide doth pour
 Out by the low sand spaces
The parting waves slip back to clasp the shore
 With lingering embraces

So in the tide of life that carries me
 From where thy true heart dwells
Waves of my thoughts and memories turn to thee
 With lessening farewells

Waving of hands dreams when the day forgets
 A care half lost in cares
The saddest of my verses dim regrets
 Thy name among my prayers

I would the day might come so waited for
 So patiently besought
When I returning should fill up once more
 Thy desolated thought

And fill thy loneliness that lies apart
 In still persistent pain
Shall I content thee O thou broken heart
 As the tide comes again

And brims the little seashore lakes and sets
 Seaweeds afloat and fills
The silent pools rivers and rivulets
 Among the inland hills




SONG


My Fair no beauty of thine will last
 Save in my loves eternity
 Thy smiles that light thee fitfully
Are lost for evertheir moment past
 Except the few thou givest to me

Thy sweet words vanish day by day
 As all breath of mortality
 Thy laughter done must cease to be
And all thy dear tones pass away
 Except the few that sing to me

Hide then within my heart oh hide
 All thou art loth should go from thee
 Be kinder to thyself and me
My cupful from this rivers tide
 Shall never reach the long sad sea




SONNETIN FEBRUARY


Rich meanings of the prophetSpring adorn
 Unseen this colourless sky of folded showers
 And folded winds no blossom in the bowers
A poets face asleep is this grey morn

Now in the midst of the old world forlorn
 A mystic child is set in these still hours
 I keep this time even before the flowers
Sacred to all the young and the unborn

To all the miles and miles of unsprung wheat
 And to the Spring waiting beyond the portal
 And to the future of my own young art

And among all these things to you my sweet
 My friend to your calm face and the immortal
 Child tarrying all your lifetime in your heart




SAN LORENZO GIUSTINIANIS MOTHER


I had not seen my sons dear face
He chose the cloister by Gods grace
 Since it had come to full flowertime
 I hardly guessed at its perfect prime
That folded flower of his dear face

Mine eyes were veiled by mists of tears
When on a day in many years
 One of his Order came I thrilled
 Facing I thought that face fulfilled
I doubted for my mists of tears

His blessing be with me for ever
My hope and doubt were hard to sever
 That altered face those holy weeds
 I filled his wallet and kissed his beads
And lost his echoing feet for ever

If to my son my alms were given
I know not and I wait for Heaven
 He did not plead for child of mine
 But for another Child divine
And unto Him it was surely given

There is One alone who cannot change
Dreams are we shadows visions strange
 And all I give is given to One
 I might mistake my dearest son
But never the Son who cannot change




SONNETTHE LOVE OF NARCISSUS


Like him who met his own eyes in the river
 The poet trembles at his own long gaze
 That meets him through the changing nights and days
From out great Nature all her waters quiver
With his fair image facing him for ever
 The music that he listens to betrays
 His own heart to his ears by trackless ways
His wild thoughts tend to him in long endeavour

His dreams are far among the silent hills
 His vague voice calls him from the darkened plain
With winds at night strange recognition thrills
 His lonely heart with piercing love and pain
He knows his sweet mirth in the mountain rills
 His weary tears that touch him with the rain




TO A LOST MELODY


Thou art not dead O sweet lost melody
 Sung beyond memory
When golden to the winds this world of ours
 Waved wild with boundless flowers
Sung in some past when wildernesses were
 Not dead not dead lost air
Yet in the ages long where lurkest thou
 And what soul knows thee now
Wert thou not given to sweeten every wind
 From that oerburdened mind
That bore thee through the young world and that tongue
 By which thou first wert sung
Was not the holy choir the endless dome
 And nature all thy home
Did not the warm gale clasp thee to his breast
 Lulling thy storms to rest
And is the June air laden with thee now
 Passing the summerbough
And is the dawnwind on a lonely sea
 Balmy with thoughts of thee
To rock on daybreak winds dost thou rejoice
 As first on his strong voice
Whose radiant morning soul did give thee birth
 Gave thee to heaven and earth
Or did each bird win one dear note of thee
 To pipe eternally
Art thou the secret of the small fieldflowers
 Nodding thy time for hours
Blown by the happy winds from hill to hill
 And such a secret still
Or wert thou rapt awhile to other spheres
 To gladden tenderer ears
Doth musics soul contain thee precious air
 Sleepest thou clasped there
Until a time shall come for thee to start
 Into some unborn heart
Then wilt thou as the clouds of ages roll
 Thou migratory soul
Amid a different wilder wilderness
 In crowds that throng and press
Revive thy blessed cadences forgotten
 In some soul newbegotten
Oh wilt thou ever tire of thy long rest
 On natures silent breast
And wilt thou leave thy rainbow showers to bear
 A part in human care
Forsake thy boundless silence to make choice
 Of some pathetic voice
Forsake thy stars thy suns thy moons thy skies
 For mans desiring sighs




SONNETTHE POET TO NATURE


I have no secrets from thee lyre sublime
 My lyre whereof I make my melody
 I sing one way like the west wind through thee
With my whole heart and hear thy sweet strings chime

But thou who soundest in my tune and rhyme
 Hast tones I wake not in thy land and sea
 Loveliness not for me secrets from me
Thoughts for another and another time

And as the west wind passed the south wind alters
 His intimate sweet things his hues of noon
 The voices of his waves sound of his pine

The meanings of his lost heartthis thought falters
 In my short songAnother bard shall tune
 Thee my one Lyre to other songs than mine




THE POET TO HIS CHILDHOOD


In my thought I see you stand with a path on either hand
Hills that look into the sun and there a riverd meadowland
And your lost voice with the things that it decreed across me thrills
 When you thought and chose the hills

If it prove a life of pain greater have I judged the gain
With a singing soul for musics sake I climb and meet the rain
And I choose whilst I am calm my thought and labouring to be
 Unconsoled by sympathy

But how dared you use me so For you bring my ripe years low
To your childs whim and a destiny your childsoul could not know
And that small voice legislating I revolt against with tears
 But you mark not through the years

To the mountain leads my way If the plains are green today
These my barren hills are flushing faintly strangely in the May
With the presence of the Spring amongst the smallest flowers that grow
 But the summer in the snow

Do you know who are so bold how in sooth the rule will hold
Settled by a wayward childs ideal at some ten years old
How the human arms you slip from thoughts and love you stay not for
 Will not open to you more

You were rash then little child for the skies with storms are wild
And you faced the dim horizon with its whirl of mists and smiled
Climbed a little higher lonelier in the solitary sun
 To feel how the winds came on

But your sunny silence there solitude so light to bear
Will become a long dumb world up in the colder sadder air
And the little mournful lonelinesses in the little hills
 Wider wilderness fulfils

And if eer you should come down to the village or the town
With the cold rain for your garland and the wind for your renown
You will stand upon the thresholds with a face or dumb desire
 Nor be known by any fire

It is memory that shrinks You were all too brave methinks
Climbing solitudes of flowering cistus and the thin wild pinks
Musing setting to a haunting air in one vague reverie
 All the life that was to be

With a smile do I complain in the safety of the pain
Knowing that my feet can never quit their solitudes again
But regret may turn with longing to that one hours choice you had
 When the silence broodeth sad

I rebel _not_ child gone by but obey you wonderingly
For you knew not young rash speaker all you spoke and now will I
With the life and all the loneliness revealed that you thought fit
 Sing the Amen knowing it




SONNET


A poet of one mood in all my lays
 Ranging all life to sing one only love
 Like a west wind across the world I move
Sweeping my harp of floods mine own wild ways

The countries change but not the westwind days
 Which are my songs My soft skies shine above
 And on all seas the colours of a dove
And on all fields a flash of silver greys

I make the whole world answer to my art
 And sweet monotonous meanings In your ears
I change not ever bearing for my part
 One thought that is the treasure of my years
A small cloud full of rain upon my heart
 And in mine arms clasped like a child in tears




AN UNMARKED FESTIVAL


Theres a feast undated yet
 Both our true lives hold it fast
The first day we ever met
 What a great day came and passed
 Unknown then but known at last

And we met You knew not me
 Mistress of your joys and fears
Held my hands that held the key
 Of the treasure of your years
 Of the fountain of your tears

For you knew not it was I
 And I knew not it was you
We have learnt as days went by
 But a flower struck root and grew
 Underground and no one knew

Days of days Unmarked it rose
 In whose hours we were to meet
And forgotten passed Who knows
 Was earth cold or sunny Sweet
 At the coming of your feet

One mere day we thought the measure
 Of such days the year fulfils
Now how dearly would we treasure
 Something from its fields its rills
 And its memorable hills

But one leaf of oak or lime
 Or one blossom from its bowers
No one gathered at the time
 Oh to keep that day of ours
 By one relic of its flowers




SONNETTHE NEOPHYTE


Who knows what days I answer for today
 Giving the bud I give the flower I bow
 This yet unfaded and a faded brow
Bending these knees and feeble knees I pray

Thoughts yet unripe in me I bend one way
 Give one repose to pain I know not now
 One leaven to joy that comes I guess not how
I dedicate my fields when Spring is grey

Oh rash I smile to pledge my hidden wheat
 I fold today at altars far apart
Hands trembling with what toils In their retreat
 I seal my love tobe my folded art
I light the tapers at my head and feet
 And lay the crucifix on this silent heart




SONNETSPRING ON THE ALBAN HILLS


Oer the Campagna it is dim warm weather
 The Spring comes with a full heart silently
 And many thoughts a faint flash of the sea
Divides two mists straight falls the falling feather

With wild Spring meanings hill and plain together
 Grow pale or just flush with a dust of flowers
 Rome in the ages dimmed with all her towers
Floats in the midst a little cloud at tether

I fain would put my hands about thy face
 Thou with thy thoughts who art another Spring
 And draw thee to me like a mournful child

Thou lookest on me from another place
 I touch not this days secret nor the thing
 That in the silence makes thy sweet eyes wild




SONG OF THE NIGHT AT DAYBREAK


All my stars forsake me
And the dawnwinds shake me
Where shall I betake me

Whither shall I run
Till the set of sun
Till the day be done

To the mountainmine
To the boughs o the pine
To the blind mans eyne

To a brow that is
Bowed upon the knees
Sick with memories




SONNETTO A DAISY


Slight as thou art thou art enough to hide
 Like all created things secrets from me
 And stand a barrier to eternity
And I how can I praise thee well and wide

From where I dwellupon the hither side
 Thou little veil for so great mystery
 When shall I penetrate all things and thee
And then look back For this I must abide

Till thou shalt grow and fold and be unfurled
 Literally between me and the world
 Then I shall drink from in beneath a spring

And from a poets side shall read his book
 O daisy mine what will it be to look
 From Gods side even of such a simple thing




SONNETTO ONE POEM IN A SILENT TIME


Who looked for thee thou little song of mine
 This winter of a silent poets heart
 Is suddenly sweet with thee but what thou art
Midwinter flower I would I could divine

Art thou a last one orphan of thy line
 Did the dead summers last warmth foster thee
 Or is Spring folded up unguessed in me
And stirring out of sightand thou the sign

Where shall I lookbackwards or to the morrow
 For others of thy fragrance secret child
 Who knows if last things or if first things claim thee

Whether thou be the last smile of my sorrow
 Or else a joy too sweet a joy too wild
 How my December violet shall I name thee




FUTURE POETRY


No new delights to our desire
 The singers of the past can yield
 I lift mine eyes to hill and field
And see in them your yet dumb lyre
 Poets unborn and unrevealed

Singers to come what thoughts will start
 To song what words of yours be sent
 Through mans soul and with earth be blent
These worlds of nature and the heart
 Await you like an instrument

Who knows what musical flocks of words
 Upon these pinetree tops will light
 And crown these towers in circling flight
And cross these seas like summer birds
 And give a voice to the day and night

Something of you already is ours
 Some mystic part of you belongs
 To us whose dreams your future throngs
Who look on hills and trees and flowers
 Which will mean so much in your songs

I wonder like the maid who found
 And knelt to lift the lyre supreme
 Of Orpheus from the Thracian stream
She dreams on its sealed past profound
 On a deep future sealed I dream

She bears it in her wanderings
 Within her arms and has not pressed
 Her unskilled fingers but her breast
Upon those silent sacred strings
 I too clasp mystic strings at rest

For I i the world of lands and seas
 The sky of wind and rain and fire
 And in mans world of long desire
In all that is yet dumb in these
 Have found a more mysterious lyre




THE POET SINGS TO HER POET


THE MOON TO THE SUN

As the full moon shining there
To the sun that lighteth her
Am I unto thee for ever
O my secret glorygiver
O my light I am dark but fair
 Black but fair

Shine Earth loves thee And then shine
And be loved through thoughts of mine
All thy secrets that I treasure
I translate them at my pleasure
I am crowned with glory of thine
 Thine not thine

I make pensive thy delight
And thy strong gold silverwhite
Though all beauty of nine thou makest
Yet to earth which thou forsakest
I have made thee fair all night
 Day all night




A POETS SONNET


If I should quit thee sacrifice forswear
 To what my art shall I give thee in keeping
 To the long winds of heaven Shall these come sweeping
My songs forgone against my face and hair

Or shall the mountain streams my lost joys bear
 My past poetic pain in the rain be weeping
 No I shall live a poet waking sleeping
And I shall die a poet unaware

From me my art thou canst not pass away
 And I a singer though I cease to sing
 Shall own thee without joy in thee or woe

Through my indifferent words of every day
 Scattered and all unlinked the rhymes shall ring
 And make my poem and I shall not know




THE MODERN POET


A SONG OF DERIVATIONS

I come from nothing but from where
Come the undying thoughts I bear
 Down through long links of death and birth
 From the past poets of the earth
My immortality is there

I am like the blossom of an hour
But long long vanished sun and shower
 Awoke my breath i the young worlds air
 I track the past back everywhere
Through seed and flower and seed and flower

Or I am like a stream that flows
Full of the cold springs that arose
 In morning lands in distant hills
 And down the plain my channel fills
With melting of forgotten snows

Voices I have not heard possessed
My own fresh songs my thoughts are blessed
 With relics of the far unknown
 And mixed with memories not my own
The sweet streams throng into my breast

Before this life began to be
The happy songs that wake in me
 Woke long ago and far apart
 Heavily on this little heart
Presses this immortality




AFTER A PARTING


Farewell has long been said I have forgone thee
 I never name thee even
But how shall I learn virtues and yet shun thee
 For thou art so near Heaven
That heavenward meditations pause upon thee

Thou dost beset the path to every shrine
 My trembling thoughts discern
Thy goodness in the good for which I pine
 And if I turn from but one sin I turn
Unto a smile of thine

How shall I thrust thee apart
 Since all my growth tends to thee night and day
To thee faith hope and art
 Swift are the currents setting all one way
They draw my life my life out of my heart




RENOUNCEMENT


I must not think of thee and tired yet strong
 I shun the thought that lurks in all delight
 The thought of theeand in the blue Heavens height
And in the sweetest passage of a song

Oh just beyond the fairest thoughts that throng
 This breast the thought of thee waits hidden yet bright
 But it must never never come in sight
I must stop short of thee the whole day long

But when sleep comes to close each difficult day
 When night gives pause to the long watch I keep
 And all my bonds I needs must loose apart

Must doff my will as raiment laid away
 With the first dream that comes with the first sleep
 I run I run I am gathered to thy heart




VENI CREATOR


So humble things Thou hast borne for us O God
Leftst Thou a path of lowliness untrod
Yes one till now another OliveGarden
For we endure the tender pain of pardon
One with another we forbear Give heed
Look at the mournful world Thou hast decreed
The time has come At last we hapless men
Know all our haplessness all through Come then
Endure undreamed humility Lord of Heaven
Come to our ignorant hearts and be forgiven
