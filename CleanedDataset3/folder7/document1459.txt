The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock


 Sio credesse che mia risposta fosse
 A persona che mai tornasse al mondo
 Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse
 Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo
 Non torno vivo alcun siodo il vero
 Senza tema dinfamia ti rispondo



 Let us go then you and I
 When the evening is spread out against the sky
 Like a patient etherized upon a table
 Let us go through certain halfdeserted streets
 The muttering retreats
 Of restless nights in onenight cheap hotels
 And sawdust restaurants with oystershells
 Streets that follow like a tedious argument
 Of insidious intent
 To lead you to an overwhelming question 
 Oh do not ask What is it
 Let us go and make our visit

 In the room the women come and go
 Talking of Michelangelo

 The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the windowpanes
 The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the windowpanes
 Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening
 Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains
 Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys
 Slipped by the terrace made a sudden leap
 And seeing that it was a soft October night
 Curled once about the house and fell asleep

 And indeed there will be time
 For the yellow smoke that slides along the street
 Rubbing its back upon the windowpanes
 There will be time there will be time
 To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet
 There will be time to murder and create
 And time for all the works and days of hands
 That lift and drop a question on your plate
 Time for you and time for me
 And time yet for a hundred indecisions
 And for a hundred visions and revisions
 Before the taking of a toast and tea

 In the room the women come and go
 Talking of Michelangelo

 And indeed there will be time
 To wonder Do I dare and Do I dare
 Time to turn back and descend the stair
 With a bald spot in the middle of my hair
 They will say How his hair is growing thin
 My morning coat my collar mounting firmly to the chin
 My necktie rich and modest but asserted by a simple pin
 They will say But how his arms and legs are thin
 Do I dare
 Disturb the universe
 In a minute there is time
 For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse

 For I have known them all already known them all
 Have known the evenings mornings afternoons
 I have measured out my life with coffee spoons
 I know the voices dying with a dying fall
 Beneath the music from a farther room
 So how should I presume
 And I have known the eyes already known them all
 The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase
 And when I am formulated sprawling on a pin
 When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall
 Then how should I begin
 To spit out all the buttends of my days and ways
 And how should I presume

 And I have known the arms already known them all
 Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
 But in the lamplight downed with light brown hair
 Is it perfume from a dress
 That makes me so digress
 Arms that lie along a table or wrap about a shawl
 And should I then presume
 And how should I begin

    

 Shall I say I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
 And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
 Of lonely men in shirtsleeves leaning out of windows 

 I should have been a pair of ragged claws
 Scuttling across the floors of silent seas

    

 And the afternoon the evening sleeps so peacefully
 Smoothed by long fingers
 Asleep  tired  or it malingers
 Stretched on the floor here beside you and me
 Should I after tea and cakes and ices
 Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis
 But though I have wept and fasted wept and prayed
 Though I have seen my head grown slightly bald brought in upon a platter
 I am no prophetand heres no great matter
 I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker
 And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat and snicker
 And in short I was afraid

 And would it have been worth it after all
 After the cups the marmalade the tea
 Among the porcelain among some talk of you and me
 Would it have been worth while
 To have bitten off the matter with a smile
 To have squeezed the universe into a ball
 To roll it toward some overwhelming question
 To say I am Lazarus come from the dead
 Come back to tell you all I shall tell you all
 If one settling a pillow by her head
 Should say That is not what I meant at all
 That is not it at all

 And would it have been worth it after all
 Would it have been worth while
 After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets
 After the novels after the teacups after the skirts that trail along the
 floor
 And this and so much more
 It is impossible to say just what I mean
 But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen
 Would it have been worth while
 If one settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl
 And turning toward the window should say
 That is not it at all
 That is not what I meant at all

    

 No I am not Prince Hamlet nor was meant to be
 Am an attendant lord one that will do
 To swell a progress start a scene or two
 Advise the prince no doubt an easy tool
 Deferential glad to be of use
 Politic cautious and meticulous
 Full of high sentence but a bit obtuse
 At times indeed almost ridiculous
 Almost at times the Fool

 I grow old  I grow old 
 I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled

 Shall I part my hair behind Do I dare to eat a peach
 I shall wear white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach
 I have heard the mermaids singing each to each

 I do not think that they will sing to me

 I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
 Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
 When the wind blows the water white and black
 We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
 By seagirls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
 Till human voices wake us and we drown




Portrait of a Lady

 Thou hast committed
 Fornication but that was in another country
 And besides the wench is dead
 The Jew Of Malta


 I

 Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
 You have the scene arrange itselfas it will seem to do
 With I have saved this afternoon for you
 And four wax candles in the darkened room
 Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead
 An atmosphere of Juliets tomb
 Prepared for all the things to be said or left unsaid
 We have been let us say to hear the latest Pole
 Transmit the Preludes through his hair and finger tips
 So intimate this Chopin that I think his soul
 Should be resurrected only among friends
 Some two or three who will not touch the bloom
 That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room
 And so the conversation slips
 Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
 Through attenuated tones of violins
 Mingled with remote cornets
 And begins

 You do not know how much they mean to me my friends
 And how how rare and strange it is to find
 In a life composed so much so much of odds and ends
 For indeed I do not love it  you knew you are not blind
 How keen you are
 To find a friend who has these qualities
 Who has and gives
 Those qualities upon which friendship lives
 How much it means that I say this to you
 Without these friendshipslife what cauchemar
 Among the windings of the violins
 And the ariettes
 Of cracked cornets
 Inside my brain a dull tomtom begins
 Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own
 Capricious monotone
 That is at least one definite false note
 Let us take the air in a tobacco trance
 Admire the monuments
 Discuss the late events
 Correct our watches by the public clocks
 Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks


 II

 Now that lilacs are in bloom
 She has a bowl of lilacs in her room
 And twists one in her fingers while she talks
 Ah my friend you do not know you do not know
 What life is you who hold it in your hands
 Slowly twisting the lilac stalks
 You let it flow from you you let it flow
 And youth is cruel and has no remorse
 And smiles at situations which it cannot see
 I smile of course
 And go on drinking tea
 Yet with these April sunsets that somehow recall
 My buried life and Paris in the Spring
 I feel immeasurably at peace and find the world
 To be wonderful and youthful after all

 The voice returns like the insistent outoftune
 Of a broken violin on an August afternoon
 I am always sure that you understand
 My feelings always sure that you feel
 Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand

 You are invulnerable you have no Achilles heel
 You will go on and when you have prevailed
 You can say at this point many a one has failed

 But what have I but what have I my friend
 To give you what can you receive from me
 Only the friendship and the sympathy
 Of one about to reach her journeys end

 I shall sit here serving tea to friends

 I take my hat how can I make a cowardly amends
 For what she has said to me
 You will see me any morning in the park
 Reading the comics and the sporting page
 Particularly I remark
 An English countess goes upon the stage
 A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance
 Another bank defaulter has confessed
 I keep my countenance
 I remain selfpossessed
 Except when a street piano mechanical and tired
 Reiterates some wornout common song
 With the smell of hyacinths across the garden
 Recalling things that other people have desired
 Are these ideas right or wrong


 III

 The October night comes down returning as before
 Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease
 I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door
 And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees

 And so you are going abroad and when do you return
 But thats a useless question
 You hardly know when you are coming back
 You will find so much to learn
 My smile falls heavily among the bricabrac

 Perhaps you can write to me
 My selfpossession flares up for a second
 This is as I had reckoned
 I have been wondering frequently of late
 But our beginnings never know our ends
 Why we have not developed into friends
 I feel like one who smiles and turning shall remark
 Suddenly his expression in a glass
 My selfpossession gutters we are really in the dark

 For everybody said so all our friends
 They all were sure our feelings would relate
 So closely I myself can hardly understand
 We must leave it now to fate
 You will write at any rate
 Perhaps it is not too late
 I shall sit here serving tea to friends

 And I must borrow every changing
 find expression  dance dance
 Like a dancing bear
 Cry like a parrot chatter like an ape
 Let us take the air in a tobacco trance

 Well and what if she should die some afternoon
 Afternoon grey and smoky evening yellow and rose
 Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand
 With the smoke coming down above the housetops
 Doubtful for quite a while
 Not knowing what to feel or if I understand
 Or whether wise or foolish tardy or too soon 
 Would she not have the advantage after all
 This music is successful with a dying fall
 Now that we talk of dying
 And should I have the right to smile




Preludes

 I

 The winter evening settles down
 With smell of steaks in passageways
 Six oclock
 The burntout ends of smoky days
 And now a gusty shower wraps
 The grimy scraps
 Of withered leaves about your feet
 And newspapers from vacant lots
 The showers beat
 On broken blinds and chimneypots
 And at the corner of the street
 A lonely cabhorse steams and stamps
 And then the lighting of the lamps


 II

 The morning comes to consciousness
 Of faint stale smells of beer
 From the sawdusttrampled street
 With all its muddy feet that press
 To early coffeestands
 With the other masquerades
 That time resumes
 One thinks of all the hands
 That are raising dingy shades
 In a thousand furnished rooms


 III

 You tossed a blanket from the bed
 You lay upon your back and waited
 You dozed and watched the night revealing
 The thousand sordid images
 Of which your soul was constituted
 They flickered against the ceiling
 And when all the world came back
 And the light crept up between the shutters
 And you heard the sparrows in the gutters
 You had such a vision of the street
 As the street hardly understands
 Sitting along the beds edge where
 You curled the papers from your hair
 Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
 In the palms of both soiled hands


 IV

 His soul stretched tight across the skies
 That fade behind a city block
 Or trampled by insistent feet
 At four and five and six oclock
 And short square fingers stuffing pipes
 And evening newspapers and eyes
 Assured of certain certainties
 The conscience of a blackened street
 Impatient to assume the world
 I am moved by fancies that are curled
 Around these images and cling
 The notion of some infinitely gentle
 Infinitely suffering thing
 Wipe your hand across your mouth and laugh
 The worlds revolve like ancient women
 Gathering fuel in vacant lots




Rhapsody on a Windy Night

 Twelve oclock
 Along the reaches of the street
 Held in a lunar synthesis
 Whispering lunar incantations
 Dissolve the floors of the memory
 And all its clear relations
 Its divisions and precisions
 Every street lamp that I pass
 Beats like a fatalistic drum
 And through the spaces of the dark
 Midnight shakes the memory
 As a madman shakes a dead geranium

 Halfpast one
 The street lamp sputtered
 The street lamp muttered
 The street lamp said
 Regard that woman
 Who hesitates toward you in the light of the door
 Which opens on her like a grin
 You see the border of her dress
 Is torn and stained with sand
 And you see the corner of her eye
 Twists like a crooked pin

 The memory throws up high and dry
 A crowd of twisted things
 A twisted branch upon the beach
 Eaten smooth and polished
 As if the world gave up
 The secret of its skeleton
 Stiff and white
 A broken spring in a factory yard
 Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
 Hard and curled and ready to snap

 Halfpast two
 The street lamp said
 Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter
 Slips out its tongue
 And devours a morsel of rancid butter
 So the hand of a child automatic
 Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay
 I could see nothing behind that childs eye
 I have seen eyes in the street
 Trying to peer through lighted shutters
 And a crab one afternoon in a pool
 An old crab with barnacles on his back
 Gripped the end of a stick which I held him

 Halfpast three
 The lamp sputtered
 The lamp muttered in the dark

 The lamp hummed
 Regard the moon
 La lune ne garde aucune rancune
 She winks a feeble eye
 She smiles into corners
 She smoothes the hair of the grass
 The moon has lost her memory
 A washedout smallpox cracks her face
 Her hand twists a paper rose
 That smells of dust and old Cologne
 She is alone
 With all the old nocturnal smells
 That cross and cross across her brain
 The reminiscence comes
 Of sunless dry geraniums
 And dust in crevices
 Smells of chestnuts in the streets
 And female smells in shuttered rooms
 And cigarettes in corridors
 And cocktail smells in bars

 The lamp said
 Four oclock
 Here is the number on the door
 Memory
 You have the key
 The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair
 Mount
 The bed is open the toothbrush hangs on the wall
 Put your shoes at the door sleep prepare for life

 The last twist of the knife




Morning at the Window

 They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens
 And along the trampled edges of the street
 I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids
 Sprouting despondently at area gates

 The brown waves of fog toss up to me
 Twisted faces from the bottom of the street
 And tear from a passerby with muddy skirts
 An aimless smile that hovers in the air
 And vanishes along the level of the roofs




The Boston Evening Transcript

 The readers of the Boston Evening Transcript
 Sway in the blind like a field of ripe corn
 When evening quickens faintly in the street
 Wakening the appetites of life in some
 And to others bringing the Boston Evening Transcript
 I mount the steps and ring the bell turning
 Wearily as one would turn to nod goodbye to Rochefoucauld
 If the street were time and he at the end of the street
 And I say Cousin Harriet here is the Boston Evening Transcript




Aunt Helen

 Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt
 And lived in a small house near a fashionable square
 Cared for by servants to the number of four
 Now when she died there was silence in heaven
 And silence at her end of the street
 The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet
 He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before
 The dogs were handsomely provided for
 But shortly afterwards the parrot died too
 The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece
 And the footman sat upon the diningtable
 Holding the second housemaid on his knees
 Who had always been so careful while her mistress lived




Cousin Nancy

 Miss Nancy Ellicot
 Strode across the hills and broke them
 Rode across the hills and broke them
 The barren New England hills
 Riding to hounds
 Over the cowpasture

 Miss Nancy Ellicott smoked
 And danced all the modern dances
 And her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it
 But they knew that it was modern

 Upon the glazen shelves kept watch
 Matthew and Waldo guardians of the faith
 The army of unalterable law




Mr Apollinax

 When Mr Apollinax visited the United States
 His laughter tinkled among the teacups
 I thought of Fragilion that shy figure among the birchtrees
 And of Priapus in the shrubbery
 Gaping at the lady in the swing
 In the palace of Mrs Phlaccus at Professor ChanningCheetahs
 He laughed like an irresponsible foetus
 His laughter was submarine and profound
 Like the old man of the seats
 Hidden under coral islands
 Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence
 Dropping from fingers of surf
 I looked for the head of Mr Apollinax rolling under a chair
 Or grinning over a screen
 With seaweed in its hair
 I heard the beat of centaurs hoofs over the hard turf
 As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon
 He is a charming manBut after all what did he mean
 He has pointed ears  he must be unbalanced
 There was something he said that I might have challenged
 Of dowager Mrs Phlaccus and Professor and Mrs Cheetah
 I remember a slice of lemon and a bitten macaroon




Hysteria

 As she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and
 being part of it until her teeth were only accidental stars with a
 talent for squaddrill I was drawn in by short gasps inhaled at
 each momentary recovery lost finally in the dark caverns of her
 throat bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles An elderly waiter
 with trembling hands was hurriedly spreading a pink and white checked
 cloth over the rusty green iron table saying If the lady and
 gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden if the lady and
 gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden  I decided that
 if the shaking of her breasts could be stopped some of the fragments
 of the afternoon might be collected and I concentrated my attention
 with careful subtlety to this end




Conversation Galante

 I observe Our sentimental friend the moon
 Or possibly fantastic I confess
 It may be Prester Johns balloon
 Or an old battered lantern hung aloft
 To light poor travellers to their distress
 She then How you digress

 And I then Some one frames upon the keys
 That exquisite nocturne with which we explain
 The night and moonshine music which we seize
 To body forth our own vacuity
 She then Does this refer to me
 Oh no it is I who am inane

 You madam are the eternal humorist
 The eternal enemy of the absolute
 Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist
 With your air indifferent and imperious
 At a stroke our mad poetics to confute
 AndAre we then so serious




La Figlia Che Piange

 Stand on the highest pavement of the stair
 Lean on a garden urn
 Weave weave the sunlight in your hair
 Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise
 Fling them to the ground and turn
 With a fugitive resentment in your eyes
 But weave weave the sunlight in your hair

 So I would have had him leave
 So I would have had her stand and grieve
 So he would have left
 As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised
 As the mind deserts the body it has used
 I should find
 Some way incomparably light and deft
 Some way we both should understand
 Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand

 She turned away but with the autumn weather
 Compelled my imagination many days
 Many days and many hours
 Her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers
 And I wonder how they should have been together
 I should have lost a gesture and a pose
 Sometimes these cogitations still amaze
 The troubled midnight and the noons repose

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

assistance they need is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms

remain freely available for generations to come In 2001 the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations
