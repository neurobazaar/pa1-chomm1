Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtytwo text
files per month or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 10 of the present number of computer users 2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that so it
will require us reaching less than 5 of the users in 2001

JAMES WHITCOMB RILEYA SKETCH


On Sunday morning October seventh 1849 Reuben A Riley and his
wife Elizabeth Marine Riley rejoiced over the birth of their
second son They called him James Whitcomb This was in a shady
little street in the shady little town of Greenfield which is in
the county of Hancock and the state of Indiana The young James
found a brother and a sister waiting to greet himJohn Andrew
and Martha Celestia and afterward came Elva MayMrs Henry
Eitel Alexander Humbolt and Mary Elizabeth who of all alone
lives to see this collection of her brothers poems

James Whitcomb was a slender lad with cornsilk hair and wide
blue eyes He was shy and timid not strong physically dreading
the cold of winter and avoiding the rougher sports of his
playmates And yet he was full of the spirit of youth a spirit
that manifested itself in the performance of many ingenious
pranks His everyday life was that of the average boy in the
average country town of that day but his home influences were
exceptional His father who became a captain of cavalry in the
Civil War was a lawyer of ability and an orator of more than
local distinction His mother was a woman of rare strength of
character combined with deep sympathy and a clear understanding
Together they made home a place to remember with thankful heart

When James was twenty years old the death of his mother made a
profound impression on him an impression that has influenced
much of his verse and has remained with him always

At an early age he was sent to school and then sent back
again to use his own words He was restive under what he
called the iron discipline A number of years ago he spoke
of these early educational beginnings in phrases so picturesque
and so characteristic that they are quoted in full

My first teacher was a little old woman rosy and rolypoly who
looked as though she might have just come tumbling out of a fairy
story so lovable was she and so jolly and so amiable She kept
school in her little DameTrot kind of dwelling of three rooms
with a porch in the rear like a bracket on the wall which was
part of the playground of her scholarsfor in those days
pupils were called scholars by their affectionate teachers
Among the twelve or fifteen boys and girls who were there I
remember particularly a little lame boy who always got the first
ride in the locusttree swing during recess

This first teacher of mine was a mother to all her scholars
and in every way looked after their comfort especially when
certain little ones grew drowsy I was often with others
carried to the sittingroom and left to slumber on a small made
down pallet on the floor She would sometimes take three or four
of us together and I recall how a playmate and I having been
admonished into silence grew deeply interested in watching a
spare old man who sat at a window with its shade drawn down
After a while we became accustomed to this odd sight and would
laugh and talk in whispers and give imitations as we sat in a
low sewingchair of the little old pendulating blind man at the
window Well the old man was the gentle teachers charge and
for this reason possibly her life had become an heroic one
caring for her helpless husband who quietly content waited
always at the window for his sight to come back to him And
doubtless it is today as he sits at another casement and sees
not only his earthly friends but all the friends of the Eternal
Home with the smiling loyal loving little woman forever at his
side

She was the kindliest of souls even when constrained to punish
us After a whipping she invariably took me into the little
kitchen and gave me two great white slabs of bread cemented
together with layers of butter and jam As she always whipped me
with the same slender switch she used for a pointer and cried
over every lick you will have an idea how much punishment I
could stand When I was old enough to be lifted by the ears out
of my seat that office was performed by a pedagogue whom I
promised to whip sure if hed just wait till I got big enough
He is still waiting

There was but one book at school in which I found the slightest
interest McGuffeys old leatherbound Sixth Reader It was the
tallest book known and to the boys of my size it was a matter of
eternal wonder how I could belong to the big class in that
reader When we were to read the death of Little Nell I
would run away for I knew it would make me cry that the other
boys would laugh at me and the whole thing would become
ridiculous I couldnt bear that A later teacher Captain Lee
O Harris came to understand me with thorough sympathy took
compassion on my weaknesses and encouraged me to read the best
literature He understood that he couldnt get numbers into my
head You couldnt tamp them in History I also disliked as a
dry thing without juice and dates melted out of my memory as
speedily as tinfoil on a redhot stove But I always was ready
to declaim and took natively to anything dramatic or theatrical
Captain Harris encouraged me in recitation and reading and had
ever the sweet spirit of a companion rather than the manner of an
instructor

But if there was only one book at school in which he found the
slightest interest he had before that time displayed an
affection for a booksimply as such and not for any printed word
it might contain And this after all is the true booklovers
love Speaking of this incidentand he liked to refer to it
as his first literary recollection he said Long
before I was old enough to read I remember buying a book at an
old auctioneers shop in Greenfield I can not imagine what
prophetic impulse took possession of me and made me forego the
ginger cakes and the candy that usually took every cent of my
youthful income The slender little volume must have cost all of
twentyfive cents It was Francis Quarles Divine Emblemsa
neat little affair about the size of a pocket Testament I
carried it around with me all day long delighted with the very
feel of it

 What have you got there Bub some one would ask A book
I would reply What kind of a book Poetrybook Poetry
would be the amused exclamation Can you read poetry and
embarrassed Id shake my head and make my escape but I held on
to the beloved little volume

Every boy has an early determinationa first oneto follow some
ennobling profession once he has come to mans estate such as
being a policeman or a performer on the high trapeze The poet
would not have been the Peoples Laureate had his fairy god
mother granted his boywish but the Greenfield baker For to
his childish mind it seemed the acme of delight using again
his own happy expression to manufacture those snowy loaves of
bread those delicious tarts those toothsome bonbons And then
to own them all to keep them in store to watch over and
guardedly exhibit The thought of getting money for them was
to me a sacrilege Sell them No indeed Eat emeat em by
tray loads and dray loads It was a great wonder to me why the
palefaced baker in our town did not eat all his good things
This I determined to do when I became owner of such a grand
establishment Yes sir I would have a glorious feast Maybe
Id have Tom and Harry and perhaps little Kate and Florry in to
help us once in a while The thought of these playmates as
grownup folks didnt appeal to me I was but a child with
wideopen eyes a healthy appetite and a wondering mind That
was all But I have the same sweet tooth today and every time
I pass a confectioners shop I think of the big baker of our
town and Tom and Harry and the youngsters all

As a child he often went with his father to the courthouse
where the lawyers and clerks playfully called him judge Wick
Here as a privileged character he met and mingled with the
country folk who came to sue and be sued and thus early the
dialect the native speech the quaint expressions of his own
people were made familiar to him and took firm root in the
fresh soil of his young memory At about this time he made his
first poetic attempt in a valentine which he gave to his mother
Not only did he write the verse but he drew a sketch to
accompany it greatly to his mothers delight who according to
the best authority gave the young poet three big cookies and
didnt spank me for two weeks This was my earliest literary
encouragement

Shortly after his sixteenth birthday young Riley turned his back
on the little schoolhouse and for a time wandered through the
different fields of art indulging a slender talent for painting
until he thought he was destined for the brush and palette and
then making merry with various musical instruments the banjo
the guitar the violin until finally he appeared as bass drummer
in a brass band In a few weeks he said I had beat myself
into the more enviable position of snare drummer Then I wanted
to travel with a circus and dangle my legs before admiring
thousands over the back seat of a Golden Chariot In a dearth of
comic songs for the banjo and guitar I had written two or three
myself and the idea took possession of me that I might be a
clown introduced as a charactersongman and the composer of my
own ballads

My father was thinking of something else however and one day I
found myself with a fiveought paint brush under the eaves of
an old frame house that drank paint by the bucketful learning to
be a painter Finally I graduated as a house sign and
ornamental painter and for two summers traveled about with a
small company of young fellows calling ourselves The Graphics
who covered all the barns and fences in the state with
advertisements

At another time his young mans fancy saw attractive
possibilities in the village printshop and later his
ambition was diverted to acting encouraged by the good times he
had in the theatricals of the Adelphian Society of Greenfield
In my dreamy way he afterward said I did a little of a
number of things fairly wellsang played the guitar and violin
acted painted signs and wrote poetry My father did not
encourage my versemaking for he thought it too visionary and
being a visionary himself he believed he understood the dangers
of following the promptings of the poetic temperament I doubted
if anything would come of the versewriting myself At this time
it is easy to picture my father a lawyer of ability regarding
me nonplused as the worst case he had ever had He wanted me
to do something practical besides being ambitious for me to
follow in his footsteps and at last persuaded me to settle down
and read law in his office This I really tried to do
conscientiously but finding that political economy and
Blackstone did not rhyme and that the study of law was
unbearable I slipped out of the office one summer afternoon
when all outdoors called imperiously shook the last dusty
premise from my head and was away

The immediate instigator of my flight was a traveling medicine
man who appealed to me for this reason My health was bad very
badas bad as I was Our doctor had advised me to travel but
how could I travel without money The medicine man needed an
assistant and I plucked up courage to ask if I could join the
party and paint advertisements for him

I rode out of town with that glittering cavalcade without saying
goodby to any one and though my patron was not a diplomaed
doctor as I found out he was a man of excellent habits and the
whole company was made up of good straight boys jolly chirping
vagabonds like myself It was delightful to bowl over the
country in that way I laughed all the time Miles and miles of
somber landscape were made bright with merry song and when the
sun shone and all the golden summer lay spread out before us it
was glorious just to drift on through it like a wisp of
thistledown careless of how or when or where the wind should
anchor us Theres a tang of gipsy blood in my veins that pants
for the sun and the air

My duty proper was the manipulation of two blackboards swung at
the sides of the wagon during our street lecture and concert
These boards were alternately embellished with colored drawings
illustrative of the manifold virtues of the nostrum vended
Sometimes I assisted the musical olio with dialect recitations
and character sketches from the back step of the wagon These
selections in the main originated from incidents and experiences
along the route and were composed on dull Sundays in lonesome
little towns where even the church bells seemed to bark at us


On his return to Greenfield after this delightful but profitless
tour he became the local editor of his home paper and in a few
months strangled the little thing into a change of ownership
The new proprietor transferred him to the literary department and
the latter not knowing what else to put in the space allotted
him filled it with verse But there was not room in his
department for all he produced so he began timidly to offer
his poetic wares in foreign markets The editor of The
Indianapolis Mirror accepted two or three shorter verses but in
doing so suggested that in the future he try prose Being but an
humble beginner Riley harkened to the advice whereupon the
editor made a further suggestion this time that he try poetry
again The Danbury Connecticut News then at the height of its
humorous reputation accepted a contribution shortly after The
Mirror episode and Mr McGeechy its managing editor wrote the
young poet a graceful note of congratulation Commenting on
these parlous times Riley afterward wrote It is strange how
little a thing sometimes makes or unmakes a fellow In these
dark days I should have been content with the twinkle of the
tiniest star but even this light was withheld from me Just
then came the letter from McGeechy and about the same time
arrived my first check a payment from Hearth and Home for a
contribution called A Destiny now A Dreamer in A Child World
The letter was signed Editor and unless sent by an assistant
it must have come from Ik Marvel himself God bless him I
thought my fortune made Almost immediately I sent off another
contribution whereupon to my dismay came this reply The
management has decided to discontinue the publication and hopes
that you will find a market for your worthy work elsewhere
Then followed dark days indeed until finally inspired by my old
teacher and comrade Captain Lee O Harris I sent some of my
poems to Longfellow who replied in his kind and gentle manner
with the substantial encouragement for which I had long
thirsted

In the year following Riley formed a connection with The
Anderson Indiana Democrat and contributed verse and locals in
more than generous quantities He was happy in this work and had
begun to feel that at last he was making progress when evil
fortune knocked at his door and conspiring with circumstances
and a friend or two induced the young poet to devise what
afterward seemed to him the gravest of mistakesthe Poepoem
hoax He was then writing for an audience of county papers and
never dreamed that this whimsical bit of fooling would be carried
beyond such boundaries It was suggested by these circumstances

He was inwardly distressed by the belief that his failure to get
the magazines to accept his verse was due to his obscurity while
outwardly he was harassed to desperation by the junior editor of
the rival paper who jeered daily at his poetical pretensions
So to prove that editors would praise from a known source what
they did not hesitate to condemn from one unknown and to silence
his nagging contemporary he wrote Leonainie in the style of
Poe concocting a story to accompany the poem setting forth how
Poe came to write it and how all these years it had been lost to
view In a few words Mr Riley related the incident and then
dismissed it I studied Poes methods He seemed to have a
theory rather misty to be sure about the use of ms and ns
and mellifluous vowels and sonorous words I remember that I was
a long time in evolving the name Leonainie but at length the
verses were finished and ready for trial

A friend the editor of The Kokomo Dispatch undertook the
launching of the hoax in his paper he did this with great
editorial gusto while at the same time I attacked the
authenticity of the poem in The Democrat That diverted all
possible suspicion from me The hoax succeeded far too well for
what had started as a boyish prank became a literary discussion
nationwide and the necessary expose had to be made I was
appalled at the result The press assailed me furiously and
even my own paper dismissed me because I had given the
discovery to a rival

Two dreary and disheartening years followed this tragic event
years in which the young poet found no present help nor future
hope But over in Indianapolis twenty miles away happier
circumstances were shaping themselves Judge E B Martindale
editor and proprietor of The Indianapolis Journal had been
attracted by certain poems in various papers over the state and
at the very time that the poet was ready to confess himself
beaten the judge wrote Come over to Indianapolis and well
give you a place on The Journal Mr Riley went That was the
turning point and though the skies were not always clear nor
the way easy still from that time it was ever an ascending
journey As soon as he was comfortably settled in his new
position the first of the Benj F Johnson poems made its
appearance These dialect verses were introduced with editorial
comment as coming from an old Boone county farmer and their
reception was so cordial so enthusiastic indeed that the
business manager of The Journal Mr George C Hitt privately
published them in pamphlet form and sold the first edition of one
thousand copies in local bookstores and over The Journal office
counter This marked an epoch in the young poets progress and
was the beginning of a friendship between him and Mr Hitt that
has never known interruption This first edition of The Old
Swimmin Hole and Leven More Poems has since become extremely
rare and now commands a high premium A second edition was
promptly issued by a local book dealer whose successors The
BowenMerrill Companynow The BobbsMerrill Companyhave
continued practically without interruption to publish Rileys
work

The call to read from the public platform had by this time become
so insistent that Riley could no longer resist it although
modesty and shyness fought the battle for privacy He told
briefly and in his own inimitable fashion of these trying
experiences In boyhood I had been vividly impressed with
Dickens success in reading from his own works and dreamed that
some day I might follow his example At first I read at Sunday
school entertainments and later on special occasions such as
Memorial Days and Fourth of Julys At last I mustered up
sufficient courage to read in a city theater where despite the
conspiracy of a rainy night and a circus I got encouragement
enough to lead me to extend my efforts And so my native state
and then the country at large were called upon to bear with me
and I think I visited every sequestered spot north or south
particularly distinguished for poor railroad connections At
different times I shared the program with Mark Twain Robert J
Burdette and George Cable and for a while my gentlest and
cheeriest of friends Bill Nye joined with me and made the dusty
detested travel almost a delight We were constantly playing
practical jokes on each other or indulging in some mischievous
banter before the audience On one occasion Mr Nye coming
before the footlights for a word of general introduction said
Ladies and gentlemen the entertainment tonight is of a dual
nature Mr Riley and I will speak alternately First I come
out and talk until I get tired then Mr Riley comes out and
talks until YOU get tired And thus the trips went merrily
enough at times and besides I learned to know in Bill Nye a man
blessed with as noble and heroic a heart as ever beat But the
making of trains which were all in conspiracy to outwit me
schedule or no schedule and the rush and tyrannical pressure of
inviolable engagements some hundred to a season and from Boston
to San Francisco were a distress to my soul I am glad thats
over with Imagine yourself on a crowded daylong excursion
imagine that you had to ride all the way on the platform of the
car then imagine that you had to ride all the way back on the
same platform and lastly try to imagine how you would feel if
you did that every day of your life and you will then get a
glimmera faint glimmerof how one feels after traveling about
on a reading or lecturing tour

All this time I had been writing whenever there was any strength
left in me I could not resist the inclination to write It was
what I most enjoyed doing And so I wrote laboriously ever
more often using the rubber end of the pencil than the point

In my readings I had an opportunity to study and find out for
myself what the public wants and afterward I would endeavor to
use the knowledge gained in my writing The public desires
nothing but what is absolutely natural and so perfectly natural
as to be fairly artless It can not tolerate affectation and it
takes little interest in the classical production It demands
simple sentiments that come direct from the heart While on the
lecture platform I watched the effect that my readings had on the
audience very closely and whenever anybody left the hall I knew
that my recitation was at fault and tried to find out why Once
a man and his wife made an exit while I was giving The Happy
Little Cripplea recitation I had prepared with particular
enthusiasm and satisfaction It fulfilled as few poems do all
the requirements of length climax and those many necessary
features for a recitation The subject was a theme of real
pathos beautified by the cheer and optimism of the little
sufferer Consequently when this couple left the hall I was very
anxious to know the reason and asked a friend to find out He
learned that they had a little hunchback child of their own
After this experience I never used that recitation again On the
other hand it often required a long time for me to realize that
the public would enjoy a poem which because of some blind
impulse I thought unsuitable Once a man said to me Why dont
you recite When the Frost Is on the Punkin The use of it had
never occurred to me for I thought it wouldnt go He
persuaded me to try it and it became one of my most favored
recitations Thus I learned to judge and value my verses by
their effect upon the public Occasionally at first I had
presumed to write over the heads of the audience consoling
myself for the cool reception by thinking my auditors were not of
sufficient intellectual height to appreciate my efforts But
after a time it came home to me that I myself was at fault in
these failures and then I disliked anything that did not appeal
to the public and learned to discriminate between that which did
not ring true to my hearers and that which won them by virtue of
its truthfulness and was simply heart high

As a reader of his own poems as a teller of humorous stories as
a mimic indeed as a finished actor Rileys genius was rare and
beyond question In a lecture on the Humorous Story Mark Twain
referring to the story of the One Legged Soldier and the
different ways of telling it once said

It takes only a minute and a half to tell it in its comic form
and it isnt worth telling after all Put into the
humorousstory form it takes ten minutes and is about the
funniest thing I have ever listened toas James Whitcomb Riley
tells it

The simplicity and innocence and sincerity and unconsciousness
of Rileys old farmer are perfectly simulated and the result is
a performance which is thoroughly charming and delicious This
is artand fine and beautiful and only a master can compass
it

It was in that The Old Swimmin Hole and Leven More
Poems first appeared in volume form Four years afterward Riley
made his initial appearance before a New York City audience The
entertainment was given in aid of an international copyright law
and the countrys most distinguished men of letters took part in
the program It is probably true that no one appearing at that
time was less known to the vast audience in Chickering Hall than
James Whitcomb Riley but so great and so spontaneous was the
enthusiasm when he left the stage after his contribution to the
first days program that the management immediately announced a
place would be made for Mr Riley on the second and last days
program It was then that James Russell Lowell introduced him in
the following words

Ladies and gentlemen I have very great pleasure in presenting
to you the next reader of this afternoon Mr James Whitcomb
Riley of Indiana I confess with no little chagrin and sense
of my own loss that when yesterday afternoon from this
platform I presented him to a similar assemblage I was almost
completely a stranger to his poems But since that time I have
been looking into the volumes that have come from his pen and in
them I have discovered so much of high worth and tender quality
that I deeply regret I had not long before made acquaintance with
his work Today in presenting Mr Riley to you I can say to
you of my own knowledge that you are to have the pleasure of
listening to the voice of a true poet


Two years later a selection from his poems was published in
England under the title Old Fashioned Roses and his
international reputation was established In his own country the
people had already conferred their highest degrees on him and now
the colleges and universitiesseats of conservatismgave him
scholastic recognition Yale made him an Honorary Master of Arts
in 1902 in 1903 Wabash and a year later the University of
Pennsylvania conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Letters
and in 1907 Indiana University gave him his LL D Still more
recently the Academy of Arts and Letters elected him to
membership and in 1912 awarded him the gold medal for poetry
About this time a yet dearer more touching tribute came to him
from school children On October 7 1911 the schools of Indiana
and New York City celebrated his birthday by special exercises
and one year later the school children of practically every
section of the country had programs in his honor

As these distinguished honors came they found him each time
surprised anew and though proud that they who dwell in the high
places of learning should come in cap and gown to welcome him
yet gently and sincerely protesting his own unworthiness And as
they found him when they came so they left him

Mr Riley made his home in Indianapolis from the time judge
Martindale invited him to join The Journals forces and no one
of her citizens was more devoted nor was any so universally
loved and honored Everywhere he went the tribute of quick
recognition and cheery greeting was paid him and his home was
the shrine of every visiting Hoosier High on a sward of velvet
grass stands a dignified middleaged brick house A dwarfed
stone wall broken by an iron gate guards the front lawn while
in the rear an oldfashioned garden revels in hollyhocks and wild
roses Here among his books and his souvenirs the poet spent his
happy and contented days To reach this restful spot the
pilgrim must journey to Lockerbie Street a miniature
thoroughfare half hidden between two more commanding avenues It
is little more than a lane shaded unpaved and from end to end
no longer than a five minutes walk but its fame is for all
time

 Such a dear little street it is nestled away
 From the noise of the city and heat of the day
 In cool shady coverts of whispering trees
 With their leaves lifted up to shake hands with the breeze
 Which in all its wide wanderings never may meet
 With a restingplace fairer than Lockerbie Street


Riley never married He lived with devoted loyal and
understanding friends a part of whose life he became many years
ago Kindly consideration gentle affection peace and order
all that go to make home home were found here blooming with the
hollyhocks and the wild roses Every day some visitor knocked
for admittance and was not denied every day saw the poet calling
for some companionable friend and driving with him through the
citys shaded streets or far out into the country

And so his life drew on to its last and most beautiful year
Since his serious illness in 1910 the public had shown its love
for him more and more frequently On the occasion of his
birthday in 1912 Greenfield had welcomed him home through a host
of children scattering flowers Anderson where he was living
when he first gained public recognition had a Riley Day in 1913

The Indiana State University entertained him the same year as
did also the city of Cincinnati In 1915 there was a Riley Day
at Columbus Indiana and during all this time each birthday and
Christmas was marked by poetryshowers and by thousands of
letters of affectionate congratulation and by many tributes in
the newspapers and magazines

His last birthday October 7 1915 was the most notable of all
Honorable Franklin K Lane Secretary of the Interior suggested
to the various school superintendents that one of Rileys poems
be read in each schoolhouse with the result that Riley
celebrations were general among the children of the entire
country In a proclamation by Governor Ralston the State of
Indiana designated the anniversary as Riley Day in honor of its
most beloved citizen Thousands of letters and gifts from the
poets friends poured inletters from schools and organizations
and Riley Clubs as well as from individualswhile flowers came
from every section of the country Among them all perhaps the
poet was most pleased with a bunch of violets picked from the
banks of the Brandywine by the children of a Riley school

It was on this last birthday that an afternoon festival of Riley
poems set to music and danced in pantomime took place at
Indianapolis This was followed at night by a dinner in his
honor at which Charles Warren Fairbanks presided and the
speakers were Governor Ralston Doctor John Finley Colonel
George Harvey Young E Allison William Allen White George Ade
ExSenator Beveridge and Senator Kern That night Riley smiled
his most wonderful smile his dimpled boyish smile and when he
rose to speak it was with a perceptible quaver in his voice that
he said Everywhere the faces of friends a beautiful throng of
friends

The winter and spring following Riley spent quietly at Miami
Florida where he had gone the two previous seasons to escape the
cold and the rain There was a Riley Day at Miami in February
In April he returned home feeling at his best and as if by
premonition sought out many of his friends new and old and
took them for last rides in his automobile A few days before
the end he visited Greenfield to attend the funeral of a dear
boyhood chum Almon Keefer of whom he wrote in A ChildWorld
All Rileys old friends who were still left in Greenfield were
gathered there and to them he spoke words of faith and good
cheer Almon Keefer had just slipped out quietly and
peacefully he said and it was beautiful

And as quietly and peacefully his own end cameas he had desired
it with no dimming of the faculties even to the very close nor
suffering nor confronting death This was Saturday night July
22 1916 On Monday afternoon and evening his body lay in state
under the dome of Indianas capitol while the people filed by
thousands upon thousands Business men were there and
schoolgirls matrons carrying market baskets mothers with little
children here and there a swarthy foreigner old folks too and
welldressed youths here a farmer and his wife and there a
workman in a blue jumper with his hat in his band silent
inarticulate yet bidding his goodby too On the following
day with only his nearest and dearest about him all that was
mortal of the peoples poet was quietly and simply laid to rest



The Complete Works
of James Whitcomb Riley

A BACKWARD LOOK

As I sat smoking alone yesterday
 And lazily leaning back in my chair
Enjoying myself in a general way
Allowing my thoughts a holiday
 From weariness toil and care
My fanciesdoubtless for ventilation
 Left ajar the gates of my mind
And Memory seeing the situation
 Slipped out in the street of Auld Lang Syne


Wandering ever with tireless feet
 Through scenes of silence and jubilee
Of longhushed voices and faces sweet
Were thronging the shadowy side of the street
 As far as the eye could see
Dreaming again in anticipation
 The same old dreams of our boyhoods days
That never come true from the vague sensation
 Of walking asleep in the worlds strange ways

Away to the house where I was born
 And there was the selfsame clock that ticked
From the close of dusk to the burst of morn
When lifewarm hands plucked the golden corn
 And helped when the apples were picked
And the chany dog on the mantelshelf
 With the gilded collar and yellow eyes
Looked just as at first when I hugged myself
 Sound asleep with the dear surprise

And down to the swing in the locusttree
 Where the grass was worn from the trampled ground
And where Eck Skinner Old Carr and three
Or four such other boys used to be
 Doin skyscrapers or whirlin round
And again Bob climbed for the bluebirds nest
 And again had shows in the buggyshed
Of Guymons barn where still unguessed
 The old ghosts romp through the best days dead

And again I gazed from the old schoolroom
 With a wistful look of a long June day
When on my cheek was the hectic bloom
Caught of Mischief as I presume
 He had such a partial way
It seemed toward meAnd again I thought
 Of a probable likelihood to be
Kept in after schoolfor a girl was caught
 Catching a note from me

And down through the woods to the swimminghole
 Where the big white hollow old sycamore grows
And we never cared when the water was cold
And always ducked the boy that told
 On the fellow that tied the clothes
When life went so like a dreamy rhyme
 That it seems to me now that then
The world was having a jollier time
 Than it ever will have again



PHILIPER FLASH

Young Philiper Flash was a promising lad
His intentions were goodbut oh how sad
 For a person to think
 How the veriest pink
And bloom of perfection may turn out bad
Old Flash himself was a moral man
And prided himself on a moral plan
 Of a maxim as old
 As the calf of gold
Of making that boy do what he was told

And such a good mother had Philiper Flash
Her voice was as soft as the creamy plash
 Of the milky wave
 With its musical lave
That gushed through the holes of her patent churndash
And the excellent woman loved Philiper so
She could cry sometimes when he stumped his toe
 And she stroked his hair
 With such motherly care
When the dear little angel learned to swear

Old Flash himself would sometimes say
That his wife had such a ridiculous way
 Shed humor that child
 Till hed soon be spiled
And then thered be the devil to pay
And the excellent wife with a martyrs look
Would tell old Flash himself he took
 No notice at all
 Of the brighteyed doll
Unless when he spanked him for getting a fall

Young Philiper Flash as time passed by
Grew into a boy with a roguish eye
 He could smoke a cigar
 And seemed by far
The most promising youthHes powerful sly
Old Flash himself once told a friend
Every copper he gets hes sure to spend
 And said he dont you know
 If he keeps on so
What a crop of wild oats the boy will grow

But his dear good mother knew Philipers ways
Sowell she managed the money to raise
 And old Flash himself
 Was laid on the shelf
In the manner of speaking we have nowadays
For gracious knows her darling child
If he went without money hed soon grow wild
 So Philiper Flash
 With a regular dash
Swung on to the reins and went slingin the cash

As old Flash himself in his office one day
Was shaving notes in a barberous way
 At the hour of four
 Death entered the door
And shaved the note on his life they say
And he had for his grave a magnificent tomb
Though the venturous finger that pointed Gone Home
 Looked white and cold
 From being so bold
As it feared that a popular lie was told

Young Philiper Flash was a man of style
When he first began unpacking the pile
 Of the dollars and dimes
 Whose jingling chimes
Had clinked to the tune of his fathers smile
And he strewed his wealth with such lavish hand
His rakish ways were the talk of the land
 And gossipers wise
 Sat winking their eyes
A certain foreboding of fresh surprise

A fast young man was Philiper Flash
And wore loud clothes and a weak mustache
 And done the Park
 For an afternoon lark
With a very fast horse of remarkable dash
And Philiper handled a billiardcue
About as well as the best he knew
 And used to say
 He could make it pay
By playing two or three games a day

And Philiper Flash was his mothers joy
He seemed to her the magic alloy
 That made her glad
 When her heart was sad
With the thought that she lived for her darling boy
His dear good mother wasnt aware
How her darling boy relished a tare
 She said one night
 He gave her a fright
By coming home late and ACTING tight

Young Philiper Flash on a winterish day
Was published a bankrupt so they say
 And as far as I know
 I suppose it was so
For matters went on in a singular way
His excellent mother I think I was told
Died from exposure and want and cold
 And Philiper Flash
 With a horrible slash
Whacked his jugular open and went to smash



THE SAME OLD STORY

The same old story told again
 The maiden droops her head
The ripening glow of her crimson cheek
 Is answering in her stead
The pleading tone of a trembling voice
 Is telling her the way
He loved her when his heart was young
 In Youths sunshiny day
The trembling tongue the longing tone
 Imploringly ask why
They can not be as happy now
 As in the days gone by
And two more hearts tumultuous
 With overflowing joy
Are dancing to the music
 Which that dear provoking boy
Is twanging on his bowstring
 As fluttering his wings
He sends his lovecharged arrows
 While merrily be sings
Ho ho my dainty maiden
 It surely can not be
You are thinking you are master
 Of your heart when it is me
And another gleaming arrow
 Does the little gods behest
And the dainty little maiden
 Falls upon her lovers breast
The same old story told again
 And listened oer and oer
Will still be new and pleasing too
 Till Time shall be no more



TO A BOY WHISTLING

The smiling face of a happy boy
 With its enchanted key
 Is now unlocking in memory
My store of heartiest joy

And my lost life again today
 In pleasant colors all aglow
 From rainbow tints to pure white snow
Is a panorama sliding away

The whistled air of a simple tune
 Eddies and whirls my thoughts around
 As fairy balloons of thistledown
Sail through the air of June

O happy boy with untaught grace
 What is there in the world to give
 That can buy one hour of the life you live
Or the trivial cause of your smiling face



AN OLD FRIEND

Hey Old Midsummer are you here again
 With all your harveststore of olden joys
Vast overhanging meadowlands of rain
And drowsy dawns and noons when golden grain
 Nods in the sun and lazy truant boys
Drift ever listlessly adown the day
Too full of joy to rest and dreams to play

The same old Summer with the same old smile
 Beaming upon us in the same old way
We knew in childhood Though a weary while
Since that far time yet memories reconcile
 The heart with odorous breaths of clover hay
And again I hear the doves and the sun streams through
The old barn door just as it used to do

And so it seems like welcoming a friend
 An old OLD friend upon his coming home
From some far countrycoming home to spend
Long loitering days with me And I extend
 My hand in rapturous gleeAnd so youve come
Ho Im so glad Come in and take a chair
Well this is just like OLD times I declare



WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING

There wasnt two purtier farms in the state
Than the couple of which Im about to relate
Jinin each otherbelongin to Brown
And jest at the edge of a flourishin town
Brown was a man as I understand
That allus had handled a good eal o land
And was sharp as a tack in drivin a trade
For thats the way most of his money was made
And all the grounds and the orchards about
His two pet farms was all tricked out
With poppies and posies
And sweetsmellin rosies
And hundreds o kinds
Of all sorts o vines
To tickle the most horticultural minds
And little dwarf trees not as thick as your wrist
With ripe apples on em as big as your fist
And peachesSiberian crabs and pears
And quincesWell ANY fruit ANY tree bears
And th purtiest streamjest aswimmin with fish
AndJEST OMOST EVERYTHING HEART COULD WISH
The purtiest orchrdsI wish you could see
How purty they was fer I know it ud be
A regular treatbut Ill go ahead with
My story A man by the name o Smith
A bad name to rhyme
But I reckon that Im
Not goin back on a Smith nary time
At hadnt a soul of kin nor kith
And more money than he knowed what to do with
So he comes aridin along one day
And HE says to Brown in his offhand way
Who was trainin some newfangled vines round a bay
WinderHowdydolookaheresay
Whatll you take fer this property here
Im talkin o leavin the city this year
And I want to be
Where the air is free
And Ill BUY this place if it aint too dear
Wellthey grumbled and jawed aroun
I dont like to part with the place says Brown
Well says Smith ajerkin his head
That house yonderbricks painted red
Jest like thisna PURTIER VIEW
Who is it owns it Thats mine too
Says Brown as he winked at a hole in his shoe
But Ill tell you right here jest what I KIN do
If youll pay the figgers Ill sell IT to you
Smith went over and looked at the place
Badgered with Brown and argied the case
Thought that Browns figgers was rather too tall
But findin that Brown wasnt goin to fall
In final agreed
So they drawed up the deed
Fer the farm and the fixturesthe live stock an all
And so Smith moved from the city as soon
As he possibly couldBut the man in the moon
Knowed moren Smith o farmin pursuits
And jest to convince you and have no disputes
How little he knowed
Ill tell you his mode
As he called it o raisin the best that growed
In the way o potatoes
Cucumberstomatoes
And squashes as lengthy as young alligators
Twas allus a curious thing to me
How big a fool a feller kin be
When he gits on a farm after leavin a town
Expectin to raise himself up to renown
And reap fer himself agricultural fame
By growin of squashesWITHOUT ANY SHAME
As useless and long as a technical name
To make the soil pure
And certainly sure
He plastered the ground with patent manure
He had cultivators and doublehoss plows
And patent machines fer milkin his cows
And patent hayforkspatent measures and weights
And new patent backaction hinges fer gates
And barn locks and latches and such little dribs
And patents to keep the rats out o the cribs
Reapers and mowers
And patent grain sowers
And drillers
And tillers
And cucumber hillers
And horriesand had patent rollers and scrapers
And took about ten agricultural papers
So you can imagine how matters turned out
But BROWN didnt have not a shadder o doubt
That Smith didnt know what he was about
When he said that the OLD way to farm was played out
But Smith worked ahead
And when any one said
That the OLD way o workin was better instead
O his modern idees he allus turned red
And wanted to know
What made people so
INFERNALLY anxious to hear theirselves crow
And guessed that hed manage to hoe his own row
Brown he come onct and leant over the fence
And told Smith that he couldnt see any sense
In goin to such a tremendous expense
Fer the sake o such noaccount experiments
Thatll never make corn
As shores youre born
Itll come out the leetlest end of the horn
Says Brown as he pulled off a big roastinear
From a stalk of his own
That had tribble outgrown
Smiths poor yaller shoots and says he Looky here
THIS corn was raised in the oldfashioned way
And I rather imagine that THIS cornll pay
Expenses fer RAISIN itWhat do you say
Brown got him then to look over his crop
HIS luck that season had been tiptop
And you may surmise
Smith opened his eyes
And let out a look o the wildest surprise
When Brown showed him punkins as big as the lies
He was stuffin him withabout offers hes had
Fer his farm I dont want to sell very bad
He says but says he
Mr Smith you kin see
Fer yourself how matters is standin with me
I UNDERSTAND FARMIN and Id better stay
You know on my farmIm amakin it pay
I oughtnt to grumbleI reckon Ill clear
Away over four thousand dollars this year
And that was the reason he made it appear
Why he didnt care about sellin his farm
And hinted at his havin done himself harm
In sellin the other and wanted to know
If Smith wouldnt sell back agin to himSo
Smith took the bait and says he Mr Brown
I wouldnt SELL out but we might swap aroun
Howll you trade your place fer mine
Purty sharp way o comin the shine
Over Smith Wasnt it Well sir this Brown
Played out his hand and brought Smithy down
Traded with him an workin it cute
Raked in two thousand dollars to boot
As slick as a whistle an that wasnt all
He managed to trade back agin the next fall
And the nextand the nextas long as Smith stayed
He reaped with his harvests an annual trade
Why I reckon that Brown must a easily made
On an AVERAGEnearly two thousand a year
Together he made over seven thousandclear
Till Mr Smith found he was losin his health
In as big a proportion almost as his wealth
So at last he concluded to move back to town
And sold back his farm to this same Mr Brown
At very low figgers by gittin it down
Furthern this I have nothin to say
Than merely advisin the Smiths fer to stay
In their grocery stores in flourishin towns
And leave agriculture aloneand the Browns



 A POETS WOOING

 I wood a woman once
But she was sharper than an eastern wind
 TENNYSON

What may I do to make you glad
To make you glad and free
 Till your light smiles glance
 And your bright eyes dance
Like sunbeams on the sea
 Read some rhyme that is blithe and gay
 Of a bright May morn and a marriage day
And she sighed in a listless way she had
Do not readit will make me sad

What shall I do to make you glad
To make you glad and gay
 Till your eyes gleam bright
 As the stars at night
When as light as the light of day
 Sing some song as I twang the strings
 Of my sweet guitar through its wanderings
And she sighed in the weary way she had
Do not singit will make me sad

What can I do to make you glad
As glad as glad can be
 Till your clear eyes seem
 Like the rays that gleam
And glint through a dewdecked tree
 Will it please you dear that I now begin
 A grand old air on my violin
And she spoke again in the following way
 Yes oh yes it would please me sir
I would be so glad youd play
 Some grand old marchin character
And then as you march away
I will no longer thus be sad
But oh so gladso gladso glad



MANS DEVOTION

A lover said O Maiden love me well
For I must go away
And should ANOTHER ever come to tell
Of loveWhat WILL you say

And she let fall a royal robe of hair
That folded on his arm
And made a golden pillow for her there
Her faceas bright a charm

As ever setting held in kingly crown
Made answer with a look
And reading it the lover bended down
And trusting kissed the book

He took a fond farewell and went away
And slow the time went by
So wearydreary was it day by day
To love and wait and sigh

She kissed his pictured face sometimes and said
 O Lips so cold and dumb
I would that you would tell me if not dead
 Why why do you not come

The picture smiling stared her in the face
 Unmovedeen with the touch
Of teardropsHERSbejeweling the case
 Twas plainshe loved him much

And thus she grew to think of him as gay
 And joyous all the while
And SHE was sorrowingAh welladay
 But pictures ALWAYS smile

And yearsdull yearsin dull monotony
 As ever went and came
Still weaving changes on unceasingly
 And changing changed her name

Was she untrueShe oftentimes was glad
 And happy as a wife
But ONE remembrance oftentimes made sad
 Her matrimonial life

Though its few years were hardly noted when
 Again her path was strown
With thornsthe roses swept away again
 And she again alone

And thenalas ah THENher lover came
 I come to claim you now
My Darling for I know you are the same
 And I have kept my vow

Through these long long long years and now no more
 Shall we asundered be
She staggered back and sinking to the floor
 Cried in her agony

I have been false she moaned _I_ am not true
 I am not worthy now
Nor ever can I be a wife to YOU
 For I have broke my vow

And as she kneeled there sobbing at his feet
 He calmly spokeno sign
Betrayed his inward agonyI count you meet
 To be a wife of mine

And raised her up forgiven though untrue
 As fond he gazed on her
She sighedSO HAPPY And she never knew
 HE was a WIDOWER



A BALLAD

WITH A SERIOUS CONCLUSION

Crowd about me little children
 Come and cluster round my knee
While I tell a little story
 That happened once with me

My father he had gone away
 Asailing on the foam
Leaving methe merest infant
 And my mother dear at home

For my father was a sailor
 And he sailed the ocean oer
For full five years ere yet again
 He reached his native shore

And I had grown up rugged
 And healthy day by day
Though I was but a puny babe
 When father went away

Poor mother she would kiss me
 And look at me and sigh
So strangely oft I wondered
 And would ask the reason why

And she would answer sadly
 Between her sobs and tears
You look so like your father
 Far away so many years

And then she would caress me
 And brush my hair away
And tell me not to question
 But to run about my play

Thus I went playing thoughtfully
 For that my mother said
YOU LOOK SO LIKE YOUR FATHER
 Kept ringing in my head

So ranging once the golden sands
 That looked out on the sea
I called aloud My father dear
 Come back to ma and me

Then I saw a glancing shadow
 On the sand and heard the shriek
Of a seagull flying seaward
 And I heard a gruff voice speak

Ay ay my little shipmate
 I thought I heard you hail
Were you trumpeting that seagull
 Or do you see a sail

And as rough and gruff a sailor
 As ever sailed the sea
Was standing near grotesquely
 And leering dreadfully

I replied though I was frightened
 It was my father dear
I was calling for across the sea
 I think he didnt hear

And then the sailor leered again
 In such a frightful way
And made so many faces
 I was little loath to stay

But he started fiercely toward me
 Then made a sudden halt
And roared _I_ think he heard you
 And turned a somersault

Then a wild fear overcame me
 And I flew off like the wind
Shrieking MOTHERand the sailor
 Just a little way behind

And then my mother heard me
 And I saw her shade her eyes
Looking toward me from the doorway
 Transfixed with pale surprise

For a momentthen her features
 Glowed with all their wonted charms
As the sailor overtook me
 And I fainted in her arms

When I awoke to reason
 I shuddered with affright
Till I felt my mothers presence
 With a thrill of wild delight

Till amid a shower of kisses
 Falling glad as summer rain
A muffled thunder rumbled
 Is he coming round again

Then I shrieked and clung unto her
 While her features flushed and burned
As she told me it was father
 From a foreign land returned

      

I saidwhen I was calm again
 And thoughtfully once more
Had dwelt upon my mothers words
 Of just the day before

I DONT look like my father
 As you told me yesterday
I know I dontor father
 Would have run the other way




THE OLD TIMES WERE THE BEST

Friends my heart is half aweary
 Of its happiness tonight
Though your songs are gay and cheery
 And your spirits featherlight
Theres a ghostly music haunting
 Still the heart of every guest
And a voiceless chorus chanting
 That the Old Times were the best


 CHORUS

All about is bright and pleasant
 With the sound of song and jest
Yet a feelings ever present
 That the Old Times were the best



A SUMMER AFTERNOON

A languid atmosphere a lazy breeze
 With labored respiration moves the wheat
From distant reaches till the golden seas
 Break in crisp whispers at my feet

My book neglected of an idle mind
 Hides for a moment from the eyes of men
Or lightly opened by a critic wind
 Affrightedly reviews itself again

Off through the haze that dances in the shine
 The warm sun showers in the open glade
The forest lies a silhouette design
 Dimmed through and through with shade

A dreamy day and tranquilly I lie
 At anchor from all storms of mental strain
With absent vision gazing at the sky
 Like one that hears it rain

The Katydid so boisterous last night
 Clinging inverted in uneasy poise
Beneath a wheatblade has forgotten quite
 If Katy DID or DIDNT make a noise

The twitter sometimes of a wayward bird
 That checks the song abruptly at the sound
And mildly chiding echoes that have stirred
 Sink into silence all the more profound

And drowsily I hear the plaintive strain
 Of some poor dove    Why I can scarcely keep
My heavy eyelidsthere it is again
 CoocooI mustntCoocoofall asleep



AT LAST

A dark tempestuous night the stars shut in
 With shrouds of fog an inky jetblack blot
The firmament and where the moon has been
 An hour agone seems like the darkest spot
The weird windfurious at its demon game
Rattles ones fancy like a windowframe

A careworn face peers out into the dark
 And childish facesfrightened at the gloom
Grow awed and vacant as they turn to mark
 The fathers as he passes through the room
The gate latch clatters and wee baby Bess
Whispers The doctors tummin now I dess

The father turns a sharp swift flash of pain
 Flits oer his face Amanda child I said
A moment sinceI see I must AGAIN
 Go take your little sisters off to bed
There Effie Rose and CLARA MUSTNT CRY
I tant hep itIm fyaid at mamall die

What are his feelings when this man alone
 Sits in the silence glaring in the grate
That sobs and sighs on in an undertone
 As stoicalimmovable as Fate
While muffled voices from the sick ones room
Come in like heralds of a dreaded doom

The doorlatch jingles in the doorway stands
 The doctor while the draft puffs in a breath
The dead coals leap to life and clap their hands
 The flames flash up A face as pale as death
Turns slowlyteeth tight clenched and with a look
The doctor through his specs reads like a book

Come brace up MajorLet me know the worst
 Wy youre the biggest fool I ever saw
Here Majortake a little brandy first
 There Shes a BOYI mean HE ishurrah
Wake up the other girlsand shout for joy
Eureka is his nameIve found A BOY



FARMER WHIPPLEBACHELOR

Its a mystery to see mea man o fiftyfour
Whos lived a cross old bachelor fer thirty year and more
Alookin glad and smilin And theys none o you can say
That you can guess the reason why I feel so good today

I must tell you all about it But Ill have to deviate
A little in beginnin sos to set the matter straight
As to how it comes to happen that I never took a wife
Kindo crawfish from the Present to the Springtime of my life

I was brought up in the country Of a family of five
Three brothers and a sisterIm the only one alive
Fer they all died little babies and twas one o Mothers ways
You know to want a daughter so she took a girl to raise

The sweetest little thing she was with rosy cheeks and fat
We was little chunks o shavers then about as high as that
But someway we sort a SUITEDlike and Mother shed declare
She never laid her eyes on a more lovin pair

Than WE was So we growed up side by side fer thirteen year
And every hour of it she growed to me more dear
Wy even Fathers dyin as he did I do believe
Warnt more affectin to me than it was to see her grieve

I was then a lad o twenty and I felt a flash o pride
In thinkin all depended on ME now to pervide
Fer Mother and fer Mary and I went about the place
With sleeves rolled upand workin with a mighty smilin
face

Fer SOMEPIN ELSE was workin but not a word I said
Of a certain sort o notion that was runnin through my head
Some day Id maybe marry and a BROTHERS love was one
Thinga LOVERS was another was the way the notion run

I remember onct in harvest when the cradlein  was done
When the harvest of my summers mounted up to twentyone
I was ridin home with Mary at the closin o the day
Achawin straws and thinkin in a lovers lazy way

And Marys cheeks was burnin like the sunset down the lane
I noticed she was thinkin too and ast her to explain
Wellwhen she turned and KISSED ME WITH HER ARMS AROUND
MELAW
Id a bigger load o Heaven than I had a load o straw

I dont ptend to learnin but Ill tell you whats a fac
Theys a mighty truthful sayin somers in a almanac
Er SOMERSbout puore happinessperhaps some folksll laugh
At the idyonly lastin jest two seconds and a half

But its jest as true as preachinfer that was a SISTERS
kiss
And a sisters lovin confidence atellin to me this
SHE was happy BEIN PROMISED TO THE SON O FARMER BROWN
And my feelins struck a pardnership with sunset and went down

I dont know HOW I acted and I dont know WHAT I said
Fer my heart seemed jest aturnin to an icecold lump o lead
And the hosses kind oglimmered before me in the road
And the lines fell from my fingersAnd that was all I knowed

Ferwell I dont know HOW longTheys a dim rememberence
Of a sound o snortin horses and a stakeandridered fence
Awhizzin past and wheatsheaves adancin in the air
And Mary screamin Murder and arunnin up to where

_I_ was layin by the roadside and the wagon upside down
Aleanin on the gatepost with the wheels awhirlin roun
And I tried to raise and meet her but I couldnt with a vague
Sort o notion comin to me that I had a broken leg

Well the women nussed me through it but many a time Id sigh
As Id keep agittin better instid o goin to die
And wonder what was left ME worth livin fer below
When the girl I loved was married to another dont you know

And my thoughts was as rebellious as the folks was good and kind
When Brown and Mary marriedRailly must a been my MIND
Was kind o out o kilterfer I hated Brown you see
Worsen PIZENand the feller whittled crutches out fer ME

And done a thousand little acs o kindness and respec
And me awishin all the time that I could break his neck
My relief was like a mourners when the funeral is done
When they moved to Illinois in the Fall o Fortyone

Then I went to work in airnestI had nothin much in view
But to drownd out rickollectionsand it kep me busy too
But I slowly thrived and prospered tel Mother used to say
She expected yit to see me a wealthy man some day

Then Id think how little MONEY was compared to happiness
And whod be left to use it when I died I couldnt guess
But Ive still kep speculatin and againin year by year
Tel Im payin half the taxes in the county mighty near

WellA year ago er better a letter comes to hand
Astin how Id like to dicker fer some Illinois land
The feller that had owned it it went ahead to state
Had jest deceased insolvent leavin chance to speculate

And then it closed by sayin that Id better come and see
Id never been West anyhowamost too wild fer ME
Id allus had a notion but a lawyer here in town
Said Id find myself mistakend when I come to look around

So I bids goodby to Mother and I jumps aboard the train
Athinkin what Id bring her when I come back home again
And ef shed had an idy what the present was to be
I think its moren likely shed a went along with me

Cars is awful tejus ridin fer all they go so fast
But finally they called out my stoppinplace at last
And that night at the tavern I dreamp I was a train
O cars and SKEERED at somepin runnin down a country lane

Well in the morning airlyafter huntin up the man
The lawyer who was wantin to swap the piece o land
We started fer the country and I ast the history
Of the farmits former ownerand so forth etcetery

Andwellit was interESTinI suprised him I suppose
By the loud and frequent manner in which I blowed my nose
But his suprise was greater and it made him wonder more
When I kissed and hugged the widder when she met us at the
door

IT WAS MARY    Theys a feelin ahidin down in here
Of course I cant explain it ner ever make it clear
It was with us in that meetin I dont want you to fergit
And it makes me kind onervous when I think about it yit

I BOUGHT that farm and DEEDED it afore I left the town
With title clear to mansions in the skies to Mary Brown
And futhermore I took her and the CHILDERNfer you see
Theyd never seed their Grandmaand I fetched em home with me

So NOW youve got an idy why a man o fiftyfour
Whos lived a cross old bachelor fer thirty year and more
Is alookin glad and smilinAnd Ive jest come into town
To git a pair o license fer to MARRY Mary Brown



MY JOLLY FRIENDS SECRET

Ah friend of mine how goes it
 Since youve taken you a mate
Your smile though plainly shows it
 Is a very happy state
Dan Cupids necromancy
 You must sit you down and dine
And lubricate your fancy
 With a glass or two of wine

And as you have deserted
 As my other chums have done
While I laugh alone diverted
 As you drop off one by one
And Ive remained unwedded
 Tillyou seelook herethat Im
In a manner snatched baldheaded
 By the sportive hand of Time

Im an old un yes but wrinkles
 Are not so plenty quite
As to cover up the twinkles
 Of the BOYaint I right
Yet there are ghosts of kisses
 Under this mustache of mine
My memry only misses
 When I drown em out with wine

From acknowledgment so ample
 You would hardly take me for
What I ama perfect sample
 Of a jolly bachelor
Not a bachelor has being
 When he laughs at married life
But his heart and souls agreeing
 That he ought to have a wife

Ah ha I old chum this claret
 Like Fatima holds the key
Of the old BlueBeardish garret
 Of my hidden mystery
Did you say youd like to listen
 Ah my boy the SAD NO MORE
And the teardrops that will glisten
 TURN THE CATCH UPON THE DOOR

And sit you down beside me
 And put yourself at ease
Ill trouble you to slide me
 That wine decanter please
The path is kind o mazy
 Where my fancies have to go
And my heart gets sort o lazy
 On the journeydont you know

Let me seewhen I was twenty
 Its a lordly age my boy
When a fellows moneys plenty
 And the leisure to enjoy
And a girlwith hair as golden
 AsTHAT and lipswellquite
As red as THIS Im holdin
 Between you and the light

And eyes and a complexion
 Ah heavenslemesee
Welljust in this connection
 DID YOU LOCK THAT DOOR FOR ME
Did I start in recitation
 My past life to recall
Well THATS an indication
 I am purty tightthats all



THE SPEEDING OF THE KINGS SPITE

A kingestranged from his loving Queen
 By a foolish royal whim
Tired and sick of the dull routine
 Of matters surrounding him
Issued a mandate in this wise
 THE DOWER OF MY DAUGHTERS HAND
I WILL GIVE TO HIM WHO HOLDS THIS PRIZE
 THE STRANGEST THING IN THE LAND

But the King sad sooth in this grim decree
 Had a motive low and mean
Twas a royal piece of chicanery
 To harry and spite the Queen
For King though he was and beyond compare
 He had ruled all things save one
Then blamed the Queen that his only heir
 Was a daughternot a son

The girl had grown in the mothers care
 Like a bud in the shine and shower
That drinks of the wine of the balmy air
 Till it blooms into matchless flower
Her waist was the roses stem that bore
 The flowerand the flowers perfume
That ripens on till it bulges oer
 With its wealth of bud and bloom

And she had a loverlowly sprung
 But a purer nobler heart
Never spake in a courtlier tongue
 Or wooed with a dearer art
And the fair pair paled at the Kings decree
 But the smiling Fates contrived
To have them wed in a secrecy
 That the Queen HERSELF connived

While the grim Kings heralds scoured the land
 And the countries roundabout
Shouting aloud at the Kings command
 A challenge to knave or lout
Prince or peasantThe mighty King
 Would have ye understand
That he who shows him the strangest thing
 Shall have his daughters hand

And thousands flocked to the royal throne
 Bringing a thousand things
Strange and curiousOne a bone
 The hinge of a fairys wings
And one the glass of a mermaid queen
 Gemmed with a diamond dew
Where down in its reflex dimly seen
 Her face smiled out at you

One brought a cluster of some strange date
 With a subtle and searching tang
That seemed as you tasted to penetrate
 The heart like a serpents fang
And back you fell for a spell entranced
 As cold as a corpse of stone
And heard your brains as they laughed and danced
 And talked in an undertone

One brought a bird that could whistle a tune
 So piercingly pure and sweet
That tears would fall from the eyes of the moon
 In dewdrops at its feet
And the winds would sigh at the sweet refrain
 Till they swooned in an ecstacy
To waken again in a hurricane
 Of riot and jubilee

One brought a lute that was wrought of a shell
 Luminous as the shine
Of a newborn star in a dewy dell
 And its strings were strands of wine
That sprayed at the Fancys touch and fused
 As your listening spirit leant
Drunken through with the airs that oozed
 From the oersweet instrument

One brought a tablet of ivory
 Whereon no thing was writ
But at nightand the dazzled eyes would see
 Flickering lines oer it
And each as you read from the magic tome
 Lightened and died in flame
And the memory held but a golden poem
 Too beautiful to name

Till it seemed all marvels that ever were known
 Or dreamed of under the sun
Were brought and displayed at the royal throne
 And put by one by one
Till a graybeard monster came to the King
 Haggard and wrinkled and old
And spread to his gaze this wondrous thing
 A gossamer veil of gold

Strangely marvelousmocking the gaze
 Like a tangle of bright sunshine
Dipping a million glittering rays
 In a baptism divine
And a maiden sheened in this gauze attire
 Sifting a glance of her eye
Dazzled mens souls with a fierce desire
 To kiss and caress her anddie

And the grim King swore by his royal beard
 That the veil had won the prize
While the gray old monster blinked and leered
 With his lashless redrimmed eyes
As the fainting form of the princess fell
 And the mothers heart went wild
Throbbing and swelling a muffled knell
 For the dead hopes of her child

But her clouded face with a faint smile shone
 As suddenly through the throng
Pushing his way to the royal throne
 A fair youth strode along
While a strange smile hovered about his eyes
 As he said to the grim old King
The veil of gold must lose the prize
 For _I_ have a stranger thing

He bent and whispered a sentence brief
 But the monarch shook his head
With a look expressive of unbelief
 It cant be so he said
Or give me proof and I the King
 Give you my daughters hand
For certes THAT IS a stranger thing
 THE STRANGEST THING IN THE LAND

Then the fair youth turning caught the Queen
 In a rapturous caress
While his lithe form towered in lordly mien
 As he said in a brief address
My fair brides mother is this and lo
 As you stare in your royal awe
By this pure kiss do I proudly show
 A LOVE FOR A MOTHERINLAW

Then a thaw set in the old Kings mood
 And a sweet Spring freshet came
Into his eyes and his heart renewed
 Its love for the favored dame
But often he has been heard to declare
 That he never could clearly see
How in the deuce such a strange affair
 Could have ended so happily


JOB WORK

Write me a rhyme of the present time
 And the poet took his pen
And wrote such lines as the miser minds
 Hide in the hearts of men

He grew enthused as the poets used
 When their fingers kissed the strings
Of some sweet lyre and caught the fire
 True inspiration brings

And sang the song of a nations wrong
 Of the patriots galling chain
And the glad release that the angel Peace
 Has given him again

He sang the lay of religions sway
 Where a hundred creeds clasp hands
And shout in glee such a symphony
 That the whole world understands

He struck the key of monopoly
 And sang of her swift decay
And traveled the track of the railway back
 With a blithesome roundelay

Of the tranquil bliss of a true love kiss
 And painted the picture too
Of the wedded life and the patient wife
 And the husband fond and true

And sang the joy that a noble boy
 Brings to a fathers soul
Who lets the wine as a mocker shine
 Stagnated in the bowl

And he stabbed his pen in the ink again
 And wrote with a writhing frown
This is the end And now my friend
 You may print itupside down


PRIVATE THEATRICALS

A quite convincing axiom
 Is Life is like a play
For turning back its pages some
 Few dogeared years away
 I find where I
 Committed my
Lovetalewith brackets where to sigh

I feel an idle interest
 To read again the page
I enter as a lover dressed
 At twenty years of age
 And play the part
 With throbbing heart
And all an actors glowing art

And she who plays my Ladylove
 ExcelsHer loving glance
Has power her audience to move
 I am her audience
 Her acting tact
 To tell the fact
Brings down the house in every act

And often we defy the curse
 Of storms and thundershowers
To meet together and rehearse
 This little play of ours
 I think when she
 Makes love to me
She kisses very naturally

      

Yes its convincingrather
 That Life is like a play
I am playing Heavy Father
 In a Screaming Farce today
 That so brings down
 The house I frown
And fain would ring the curtain down


PLAIN SERMONS

I saw a manand envied him beside
 Because of this worlds goods he had great store
But even as I envied him he died
 And left me envious of him no more

I saw another manand envied still
 Because he was content with frugal lot
But as I envied him the rich mans will
 Bequeathed him all and envy I forgot

Yet still another man I saw and he
 I envied for a calm and tranquil mind
That nothing fretted in the least degree
 Until alas I found that he was blind

What vanity is envy for I find
 I have been rich in dross of thought and poor
In that I was a fool and lastly blind
 For never having seen myself before


TRADIN JOE

Im one o these curous kind o chaps
You think you know when you dont perhaps
I haint no foolner I dont ptend
To be so smart I could rickommend

But some way o nother the longer we wait
The harder it is to discover a mate

Marshall Thomasa friend o mine

And I greeced my boots and combed my hair
Keerfully over the bald place there
And Marshall Thomas and me that day
Eat our dinners with Widder Gray
And her girl Han   


 Well jest a glance
O the widders smilin countenance
Acuttin up chicken and big potpies
Would make a man hungry in Paradise
And passin pserves and jelly and cake
At would make an ANGELS appetite ACHE
Pourin out coffee as yaller as gold
Twict as much as the cup could hold
La it was richAnd then shed say
Take some o THIS in her coaxin way

And jest dropped dead on her whiteoak floor

Well the way I talked would a done you good

Was anoticin me in a curous way
So I says to mysef says I Now Joe

And I simmered down and let them do
The bulk o the talkin the evening through

And Marshall was still in a talkative gait
When he left that eveningtolable late
How do you like her he says to me
Says I She suits to a TYTEE
And then I ast how matters stood
With him in the OPPOSITE neighberhood
Bully he says I ruther guess

Kind o smiled and said SHED SEE

Yes says I youre ahead o ME
And then he laughed and said GO IN
And patted me on the shoulder agin

Well ever sense then Ive been ridin a good
Deal through the Kankakee neighberhood
And I make it convenient sometimes to stop
And hitch a few minutes and kind o drop
In at the widders and talk o the crop
And one thing o nother And week afore last
The notion struck me as I drove past
Id stop at the place and state my case
Might as well do it at first as last

I felt firstrate so I hitched at the gate
And went up to the house and strange to relate
MARSHALL THOMAS had dropped in TOO
Glad to see you sir how do you do

Says I Whats up And she says says she

Well somepin o nother in that girls voice
Says to me Joseph heres your choice
And another minute her guileless breast
Was lovinly throbbin agin my vest
And then I kissed her and heerd a smack
Come like a echo aflutterin back
And we looked around and in full view
Marshall was kissin the widder too
Well we all of us laughed in our glad suprise
Tel the tears come ASTREAMIN out of our eyes
And when Marsh said Twas the squarest trade
That ever me and him had made
We both shuck hands y jucks and swore

And old Squire Chipman tuck us the trip
And Marshall and mes in pardnership

I SMOKE MY PIPE

I cant extend to every friend
 In need a helping hand
No matter though I wish it so
 Tis not as Fortune planned
But haply may I fancy they
 Are men of different stripe
Than others think who hint and wink
 And soI smoke my pipe

A golden coal to crown the bowl
 My pipe and I alone
I sit and muse with idler views
 Perchance than I should own
It might be worse to own the purse
 Whose glutted bowels gripe
In little qualms of stinted alms
 And so I smoke my pipe

And if inclined to moor my mind
 And cast the anchor Hope
A puff of breath will put to death
 The morbid misanthrope
That lurks insideas errors hide
 In standing forms of type
To mar at birth some line of worth
 And so I smoke my pipe

The subtle stings misfortune flings
 Can give me little pain
When my narcotic spell has wrought
 This quiet in my brain
When I can waste the past in taste
 So luscious and so ripe
That like an elf I hug myself
 And so I smoke my pipe

And wrapped in shrouds of drifting clouds
 I watch the phantoms flight
Till alien eyes from Paradise
 Smile on me as I write
And I forgive the wrongs that live
 As lightly as I wipe
Away the tear that rises here
 And so I smoke my pipe



RED RIDINGHOOD

Sweet little myth of the nursery story
 Earliest love of mine infantile breast
Be something tangible bloom in thy glory
 Into existence as thou art addressed
Hasten appear to me guileless and good
 Thou are so dear to me Red RidingHood

Azureblue eyes in a marvel of wonder
 Over the dawn of a blush breaking out
Sensitive nose with a little smile under
 Trying to hide in a blossoming pout
Couldnt be serious try as you would
 Little mysterious Red RidingHood

Hah little girl it is desolate lonely
 Out in this gloomy old forest of Life
Here are not pansies and buttercups only
 Brambles and briers as keen as a knife
And a Heart ravenous trails in the wood
For the meal have he mustRed RidingHood


IF I KNEW WHAT POETS KNOW

If I knew what poets know
 Would I write a rhyme
Of the buds that never blow
 In the summertime
Would I sing of golden seeds
Springing up in ironweeds
And of raindrops turned to snow
If I knew what poets know

Did I know what poets do
 Would I sing a song
Sadder than the pigeons coo
 When the days are long
Where I found a heart in pain
I would make it glad again
And the false should be the true
Did I know what poets do

If I knew what poets know
 I would find a theme
Sweeter than the placid flow
 Of the fairest dream
I would sing of love that lives
On the errors it forgives
And the world would better grow
If I knew what poets know


AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE

An old sweetheart of mineIs this her presence here with me
Or but a vain creation of a lovers memory
A fair illusive vision that would vanish into air
Dared I even touch the silence with the whisper of a prayer

Nay let me then believe in all the blended false and true
The semblance of the OLD love and the substance of the NEW
The THEN of changeless sunny daysthe NOW of shower and shine
But Love forever smilingas that old sweetheart of mine

This everrestful sense of HOME though shouts ring in the
hall
The easy chairthe old bookshelves and prints along the wall
The rare HABANAS in their box or gaunt churchwardenstem
That often wags above the jar derisively at them

As one who cons at evening oer an album all alone
And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known
So I turn the leaves of Fancy till in shadowy design
I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine

The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise
As I turn it lowto rest me of the dazzle in my eyes
And light my pipe in silence save a sigh that seems to yoke
Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke

Tis a FRAGRANT retrospectionfor the loving thoughts that
start
Into being are like perfume from the blossom of the heart
And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine
When my truant fancies wander with that old sweetheart of mine

Though I hear beneath my study like a fluttering of wings
The voices of my children and the mother as she sings
I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me any theme
When Care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dream

In fact to speak in earnest I believe it adds a charm
To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm
For I find an extra flavor in Memorys mellow wine
That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine

O Childhooddays enchanted O the magic of the Spring
With all green boughs to blossom white and all bluebirds to
sing
When all the air to toss and quaff made life a jubilee
And changed the childrens song and laugh to shrieks of ecstasy

With eyes half closed in clouds that ooze from lips that taste
as well
The peppermint and cinnamon I hear the old School bell
And from Recess romp in again from Blackmans broken line
To smile behind my lesson at that old sweetheart of mine

A face of lilybeauty with a form of airy grace
Floats out of my tobacco as the Genii from the vase
And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes
As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies

I can see the pink sunbonnet and the little checkered dress
She wore when first I kissed her and she answered the caress
With the written declaration that as surely as the vine
Grew round the stump she loved methat old sweetheart of
mine

Again I made her presents in a really helpless way
The big Rhode Island GreeningI was hungry too that day
But I follow her from Spelling with her hand behind herso
And I slip the apple in itand the Teacher doesnt know

I give my TREASURES to herallmy pencilblueandred
And if little girls played marbles MINE should all be HERS
instead
But SHE gave me her PHOTOGRAPH and printed Ever Thine
Across the backin blueandredthat old sweetheart of mine

And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand
As we used to talk together of the future we had planned
When I should be a poet and with nothing else to do
But write the tender verses that she set the music to   

When we should live together in a cozy little cot
Hid in a nest of roses with a fairy gardenspot
Where the vines were ever fruited and the weather ever fine
And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine

When I should be her lover forever and a day
And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray
And we should be so happy that when eithers lips were dumb
They would not smile in Heaven till the others kiss had come

But ah my dream is broken by a step upon the stair
And the door is softly opened andmy wife is standing there
Yet with eagerness and rapture all my visions I resign
To greet the LIVING presence of that old sweetheart of mine


SQUIRE HAWKINSS STORY

I haint no hand at tellin tales
Er spinnin yarns as the sailors say
Someway o nother language fails
To slide fer me in the oily way
That LAWYERS has and I wisht it would
Fer Ive got somepin that I call good
But bein only a country squire
Ive learned to listen and admire
Ruther preferrin to be addressed
Than talk mysefbut Ill do my best

Old Jeff Thompsonwell Ill say
Was the clostest man I ever saw
Rich as cream but the porest pay
And the meanest man to work ferLa
Ive knowed that man to work one hand
Fer little er nothin you understand
From four oclock in the morning light
Tel eight and nine oclock at night
And then find fault with his appetite
Hed drive all over the neighberhood
To miss the place where a tollgate stood
And slip in town by some old road
That no two men in the county knowed
With a jag o wood and a sack o wheat
That wouldnt burn and you couldnt eat
And the trades hed make ll I jest declare
Was enough to make a preacher swear
And then hed hitch and hang about
Tel the lights in the tollgate was blowed out
And then the turnpike hed turn in
And sneak his way back home agin

Some folks hint and I make no doubt
That thats what wore his old wife out
Toilin away from day to day
And year to year through heat and cold
Uncomplaininthe same old way
The martyrs died in the days of old
And aclingin too as the martyrs done
To one fixed faith and her ONLY one
Little Patience the sweetest child
That ever wept unrickonciled
Er felt the pain and the ache and sting
That only a mothers death can bring

Patience ThompsonI think that name
Must a come from a power above
Fer it seemed to fit her jest the same
As a GAITER would er a fine kid glove
And to see that girl with all the care
Of the household on herI declare
It was OUDACIOUS the work shed do
And the thousand plans that shed putt through

And sing like a medderlark all day long
And drowned her cares in the joys o song
And LAUGH sometimes tel the farmers hand
Away fur off in the fields would stand
Alistenin with the plow half drawn
Tel the coaxin echoes called him on
And the furries seemed in his dreamy eyes
Like footpaths aleadin to Paradise
As off through the hazy atmosphere
The call fer dinner reached his ear

Now LOVES as cunnina little thing
As a humminbird upon the wing
And as liable to poke his nose
Jest where folks would least suppose
And moren likely build his nest
Right in the heart youd leave unguessed
And live and thrive at your expense
At least thats MY experience
And old Jeff Thompson often thought
In his sefish way that the quiet John
Was a stiddy chap as a farmhand OUGHT
To always befer the airliest dawn
Found John busyand EASY too
Whenever his wages would fall due
To sum him up with a final touch
He EAT so little and WORKED so much
That old Jeff laughed to hissef and said
He makes ME money and airns his bread

But John fer all of his quietude
Would sometimes drap a word er so
That none but PATIENCE understood
And none but her was MEANT to know
Maybe at mealtimes John would say
As the sugarbowl come down his way
Thanky no MY coffees sweet
Enough fer ME with sich conceit
SHED know at once without no doubt
HE meant because she poured it out
And smile and blush and all sich stuff
And ast ef it was STRONG enough
And git the answer neat and trim
It COULDNT be too strong fer HIM

And so things went fer bout a year
Tel John at last found pluck to go
And pour his tale in the old mans ear
And ef it had been HOT LEAD I know
It couldnt a raised a louder fuss
Ner a riled the old mans temper wuss
He jest LIT in and cussed and swore
And lunged and rared and ripped and tore
And told John jest to leave his door
And not to darken it no more
But Patience cried with eyes all wet
Remember John and dont ferget
WHATEVER comes I love you yet
But the old man thought in his sefish way
Ill see her married rich some day
And THAT thinks he is money fer ME
And my wills LAW as it ought to be

So when in the course of a month er so
A WIDOWER with a farm er two
Comes to Jeffs wy the folks you know
Had to TALKas the folksll do
It was the talk of the neighberhood
PATIENCE and JOHN and THEIR affairs
And this old chap with a few gray hairs
Had cut John out it was understood
And some folks reckoned Patience too
Knowed what SHE was agoin to do
It was LIKE herla indeed
All she loved was DOLLARS and CENTS
Like old JEFFand they saw no need
Fer JOHN to pine at HER negligence

But others said in a KINDER way
They missed the songs she used to sing
They missed the smiles that used to play
Over her face and the laughin ring
Of her glad voicethat EVERYthing
Of her OLD sef seemed dead and gone
And this was the ghost that they gazed on

Tel finally it was noised about
There was a WEDDIN soon to be
Down at Jeffs and the cat was out
Shore enoughLl the JEEMUNNEE
It RILED me when John told me so
Fer _I_ WAS A FRIEND O JOHNS you know
And his trimblin voice jest broke in two
As a fellers voicell sometimes do
And I says says I Ef I know my biz
And I think I know what JESTICE is
Ive read SOME lawand Id advise
A man like you to wipe his eyes
And square his jaws and start AGIN
FER JESTICE IS AGOIN TO WIN
And it wasnt long tel his eyes had cleared
As blue as the skies and the sun appeared
In the shape of a good oldfashioned smile
That I hadnt seen fer a long long while

So we talked on fer a hour er more
And sunned ourselves in the open door
Tel a hossandbuggy down the road
Come adrivin up that I guess John KNOWED
Fer he winked and says Ill dessappear
THEYD smell a mice ef they saw ME here
And he thumbed his nose at the old gray mare
And hid hissef in the house somewhere

WellThe rig drove up and I raised my head
As old Jeff hollered to me and said
That him and his old friend there had come
To see ef the squire was at home
   I told em I was and I AIMED to be
At every chance of a weddinfee
And then I laughedand they laughed too
Fer that was the object they had in view
Would I be on hands at eight that night
They ast and sI Youre mighty right
ILL be on hand And then I BUST
Out alaughin my very wust
And so did they as they wheeled away
And drove tords town in a cloud o dust
Then I shet the door and me and John
Laughed and LAUGHED and jest LAUGHED on
Tel Mother drapped her specs and BY
JEEWHILLIKERS I thought shed DIE
And she couldnt a told Ill bet my hat
What on earth she was laughin at

But all o the fun o the tale haint done
Fer a drizzlin rain had jest begun
And ahavin bout four mile to ride
I jest concluded Id better light
Out fer Jeffs and save my hide
Fer IT WAS AGOIN TO STORM THAT NIGHT
So we went down to the barn and John
Saddled my beast and I got on
And he told me somepin to not ferget
And when I left he was LAUGHIN yet

And proachin on to my journeys end
The great big draps o the rain come down
And the thunder growled in a way to lend
An awful look to the lowerin frown
The dull sky wore and the lightnin glanced
Tel my old mare jest MOREN pranced
And tossed her head and bugged her eyes
To about four times their natchurl size
As the big black lips of the clouds ud drap
Out some oath of a thunderclap
And threaten on in an undertone
That chilled a feller clean to the bone

But I struck shelter soon enough
To save mysef And the house was jammed
With the womenfolks and the weddinstuff
A great long table fairly CRAMMED
With big poundcakesand chops and steaks
And roasts and stewsand stumickaches
Of every fashion form and size
From twisters up to punkinpies
And candies oranges and figs
And reezinsall the whilligigs
And jimcracks that the law allows
On sich occasionsBobs and bows
Of gigglin girls with corkscrew curls
And fancy ribbons reds and blues
And beauketchers and curliques
To beat the world And seven oclock
Brought old Jeffand broughtTHE GROOM
With a sideboardcollar on and stock
That choked him so he hadnt room
To SWALLER in er even sneeze
Er clear his thoat with any case
Er comfortand a good square cough
Would saw his Adams apple off

But as fer PATIENCEMY OomhOOMH
I never saw her look so sweet
Her face was cream and roses too
And then them eyes o heavenly blue
Jest made an angel all complete
And when she split em up in smiles
And splintered em around the room
And danced acrost and met the groom
And LAUGHED OUT LOUDIt kind o spiles
My language when I come to that
Fer as she laid away his hat
Thinks I THE PAPERS HID INSIDE
OF THAT SAID HAT MUST MAKE A BRIDE
A HAPPY ONE FER ALL HER LIFE
Er else a WRECKED AND WRETCHED WIFE
And someway then I thought of JOHN
Then looked towards PATIENCE    She was GONE
The door stood open and the rain
Was dashin in and sharp and plain
Above the storm we heerd a cry
A ringin laughin loud Goodby
That died away as fleet and fast
A hosss hoofs went splashin past
And that was all Twas done that quick   
Youve heerd o fellers lookin sick
I wisht youd seen THE GROOM jest then
I wisht youd seen them two old men
With starin eyes that fairly GLARED
At one another and the scared
And empty faces of the crowd
I wisht you could a been allowed
To jest look on and see it all
And heerd the girls and women bawl
And wring their hands and heerd old Jeff
Acussin as he swung hissef
Upon his hoss who champed his bit
As though old Nick had holt of it
And cheek by jowl the two old wrecks
Rode off as though theyd break their necks

And as we all stood starin out
Into the night I felt the brush
Of some ones hand and turned about
And heerd a voice that whispered HUSH
THEYRE WAITIN IN THE KITCHEN AND
YOURE WANTED DONT YOU UNDERSTAND
Well ef my MEMORY serves me now
I think I winkedWell anyhow
I left the crowd agawkin there
And jest slipped off around to where
The back door opened and went in
And turned and shet the door agin
And maybe LOCKED itcouldnt swear
A womans arms around me makes
Me liable to make mistakes
I read a marriage license nex
But as I didnt have my specs
I jest INFERRED it was all right
And tied the knot so mortaltight
That Patience and my old friend John
Was safe enough from that time on

Well now I might go on and tell
How all the joke at last leaked out
And how the youngsters raised the yell
And rode the happy groom about
Upon their shoulders how the bride
Was kissed a hunderd times beside
The one _I_ give hertel she cried
And laughed untel she like to died
I might go on and tell you all
About the supperand the BALL
Youd ought to see me twist my heel
Through jest one old Furginny reel
Afore you die er tromp the strings
Of some old fiddle tel she sings
Some old cowtillion dont you know
That putts the devil in yer toe

We kep the dancin up tel FOUR
Oclock I reckonmaybe more
We hardly heerd the thunders roar
ER THOUGHT about the STORM that blowed
AND THEM TWO FELLERS ON THE ROAD
Tel all at onct we heerd the door
Bust open and a voice that SWORE
And old Jeff Thompson tuck the floor
He shuck hissef and looked around
Like some old dog about halfdrowned
HIS HAT I reckon WEIGHED TEN POUND
To say the least and Ill say SHORE
HIS OVERCOAT WEIGHED FIFTY more
THE WETTEST MAN YOU EVER SAW
TO HAVE SO DRY A SONINLAW

He sized it all and Patience laid
Her hand in Johns and looked afraid
And waited And a stiller set
O folks I KNOW you never met
In any court room where with dread
They wait to hear a verdick read

The old man turned his eyes on me
And have you married em says he
I nodded Yes Well thatll do
He says and now were though with YOU
YOU jest clear out and I decide
And promise to be satisfied
He hadnt nothin more to say
I saw of course how matters lay
And left But as I rode away
I heerd the roosters crow fer day


A COUNTRY PATHWAY

I come upon it suddenly alone
 A little pathway winding in the weeds
That fringe the roadside and with dreams my own
 I wander as it leads

Full wistfully along the slender way
 Through summer tan of freckled shade and shine
I take the path that leads me as it may
 Its every choice is mine

A chipmunk or a suddenwhirring quail
 Is startled by my step as on I fare
A gartersnake across the dusty trail
 Glances andis not there

Above the arching jimsonweeds flare twos
 And twos of sallowyellow butterflies
Like blooms of lorn primroses blowing loose
 When autumn winds arise

The trail dipsdwindlesbroadens then and lifts
 Itself astride a crossroad dubiously
And from the fennel marge beyond it drifts
 Still onward beckoning me

And though it needs must lure me mile on mile
 Out of the public highway still I go
My thoughts far in advance in Indian file
 Allure me even so

Why I am as a longlost boy that went
 At dusk to bring the cattle to the bars
And was not found again though Heaven lent
 His mother all the stars

With which to seek him through that awful night
 O years of nights as vainStars never rise
But well might miss their glitter in the light
 Of tears in mothereyes

Soon with quickened breaths I follow still
 My avantcourier must be obeyed
Thus am I led and thus the path at will
 Invites me to invade

A meadows precincts where my daring guide
 Clambers the steps of an oldfashioned stile
And stumbles down again the other side
 To gambol there a while

In pranks of hideandseek as on ahead
 I see it running while the cloverstalks
Shake rosy fists at me as though they said
 You dog our country walks

And mutilate us with your walkingstick
 We will not suffer tamely what you do
And warn you at your perilfor well sick
 Our bumblebees on you

But I smile back in airy nonchalance
 The more determined on my wayward quest
As some bright memory a moment dawns
 A morning in my breast

Sending a thrill that hurries me along
 In faulty similes of childish skips
Enthused with lithe contortions of a song
 Performing on my lips

In wild meanderings oer pasture wealth
 Erratic wanderings through deadning lands
Where sly old brambles plucking me by stealth
 Put berries in my hands

Or the path climbs a boulderwades a slough
 Or rollicking through buttercups and flags
Goes gaily dancing oer a deep bayou
 On old treetrunks and snags

Or at the creek leads oer a limpid pool
 Upon a bridge the stream itself has made
With some Springfreshet for the mighty tool
 That its foundation laid

I pause a moment here to bend and muse
 With dreamy eyes on my reflection where
A boatbacked bug drifts on a helpless cruise
 Or wildly oars the air

As dimly seen the pirate of the brook
 The pike whose jaunty hulk denotes his speed
Swings pivoting about with wary look
 Of low and cunning greed

Till filled with other thought I turn again
 To where the pathway enters in a realm
Of lordly woodland under sovereign reign
 Of towering oak and elm

A puritanic quiet here reviles
 The almost whispered warble from the hedge
And takes a locusts rasping voice and files
 The silence to an edge

In such a solitude my somber way
 Strays like a misanthrope within a gloom
Of his own shadowstill the perfect day
 Bursts into sudden bloom

And crowns a long declining stretch of space
 Where King Corns armies lie with flags unfurled
And where the valleys dint in Natures face
 Dimples a smiling world

And lo through mists that may not be dispelled
 I see an old farm homestead as in dreams
Where like a gem in costly setting held
 The old log cabin gleams

       

O darling Pathway lead me bravely on
 Adown your valleyway and run before
Among the roses crowding up the lawn
 And thronging at the door

And carry up the echo there that shall
 Arouse the drowsy dog that he may bay
The household out to greet the prodigal
 That wanders home today


THE OLD GUITAR

Neglected now is the old guitar
 And moldering into decay
Fretted with many a rift and scar
 That the dull dust hides away
While the spider spins a silver star
 In its silent lips today

The keys hold only nerveless strings
 The sinews of brave old airs
Are pulseless now and the scarf that clings
 So closely here declares
A sad regret in its ravelings
 And the faded hue it wears

But the old guitar with a lenient grace
 Has cherished a smile for me
And its features hint of a fairer face
 That comes with a memory
Of a flowerandperfumehaunted place
 And a moonlit balcony

Music sweeter than words confess
 Or the minstrels powers invent
Thrilled here once at the light caress
 Of the fairy hands that lent
This excuse for the kiss I press
 On the dear old instrument

The rose of pearl with the jeweled stem
 Still blooms and the tiny sets
In the circle all are here the gem
 In the keys and the silver frets
But the dainty fingers that danced oer them
 Alas for the hearts regrets

Alas for the loosened strings today
 And the wounds of rift and scar
On a worn old heart with its roundelay
 Enthralled with a stronger bar
That Fate weaves on through a dull decay
 Like that of the old guitar


FRIDAY AFTERNOON

TO WILLIAM MORRIS PIERSON

18681870

Of the wealth of facts and fancies
 That our memories may recall
The old schoolday romances
 Are the dearest after all
When some sweet thought revises
 The halfforgotten tune
That opened Exercises
 On Friday Afternoon

We seem to hear the clicking
 Of the pencil and the pen
And the solemn ceaseless ticking
 Of the timepiece ticking then
And we note the watchful master
 As he waves the warning rod
With our own heart beating faster
 Than the boys who threw the wad

Some little hand uplifted
 And the creaking of a shoe
A problem left unsifted
 For the teachers hand to do
The murmured hum of learning
 And the flutter of a book
The smell of something burning
 And the schools inquiring look

The bashful boy in blushes
 And the girl with glancing eyes
Who hides her smiles and hushes
 The laugh about to rise
Then with a quick invention
 Assumes a serious face
To meet the words Attention
 Every scholar in his place

The opening song page 20
 Ah dear old Golden Wreath
You willed your sweets in plenty
 And some who look beneath
The leaves of Time will linger
 And loving tears will start
As Fancy trails her finger
 Oer the index of the heart

Good News from HomeWe hear it
 Welling tremulous yet clear
And holy as the spirit
 Of the song we used to hear
Good news for me A throbbing
 And an aching melody
Has come across thesobbing
 Yea and salty dark blue sea

Or the paean Scotlands burning
 With its mighty surge and swell
Of chorus still returning
 To its universal yell
Till were almost glad to drop to
 Something sad and full of pain
And Skip verse three and stop too
 Ere our hearts are broke again

Then the big girls compositions
 With their doubt and hope and glow
Of heart and faceconditions
 Of the big boyseven so
When themes of Spring and Summer
 And of Fall and Wintertime
Droop our heads and hold us dumber
 Than the sleighbells fancied chime

Elocutionary science
 Still in changeless infancy
With its Catalines Defiance
 And The Banner of the Free
Or lured from Grandmas attic
 A ramshackle rocker there
Adds a skreek of the dramatic
 To the poets Old ArmChair

Or the Speech of Logan shifts us
 From the pathos to the fire
And Tell with Gessler lifts us
 Many noble notches higher
Till a youngster far from sunny
 With sad eyes of watery blue
Winds up with something funny
 Like Cockadoodledo

Then a dialogueselected
 For its realistic worth
The Cruel Boy detected
 With a turtle turned to earth
Back downward and in pleading
 The Good Boystrangely gay
At such a sad proceeding
 Says Turn him over pray

So the exercises taper
 Through gradations of delight
To the reading of The Paper
 Which is entertainingquite
For it goes ahead and mentions
 If a certain Mr O
Has serious intentions
 That he ought to tell her so

It also Asks permission
 To intimate to John
The dubious condition
 Of the ground hes standing on
And dropping the suggestion
 To mind what hes about
It stuns him with the question
 Does his mother know hes out

And among the contributions
 To this Academic Press
Are Versified Effusions
 ByOur lady editress
Which fact is proudly stated
 By the CHIEF of the concern
Though the verse communicated
 Bears the penname Fanny Fern 

      
When all has been recited
 And the teachers bell is heard
And visitors invited
 Have dropped a kindly word
A hush of holy feeling
 Falls down upon us there
As though the day were kneeling
 With the twilight for the prayer

      
Midst the wealth of facts and fancies
 That our memories may recall
Thus the old schoolday romances
 Are the dearest after all
When some sweet thought revises
 The halfforgotten tune
That opened Exercises
 On Friday Afternoon


JOHNSONS BOY

The world is turned agin me
 And people says They guess
That nothin else is in me
 But pure maliciousness
I git the blame for doin
 What other chaps destroy
And Im agoin to ruin
 Because Im Johnsons boy

THAT aint my nameId ruther
 Theyd call me IKE or PAT
But theyve forgot the other
 And so have _I_ for that
I reckon its as handy
 When Nibsy breaks his toy
Or some one steals his candy
 To say twas JOHNSONS BOY

You cant git any water
 At the pump and find the spout
So durn chuckfull o mortar
 That you have to bore it out
You tackle any scholar
 In Wisdoms wise employ
And Ill bet you half a dollar
 Hell say its Johnsons boy

Folks dont know how I suffer
 In my uncomplainin way
They think Im gittin tougher
 And tougher every day
Last Sunday night when Flinder
 Was ashoutin out for joy
And some one shook the winder
 He prayed for Johnsons boy

Im tired of bein follered
 By farmers every day
And then o bein collared
 For coaxin hounds away
Hounds always plays me double
 Its a trick they all enjoy
To git me into trouble
 Because Im Johnsons boy

But if I git to Heaven
 I hope the Lordll see
SOME boy has been perfect
 And lay it on to me
Ill swell the song sonorous
 And clap my wings for joy
And sail off on the chorus
 Hurrah for Johnsons boy


HER BEAUTIFUL HANDS

Your handsthey are strangely fair
O Fairfor the jewels that sparkle there
Fairfor the witchery of the spell
That ivory keys alone can tell
But when their delicate touches rest
Here in my own do I love them best
As I clasp with eager acquisitive spans
My glorious treasure of beautiful hands

Marvelouswonderfulbeautiful hands
They can coax roses to bloom in the strands
Of your brown tresses and ribbons will twine
Under mysterious touches of thine
Into such knots as entangle the soul
And fetter the heart under such a control
As only the strength of my love understands
My passionate love for your beautiful hands

As I remember the first fair touch
Of those beautiful hands that I love so much
I seem to thrill as I then was thrilled
Kissing the glove that I found unfilled
When I met your gaze and the queenly bow
As you said to me laughingly Keep it now   
And dazed and alone in a dream I stand
Kissing this ghost of your beautiful hand

When first I loved in the long ago
And held your hand as I told you so
Pressed and caressed it and gave it a kiss
And said I could die for a hand like this
Little I dreamed loves fullness yet
Had to ripen when eyes were wet
And prayers were vain in their wild demands
For one warm touch of your beautiful hands

        
Beautiful HandsO Beautiful Hands
Could you reach out of the alien lands
Where you are lingering and give me tonight
Only a touchwere it ever so light
My heart were soothed and my weary brain
Would lull itself into rest again
For there is no solace the world commands
Like the caress of your beautiful hands


NATURAL PERVERSITIES

I am not prone to moralize
 In scientific doubt
On certain facts that Nature tries
 To puzzle us about
For I am no philosopher
 Of wise elucidation
But speak of things as they occur
 From simple observation

I notice LITTLE thingsto wit
 I never missed a train
Because I didnt RUN for it
 I never knew it rain
That my umbrella wasnt lent
 Or when in my possession
The sun but wore to all intent
 A jocular expression

I never knew a creditor
 To dun me for a debt
But I was cramped or busted or
 I never knew one yet
When I had plenty in my purse
 To make the least invasion
As I accordingly perverse
 Have courted no occasion

Nor do I claim to comprehend
 What Nature has in view
In giving us the very friend
 To trust we oughtnt to
But so it is The trusty gun
 Disastrously exploded
Is always sure to be the one
 We didnt think was loaded

Our moaning is anothers mirth
 And what is worse by half
We say the funniest thing on earth
 And never raise a laugh
Mid friends that love us over well
 And sparkling jests and liquor
Our hearts somehow are liable
 To melt in tears the quicker

We reach the wrong when most we seek
 The right in like effect
We stay the strong and not the weak
 Do most when we neglect
Neglected geniustruth be said
 As wild and quick as tinder
The more you seek to help ahead
 The more you seem to hinder

Ive known the least the greatest too
 And on the selfsame plan
The biggest fool I ever knew
 Was quite a little man
We find we ought and then we wont
 We prove a thing then doubt it
Know EVERYTHING but when we dont
 Know ANYTHING about it


THE SILENT VICTORS

MAY 30 1878

Dying for victory cheer on cheer
Thundered on his eager ear
 CHARLES L HOLSTEIN

I

Deep tender firm and true the Nations heart
 Throbs for her gallant heroes passed away
Who in grim Battles drama played their part
 And slumber here today

Warm hearts that beat their lives out at the shrine
 Of Freedom while our country held its breath
As brave battalions wheeled themselves in line
 And marched upon their death

When Freedoms Flag its natal wounds scarce healed
 Was torn from peaceful winds and flung again
To shudder in the storm of battlefield
 The elements of men

When every star that glittered was a mark
 For Treasons ball and every rippling bar
Of red and white was sullied with the dark
 And purple stain of war

When angry guns like famished beasts of prey
 Were howling oer their gory feast of lives
And sending dismal echoes far away
 To mothers maids and wives

The mother kneeling in the empty night
 With pleading hands uplifted for the son
Who even as she prayed had fought the fight
 The victory had won

The wife with trembling hand that wrote to say
 The babe was waiting for the sires caress
The letter meeting that upon the way
 The babe was fatherless

The maiden with her lips in fancy pressed
 Against the brow once dewy with her breath
Now lying numb unknown and uncaressed
 Save by the dews of death

II

What meed of tribute can the poet pay
 The Soldier but to trail the ivyvine
Of idle rhyme above his grave today
 In epitaph design

Or wreathe with laurelwords the icy brows
 That ache no longer with a dream of fame
But pillowed lowly in the narrow house
 Renowned beyond the name

The dewy teardrops of the night may fall
 And tender morning with her shining hand
May brush them from the grasses green and tall
 That undulate the land

Yet song of Peace nor din of toil and thrift
 Nor chanted honors with the flowers we heap
Can yield us hope the Heros head to lift
 Out of its dreamless sleep

The dear old Flag whose faintest flutter flies
 A stirring echo through each patriot breast
Can never coax to life the folded eyes
 That saw its wrongs redressed

That watched it waver when the fight was hot
 And blazed with newer courage to its aid
Regardless of the shower of shell and shot
 Through which the charge was made

And when at last they saw it plume its wings
 Like some proud bird in stormy element
And soar untrammeled on its wanderings
 They closed in death content

III

O Mother you who miss the smiling face
 Of that dear boy who vanished from your sight
And left you weeping oer the vacant place
 He used to fill at night

Who left you dazed bewildered on a day
 That echoed wild huzzas and roar of guns
That drowned the farewell words you tried to say
 To incoherent ones

Be glad and proud you had the life to give
 Be comforted through all the years to come
Your country has a longer life to live
 Your son a better home

O Widow weeping oer the orphaned child
 Who only lifts his questioning eyes to send
A keener pang to grief unreconciled
 Teach him to comprehend

He had a father brave enough to stand
 Before the fire of Treasons blazing gun
That dying he might will the rich old land
 Of Freedom to his son

And Maiden living on through lonely years
 In fealty to loves enduring ties
With strong faith gleaming through the tender tears
 That gather in your eyes

Look up and own in gratefulness of prayer
 Submission to the will of Heavens High Host
I see your Angelsoldier pacing there
 Expectant at his post

I see the rank and file of armies vast
 That muster under one supreme control
I hear the trumpet sound the signalblast
 The calling of the roll

The grand divisions falling into line
 And forming under voice of One alone
Who gives command and joins with tongue divine
 The hymn that shakes the Throne

IV

And thus in tribute to the forms that rest
 In their last campingground we strew the bloom
And fragrance of the flowers they loved the best
 In silence oer the tomb

With reverent hands we twine the Heros wreath
 And clasp it tenderly on stake or stone
That stands the sentinel for each beneath
 Whose glory is our own

While in the violet that greets the sun
 We see the azure eye of some lost boy
And in the rose the ruddy cheek of one
 We kissed in childish joy

Recalling haply when he marched away
 He laughed his loudest though his eyes were wet
The kiss he gave his mothers brow that day
 Is there and burning yet

And through the storm of grief around her tossed
 One ray of saddest comfort she may see
Four hundred thousand sons like hers were lost
 To weeping Liberty

        
But draw aside the drapery of gloom
 And let the sunshine chase the clouds away
And gild with brighter glory every tomb
 We decorate today

And in the holy silence reigning round
 While prayers of perfume bless the atmosphere
Where loyal souls of love and faith are found
 Thank God that Peace is here

And let each angry impulse that may start
 Be smothered out of every loyal breast
And rocked within the cradle of the heart
 Let every sorrow rest


SCRAPS

Theres a habit I have nurtured
 From the sentimental time
When my life was like a story
 And my heart a happy rhyme
Of clipping from the paper
 Or magazine perhaps
The idle songs of dreamers
 Which I treasure as my scraps

They hide among my letters
 And they find a cozy nest
In the bosom of my wrapper
 And the pockets of my vest
They clamber in my fingers
 Till my dreams of wealth relapse
In fairer dreams than Fortunes
 Though I find them only scraps

Sometimes I find in tatters
 Like a beggar form as fair
As ever gave to Heaven
 The treasure of a prayer
And words all dim and faded
 And obliterate in part
Grow into fadeless meanings
 That are printed on the heart

Sometimes a childish jingle
 Flings an echo sweet and clear
And thrills me as I listen
 To the laughs I used to hear
And I catch the gleam of faces
 And the glimmer of glad eyes
That peep at me expectant
 Oer the walls of Paradise

O syllables of measure
 Though you wheel yourselves in line
And await the further order
 Of this eager voice of mine
You are powerless to follow
 Oer the field my fancy maps
So I lead you back to silence
 Feeling you are only scraps


AUGUST

A day of torpor in the sullen heat
 Of Summers passion In the sluggish stream
The panting cattle lave their lazy feet
 With drowsy eyes and dream

Long since the winds have died and in the sky
 There lives no cloud to hint of Natures grief
The sun glares ever like an evil eye
 And withers flower and leaf

Upon the gleaming harvestfield remote
 The thresher lies deserted like some old
Dismantled galleon that hangs afloat
 Upon a sea of gold

The yearning cry of some bewildered bird
 Above an empty nest and truant boys
Along the rivers shady margin heard
 A harmony of noise

A melody of wrangling voices blent
 With liquid laughter and with rippling calls
Of piping lips and thrilling echoes sent
 To mimic waterfalls

And through the hazy veil the atmosphere
 Has draped about the gleaming face of Day
The sifted glances of the sun appear
 In splinterings of spray

The dusty highway like a cloud of dawn
 Trails oer the hillside and the passerby
A tired ghost in misty shroud toils on
 His journey to the sky

And down across the valleys drooping sweep
 Withdrawn to farthest limit of the glade
The forest stands in silence drinking deep
 Its purple wine of shade

The gossamer floats up on phantom wing
 The sailorvision voyages the skies
And carries into chaos everything
 That freights the weary eyes

Till throbbing on and on the pulse of heat
 Increasesreachespasses fevers height
And Day sinks into slumber cool and sweet
 Within the arms of Night


DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME

 DIEDEarly morning of September 5 1876 and
in the gleaming dawn of name and fame
Hamilton J Dunbar

Dead Dead Dead
 We thought him ours alone
And were so proud to see him tread
The rounds of fame and lift his head
 Where sunlight ever shone
But now our aching eyes are dim
And look through tears in vain for him

Name Name Name
 It was his diadem
Nor ever tarnishtaint of shame
Could dim its lusterlike a flame
 Reflected in a gem
He wears it blazing on his brow
Within the courts of Heaven now

Tears Tears Tears
 Like dews upon the leaf
That bursts at lastfrom out the years
The blossom of a trust appears
 That blooms above the grief
And mother brother wife and child
Will see it and be reconciled


IN THE DARK

O In the depths of midnight
 What fancies haunt the brain
When even the sigh of the sleeper
 Sounds like a sob of pain

A sense of awe and of wonder
 I may never well define
For the thoughts that come in the shadows
 Never come in the shine

The old clock down in the parlor
 Like a sleepless mourner grieves
And the seconds drip in the silence
 As the rain drips from the eaves

And I think of the hands that signal
 The hours there in the gloom
And wonder what angel watchers
 Wait in the darkened room

And I think of the smiling faces
 That used to watch and wait
Till the click of the clock was answered
 By the click of the opening gate

They are not there now in the evening
 Morning or noonnot there
Yet I know that they keep their vigil
 And wait for me Somewhere


THE IRON HORSE

No song is mine of Arab steed
 My courser is of nobler blood
And cleaner limb and fleeter speed
 And greater strength and hardihood
Than ever cantered wild and free
Across the plains of Araby

Go search the level desert land
From Sana on to Samarcand
Wherever Persian prince has been
Or Dervish Sheik or Bedouin
And I defy you there to point
 Me out a steed the half so fine
From tip of ear to pasternjoint
 As this old iron horse of mine

You do not know what beauty is
 You do not know what gentleness
 His answer is to my caress
Why look upon this gait of his
A touch upon his iron rein
 He moves with such a stately grace
The sunlight on his burnished mane
 Is barely shaken in its place
 And at a touch he changes pace
And gliding backward stops again

And talk of mettleAh my friend
 Such passion smolders in his breast
That when awakened it will send
 A thrill of rapture wilder than
 Eer palpitated heart of man
 When flaming at its mightiest
And theres a fierceness in his ire
 A maddened majesty that leaps
Along his veins in blood of fire
 Until the path his vision sweeps
Spins out behind him like a thread
 Unraveled from the reel of time
 As wheeling on his course sublime
The earth revolves beneath his tread

Then stretch away my gallant steed
 Thy mission is a noble one
 Thou bearst the father to the son
And sweet relief to bitter need
Thou bearst the stranger to his friends
 Thou bearst the pilgrim to the shrine
And back again the prayer he sends
 That God will prosper me and mine
The star that on thy forehead gleams
Has blossomed in our brightest dreams

Then speed thee on thy glorious race
The mother waits thy ringing pace
The father leans an anxious ear
The thunder of thy hooves to hear
The lover listens far away
To catch thy keen exultant neigh
And where thy breathings roll and rise
The husband strains his eager eyes
And laugh of wife and babyglee
Ring out to greet and welcome thee
Then stretch away and when at last
 The masters hand shall gently check
Thy mighty speed and hold thee fast
 The world will pat thee on the neck


DEAD LEAVES

 DAWN

As though a gipsy maiden with dim look
 Sat crooning by the roadside of the year
 So Autumn in thy strangeness thou art here
To read dark fortunes for us from the book
Of fate thou flingest in the crinkled brook
 The trembling maples gold and frostyclear
 Thy mocking laughter thrills the atmosphere
And drifting on its current calls the rook
To other lands As one who wades alone
 Deep in the dusk and hears the minor talk
Of distant melody and finds the tone
 In some wierd way compelling him to stalk
The paths of childhood overso I moan
 And like a troubled sleeper groping walk

 DUSK

The frightened herds of clouds across the sky
 Trample the sunshine down and chase the day
 Into the dusky forestlands of gray
And somber twilight Far and faint and high
The wild goose trails his harrow with a cry
 Sad as the wail of some poor castaway
 Who sees a vessel drifting far astray
Of his last hope and lays him down to die
The children riotous from school grow bold
 And quarrel with the wind whose angry gust
Plucks off the summer hat and flaps the fold
 Of many a crimson cloak and twirls the dust
In spiral shapes grotesque and dims the gold
 Of gleaming tresses with the blur of rust

 NIGHT

Funereal Darkness drear and desolate
 Muffles the world The moaning of the wind
 Is piteous with sobs of saddest kind
And laughter is a phantom at the gate
Of memory The longneglected grate
 Within sprouts into flame and lights the mind
 With hopes and wishes long ago refined
To asheslong departed friends await
 Our words of welcome and our lips are dumb
And powerless to greet the ones that press
 Old kisses there The baby beats its drum
And fancy marches to the dear caress
 Of motherarms and all the gleeful hum
Of home intrudes upon our loneliness


OVER THE EYES OF GLADNESS

The voice of One hath spoken
 And the bended reed is bruised
The golden bowl is broken
 And the silver cord is loosed

Over the eyes of gladness
 The lids of sorrow fall
And the light of mirth is darkened
 Under the funeral pall

The hearts that throbbed with rapture
 In dreams of the future years
Are wakened from their slumbers
 And their visions drowned in tears

       
Two buds on the bough in the morning
 Twin buds in the smiling sun
But the frost of death has fallen
 And blighted the bloom of one

One leaf of life still folded
 Has fallen from the stem
Leaving the symbol teaching
 There still are two of them

For thoughthrough Times gradations
 The LIVING bud may burst
The WITHERED one is gathered
 And blooms in Heaven first


ONLY A DREAM

Only a dream
 Her head is bent
Over the keys of the instrument
While her trembling fingers go astray
In the foolish tune she tries to play
He smiles in his heart though his deep sad eyes
Never change to a glad surprise
As he finds the answer he seeks confessed
In glowing features and heaving breast

Only a dream
 Though the fete is grand
And a hundred hearts at her command
She takes no part for her soul is sick
Of the Coquettes art and the Serpents trick
She someway feels she would like to fling
Her sins away as a robe and spring
Up like a lily pure and white
And bloom alone for HIM tonight

Only a dream
 That the fancy weaves
The lids unfold like the roses leaves
And the upraised eyes are moist and mild
As the prayerful eyes of a drowsy child
Does she remember the spell they once
Wrought in the past a few short months
Haply notyet her lovers eyes
Never change to the glad surprise

Only a dream
 He winds her form
Close in the coil of his curving arm
And whirls her away in a gust of sound
As wild and sweet as the poets found
In the paradise where the silken tent
Of the Persian blooms in the Orient
While ever the chords of the music seem
Whispering sadlyOnly a dream


OUR LITTLE GIRL

Her heart knew naught of sorrow
 Nor the vaguest taint of sin
Twas an everblooming blossom
 Of the purity within
And her hands knew only touches
 Of the mothers gentle care
And the kisses and caresses
 Through the interludes of prayer

Her babyfeet had journeyed
 Such a little distance here
They could have found no briers
 In the path to interfere
The little cross she carried
 Could not weary her we know
For it lay as lightly on her
 As a shadow on the snow

And yet the way before us
 O how empty now and drear
How evn the dews of roses
 Seem as dripping tears for her
And the songbirds all seem crying
 As the winds cry and the rain
All sobbinglyWe wantwe want
 Our little girl again


THE FUNNY LITTLE FELLOW

Twas a Funny Little Fellow
 Of the very purest type
For he had a heart as mellow
 As an apple over ripe
And the brightest little twinkle
 When a funny thing occurred
And the lightest little tinkle
 Of a laugh you ever heard

His smile was like the glitter
 Of the sun in tropic lands
And his talk a sweeter twitter
 Than the swallow understands
Hear him singand tell a story
 Snap a jokeignite a pun
Twas a captureraptureglory
 An explosionall in one

Though he hadnt any money
 That condiment which tends
To make a fellow honey
 For the palate of his friends
Sweet simples he compounded
 Sovereign antidotes for sin
Or tainta faith unbounded
 That his friends were genuine

He wasnt honored maybe
 For his songs of praise were slim
Yet I never knew a baby
 That wouldnt crow for him
I never knew a mother
 But urged a kindly claim
Upon him as a brother
 At the mention of his name

The sick have ceased their sighing
 And have even found the grace
Of a smile when they were dying
 As they looked upon his face
And Ive seen his eyes of laughter
 Melt in tears that only ran
As though swiftdancing after
 Came the Funny Little Man

He laughed away the sorrow
 And he laughed away the gloom
We are all so prone to borrow
 From the darkness of the tomb
And he laughed across the ocean
 Of a happy life and passed
With a laugh of glad emotion
 Into Paradise at last

And I think the Angels knew him
 And had gathered to await
His coming and run to him
 Through the widely opened Gate
With their faces gleaming sunny
 For his laughterloving sake
And thinking What a funny
 Little Angel he will make


SONG OF THE NEW YEAR

I heard the bells at midnight
 Ring in the dawning year
And above the clanging chorus
 Of the song I seemed to hear
A choir of mystic voices
 Flinging echoes ringing clear
From a band of angels winging
 Through the haunted atmosphere
 Ring out the shame and sorrow
 And the misery and sin
 That the dawning of the morrow
 May in peace be ushered in

And I thought of all the trials
 The departed years had cost
And the blooming hopes and pleasures
 That are withered now and lost
And with joy I drank the music
 Stealing oer the feeling there
As the spirit song came pealing
 On the silence everywhere
 Ring out the shame and sorrow
 And the misery and sin
 That the dawning of the morrow
 May in peace be ushered in

And I listened as a lover
 To an utterance that flows
In syllables like dewdrops
 From the red lips of a rose
Till the anthem fainter growing
 Climbing higher chiming on
Up the rounds of happy rhyming
 Slowly vanished in the dawn
 Ring out the shame and sorrow
 And the misery and sin
 That the dawning of the morrow
 May in peace be ushered in

Then I raised my eyes to Heaven
 And with trembling lips I pled
For a blessing for the living
 And a pardon for the dead
And like a ghost of music
 Slowly whisperedlowly sung
Came the echo pure and holy
 In the happy angel tongue
 Ring out the shame and sorrow
 And the misery and sin
 And the dawn of every morrow
 Will in peace be ushered in


A LETTER TO A FRIEND

The past is like a story
 I have listened to in dreams
That vanished in the glory
 Of the Mornings early gleams
Andat my shadow glancing
 I feel a loss of strength
As the Day of Life advancing
 Leaves it shorn of half its length

But its all in vain to worry
 At the rapid race of Time
And he flies in such a flurry
 When I trip him with a rhyme
Ill bother him no longer
 Than to thank you for the thought
That my fame is growing stronger
 As you really think it ought

And though I fall below it
 I might know as much of mirth
To live and die a poet
 Of unacknowledged worth
For Fame is but a vagrant
 Though a loyal one and brave
And his laurels neer so fragrant
 As when scattered oer the grave


LINES FOR AN ALBUM

I would not trace the hackneyed phrase
Of shallow words and empty praise
And prate of peace till one might think
My foolish pen was drunk with ink
Nor will I here the wish express
Of lasting love and happiness
And cloudless skiesfor after all
Into each life some rain must fall
No Keep the empty page below
In my remembrance white as snow
Nor sigh to know the secret prayer
My spirit hand has written there


TO ANNIE

When the lids of dusk are falling
 Oer the dreamy eyes of day
And the whippoorwills are calling
 And the lesson laid away
May Memry soft and tender
 As the prelude of the night
Bend over you and render
 As tranquil a delight


FAME

I

Once in a dream I saw a man
 With haggard face and tangled hair
And eyes that nursed as wild a care
 As gaunt Starvation ever can
And in his hand he held a wand
 Whose magic touch gave life and thought
 Unto a form his fancy wrought
And robed with coloring so grand
 It seemed the reflex of some child
 Of Heaven fair and undefiled
 A face of purity and love
 To woo him into worlds above
And as I gazed with dazzled eyes
 A gleaming smile lit up his lips
 As his bright soul from its eclipse
Went flashing into Paradise
Then tardy Fame came through the door
And found a picturenothing more

II

And once I saw a man alone
 In abject poverty with hand
Uplifted oer a block of stone
 That took a shape at his command
And smiled upon him fair and good
A perfect work of womanhood
Save that the eyes might never weep
Nor weary hands be crossed in sleep
Nor hair that fell from crown to wrist
Be brushed away caressed and kissed
And as in awe I gazed on her
 I saw the sculptors chisel fall
 I saw him sink without a moan
 Sink lifeless at the feet of stone
And lie there like a worshiper
 Fame crossed the threshold of the hall
 And found a statuethat was all

III

And once I saw a man who drew
 A gloom about him like a cloak
And wandered aimlessly The few
 Who spoke of him at all but spoke
Disparagingly of a mind
The Fates had faultily designed
Too indolent for modern times
 Too fanciful and full of whims
For talking to himself in rhymes
 And scrawling neverheardof hymns
The idle life to which he clung
Was worthless as the songs he sung
I saw him in my vision filled
 With rapture oer a spray of bloom
 The wind threw in his lonely room
And of the sweet perfume it spilled
He drank to drunkenness and flung
His long hair back and laughed and sung
And clapped his hands as children do
At fairy tales they listen to
While from his flying quill there dripped
Such music on his manuscript
That he who listens to the words
May close his eyes and dream the birds
Are twittering on every hand
A language he can understand
He journeyed on through life unknown
Without one friend to call his own
He tired No kindly hand to press
The cooling touch of tenderness
Upon his burning brow nor lift
To his parched lips Gods freest gift
No sympathetic sob or sigh
Of trembling lipsno sorrowing eye
Looked out through tears to see him die
And Fame her greenest laurels brought
To crown a head that heeded not

And this is Fame A thing indeed
That only comes when least the need
The wisest minds of every age
The book of life from page to page
Have searched in vain each lesson conned
Will promise it the page beyond
Until the last when dusk of night
Falls over it and reasons light
Is smothered by that unknown friend
Who signs his nom de plume The End


AN EMPTY NEST

I find an old deserted nest
 Halfhidden in the underbrush
A withered leaf in phantom jest
 Has nestled in it like a thrush
With weary palpitating breast

I muse as one in sad surprise
 Who seeks his childhoods home once more
And finds it in a strange disguise
 Of vacant rooms and naked floor
With sudden teardrops in his eyes

An empty nest It used to bear
 A happy burden when the breeze
Of summer rocked it and a pair
 Of merry tattlers told the trees
What treasures they had hidden there

But Fancy flitting through the gleams
 Of youths sunshiny atmosphere
Has fallen in the past and seems
 Like this poor leaflet nestled here
A phantom guest of empty dreams


MY FATHERS HALLS

My fathers halls so rich and rare
Are desolate and bleak and bare
My fathers heart and halls are one
Since I their life and light am gone

O valiant knight with hand of steel
And heart of gold hear my appeal
Release me from the spoilers charms
And bear me to my fathers arms


THE HARP OF THE MINSTREL

The harp of the minstrel has never a tone
 As sad as the song in his bosom tonight
For the magical touch of his fingers alone
 Can not waken the echoes that breathe it aright
But oh as the smile of the moon may impart
 A sorrow to one in an alien clime
Let the light of the melody fall on the heart
 And cadence his grief into musical rhyme

The faces have faded the eyes have grown dim
 That once were his passionate love and his pride
And alas all the smiles that once blossomed for him
 Have fallen away as the flowers have died
The hands that entwined him the laureates wreath
 And crowned him with fame in the long long ago
Like the laurels are withered and folded beneath
 The grass and the stubblethe frost and the snow

Then sigh if thou wilt as the whispering strings
 Strive ever in vain for the utterance clear
And think of the sorrowful spirit that sings
 And jewel the song with the gem of a tear
For the harp of the minstrel has never a tone
 As sad as the song in his bosom tonight
And the magical touch of his fingers alone
 Can not waken the echoes that breathe it aright


HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB

How slight a thing may set ones fancy drifting
 Upon the dead sea of the PastA view
Sometimes an odoror a rooster lifting
 A faroff OOH OOHOOH

And suddenly we find ourselves astray
 In some woodspasture of the Long Ago
Or idly dream again upon a day
 Of rest we used to know

I bit an apple but a moment since
 A wilted apple that the worm had spurned
Yet hidden in the taste were happy hints
 Of good old days returned

And so my heart like some enraptured lute
 Tinkles a tune so tender and complete
Gods blessing must be resting on the fruit
 So bitter yet so sweet


JOHN WALSH

A strange lifestrangely passed
 We may not read the soul
 When God has folded up the scroll
 In death at last
We may notdare not say of one
Whose task of life as well was done
As he could do itThis is lost
And prayers may never pay the cost

Who listens to the song
 That sings within the breast
 Should ever hear the good expressed
 Above the wrong
And he who leans an eager ear
To catch the discord he will hear
The echoes of his own weak heart
Beat out the most discordant part

Whose tender heart could build
 Affections bower above
 A heart where baby nests of love
 Were ever filled
With upward growth may reach and twine
About the children grown divine
That once were his a time so brief
His very joy was more than grief

O SorrowPeace be still
 God reads the riddle right
 And we who grope in constant night
 But serve His will
And when sometime the doubt is gone
And darkness blossoms into dawn
God keeps the good we then will say
 Tis but the dross He throws away


ORLIE WILDE

A goddess with a sirens grace
A sunhaired girl on a craggy place
Above a bay where fishboats lay
Drifting about like birds of prey

Wrought was she of a painters dream
Wise only as are artists wise
My artistfriend Rolf Herschkelhiem
With deep sad eyes of oversize
And face of melancholy guise

I pressed him that he tell to me
This masterpieces history
He turnedREturnedand thus beguiled
Me with the tale of Orlie Wilde

We artists live ideally
We breed our firmest facts of air
We make our own reality
We dream a thing and it is so
The fairest scenes we ever see
Are mirages of memory
The sweetest thoughts we ever know
We plagiarize from Long Ago
And as the girl on canvas there
Is marvelously rare and fair
Tis only inasmuch as she
Is dumb and may not speak to me
He tapped me with his mahlstickthen
The pictureand went on again

Orlie Wilde the fishers child
I see her yet as fair and mild
As ever nursling summer day
Dreamed on the bosom of the bay
For I was twenty then and went
Alone and longhairedall content
With promises of sounding name
And fantasies of future fame
And thoughts that now my mind discards
As editor a fledgling bards

At evening once I chanced to go
With pencil and portfolio
Adown the street of silver sand
That winds beneath this craggy land
To make a sketch of some old scurf
Of driftage nosing through the surf
A splintered mast with knarl and strand
Of riggingrope and tattered threads
Of flag and streamer and of sail
That fluttered idly in the gale
Or whipped themselves to sadder shreds
The while I wrought half listlessly
On my dismantled subject came
A seabird settling on the same
With plaintive moan as though that he
Had lost his mate upon the sea
Andwith my melancholy trend
It brought dim dreams half understood
It wrought upon my morbid mood
I thought of my own voyagings
That had no endthat have no end
And like the seabird I made moan
That I was loveless and alone
And when at last with weary wings
It went upon its wanderings
With upturned face I watched its flight
Until this picture met my sight
A goddess with a sirens grace
A sunhaired girl on a craggy place
Above a bay where fishboats lay
Drifting about like birds of prey

In airy poise she gazing stood
A machless form of womanhood
That brought a thought that if for me
Such eyes had sought across the sea
I could have swum the widest tide
That ever mariner defied
And at the shore could on have gone
To that high crag she stood upon
To there entreat and say My Sweet
Behold thy servant at thy feet
And to my soul I said Above
There stands the idol of thy love

In this rapt awed ecstatic state
I gazedtill lo I was aware
A fisherman had joined her there
A weary man with halting gait
Who toiled beneath a baskets weight
Her father as I guessed for she
Had run to meet him gleefully
And taen his burden to herself
That perched upon her shoulders shelf
So lightly that she tripping neared
A jutting crag and disappeared
But she left the echo of a song
That thrills me yet and will as long
As I have being   


    Evenings came
And wentbut each the samethe same
She watched above and even so
I stood there watching from below
Till grown so bold at last I sung
What matter now the theme thereof
It brought an answer from her tongue
Faint as the murmur of a dove
Yet all the more the song of love   

I turned and looked upon the bay
With palm to foreheadeyes ablur
In the seas smilemeant but for her
I saw the fishboats far away
In misty distance lightly drawn
In chalkdots on the horizon
Looked back at her long wistfully
And pushing off an empty skiff
I beckoned her to quit the cliff
And yield me her rare company
Upon a little pleasurecruise
She stood as loathful to refuse
To muse for full a moments time
Then answered back in pantomime
She feared some danger from the sea
Were she discovered thus with me
I motioned then to ask her if
I might not join her on the cliff
And back again with graceful wave
Of lifted arm she answer gave
She feared some danger from the sea

Impatient piqued impetuous I
Sprang in the boat and flung Goodby
From pouted mouth with angry hand
And madly pulled away from land
With lusty stroke despite that she
Held out her hands entreatingly
And when far out with covert eye
I shoreward glanced I saw her fly
In reckless haste adown the crag
Her hair aflutter like a flag
Of gold that danced across the strand
In little mists of silver sand
All curious I pausing tried
To fancy what it all implied
When suddenly I found my feet
Were wet and underneath the seat
On which I sat I heard the sound
Of gurgling waters and I found
The boat aleak alarmingly   
I turned and looked upon the sea
Whose every wave seemed mocking me
I saw the fishers sails once more
In dimmer distance than before
I saw the seabird wheeling by
With foolish wish that _I_ could fly
I thought of firm earth home and friends
I thought of everything that tends
To drive a man to frenzy and
To wholly lose his own command
I thought of all my waywardness
Thought of a mothers deep distress
Of youthful follies yet unpurged
Sins as the seas about me surged
Thought of the printers ready pen
Tomorrow drowning me again
A million things without a name
I thought of everything butFame   

A memory yet is in my mind
So keenly clear and sharpdefined
I picture every phase and line
Of life and death and neither mine
While some fair seraph goldenhaired
Bends over mewith white arms bared
That strongly plait themselves about
My drowning weight and lift me out
With joy too great for words to state
Or tongue to dare articulate

And this seraphic oceanchild
And heroine was Orlie Wilde
And thus it was I came to hear
Her voices music in my ear
Ay thus it was Fate paved the way
That I walk desolate today   

The artist paused and bowed his face
Within his palms a little space
While reverently on his form
I bent my gaze and marked a storm
That shook his frame as wrathfully
As some typhoon of agony
And fraught with sobsthe more profound
For that peculiar laughing sound
We hear when strong men weep    I leant
With warmest sympathyI bent
To stroke with soothing hand his brow
He murmuringTis over now

And shall I tie the silken thread
Of my frail romance Yes I said
He faintly smiled and then with brow
In kneading palm as one in dread
His tasseled cap pushed from his head
 Her voices music I repeat
He said twas sweetO passing sweet
Though she herself in uttering
Its melody proved not the thing
Of loveliness my dreams made meet
For methere yearning at her feet
Prone at her feeta worshiper
For lo she spake a tongue moaned he
Unknown to meunknown to me
As mine to heras mine to her


THAT OTHER MAUD MULLER

Maud Muller worked at making hay
And cleared her forty cents a day

Her clothes were coarse but her health was fine
And so she worked in the sweet sunshine

Singing as glad as a bird in May
Barbara Allen the livelong day

She often glanced at the faroff town
And wondered if eggs were up or down

And the sweet song died of a strange disease
Leaving a phantom taste of cheese

And an appetite and a nameless ache
For sodawater and ginger cake

The judge rode slowly into view
Stopped his horse in the shade and threw

His finecut out while the blushing Maud
Marveled much at the kind he chawed

He was dry as a fish he said with a wink
And kind o thought that a good square drink

Would brace him up So the cup was filled
With the crystal wine that old spring spilled

And she gave it him with a sunbrowned hand
Thanks said the judge in accents bland

A thousand thanks for a sweeter draught
From a fairer handbut there he laughed

And the sweet girl stood in the sun that day
And raked the judge instead of the hay


A MAN OF MANY PARTS

It was a man of many parts
 Who in his coffer mind
Had stored the Classics and the Arts
 And Sciences combined
The purest gems of poesy
 Came flashing from his pen
The wholesome truths of History
 He gave his fellow men

He knew the stars from Dog to Mars
 And he could tell you too
Their distancesas though the cars
 Had often checked him through
And time twould take to reach the sun
 Or by the Milky Way
Drop in upon the moon or run
 The homeward trip or stay

With Logic at his fingers ends
 Theology in mind
He often entertained his friends
 Until they died resigned
And with inquiring mind intent
 Upon Alchemic arts
A dynamite experiment
       
 A man of many parts


THE FROG

Who am I but the Frogthe Frog
 My realm is the dark bayou
And my throne is the muddy and mossgrown log
 That the poisonvine clings to
And the blacksnakes slide in the slimy tide
 Where the ghost of the moon looks blue

What am I but a Kinga King
 For the royal robes I wear
A scepter too and a signetring
 As vassals and serfs declare
And a voice god wot that is equaled not
 In the wide world anywhere

I can talk to the Nightthe Night
 Under her big black wing
She tells me the tale of the world outright
 And the secret of everything
For she knows you all from the time you crawl
 To the doom that death will bring

The Storm swoops down and he blowsand blows
 While I drum on his swollen cheek
And croak in his angered eye that glows
 With the lurid lightnings streak
While the rushes drown in the watery frown
 That his bursting passions leak

And I can see through the skythe sky
 As clear as a piece of glass
And I can tell you the how and why
 Of the things that come to pass
And whether the dead are there instead
 Or under the graveyard grass

To your Sovereign lord all hailall hail
 To your Prince on his throne so grim
Let the moon swing low and the high stars trail
 Their heads in the dust to him
And the wide world sing Long live the King
 And grace to his royal whim


DEAD SELVES

How many of my selves are dead
 The ghosts of many haunt me Lo
The baby in the tiny bed
With rockers on is blanketed
 And sleeping in the long ago
And so I ask with shaking head
How many of my selves are dead

A little face with drowsy eyes
 And lisping lips comes mistily
From out the faded past and tries
The prayers a mother breathed with sighs
 Of anxious care in teaching me
But face and form and prayers have fled
How many of my selves are dead

The little naked feet that slipped
 In truant paths and led the way
Through deadning pasturelands and tripped
Oer tangled poisonvines and dipped
 In streams forbiddenwhere are they
In vain I listen for their tread
How many of my selves are dead

The awkward boy the teacher caught
 Inditing letters filled with love
Who was compelled for all he fought
To read aloud each tender thought
 Of Sugar Lump and Turtle Dove
I wonder where he hides his head
How many of my selves are dead

The earnest features of a youth
 With manly fringe on lip and chin
With eager tongue to tell the truth
To offer love and life forsooth
 So brave was he to woo and win
A prouder man was never wed
How many of my selves are dead

The great strong hands so allinclined
 To welcome toil or smooth the care
From motherbrows or quick to find
A leisurescrap of any kind
 To toss the baby in the air
Or clap at babbling things it said
How many of my selves are dead

The pact of brawn and scheming brain
 Conspiring in the plots of wealth
Still delving till the lengthened chain
Unwindlassed in the mines of gain
 Recoils with dregs of ruined health
And pain and poverty instead
How many of my selves are dead

The faltering step the faded hair
 Head heart and soul all echoing
With maundering fancies that declare
That life and love were never there
 Nor ever joy in anything
Nor wounded heart that ever bled
How many of my selves are dead

So many of my selves are dead
 That bending here above the brink
Of my last grave with dizzy head
I find my spirit comforted
 For all the idle things I think
It can but be a peaceful bed
Since all my other selves are dead


A DREAM OF LONG AGO

Lying listless in the mosses
Underneath a tree that tosses
Flakes of sunshine and embosses
 Its green shadow with the snow
Drowsyeyed I sink in slumber
Born of fancies without number
Tangled fancies that encumber
 Me with dreams of long ago

Ripples of the river singing
And the waterlilies swinging
Bells of Parian and ringing
 Peals of perfume faint and fine
While old forms and fairy faces
Leap from out their hidingplaces
In the past with glad embraces
 Fraught with kisses sweet as wine

Willows dip their slender fingers
Oer the little fishers stringers
While he baits his hook and lingers
 Till the shadows gather dim
And afar off comes a calling
Like the sounds of water falling
With the lazy echoes drawling
 Messages of haste to him

Little naked feet that tinkle
Through the stubblefields and twinkle
Down the winding road and sprinkle
 Little mists of dusty rain
While in pasturelands the cattle
Cease their grazing with a rattle
Of the bells whose clappers tattle
 To their masters down the lane

Trees that hold their tempting treasures
Oer the orchards hedge embrasures
Furnish their forbidden pleasures
 As in Eden lands of old
And the coming of the master
Indicates a like disaster
To the frightened heart that faster
 Beats pulsations manifold

Puckered lips whose pipings tingle
In staccato notes that mingle
Musically with the jingle
 Haunted winds that lightly fan
Mellow twilights crimsontinted
By the sun and pictureprinted
Like a book that sweetly hinted
 Of the Nights Arabian

Porticoes with columns plaited
And entwined with vines and freighted
With a bloom all radiated
 With the light of moon and star
Where some tender voice is winging
In sad flights of song and singing
To the dancing fingers flinging
 Dripping from the sweet guitar

Would my dreams were never taken
From me that with faith unshaken
I might sleep and never waken
 On a weary world of woe
Links of love would never sever
As I dreamed them never never
I would glide along forever
 Through the dreams of long ago


CRAQUEODOOM

The Crankadox leaned oer the edge of the moon
 And wistfully gazed on the sea
Where the Gryxabodill madly whistled a tune
 To the air of Tifoldedingdee
The quavering shriek of the Flyupthecreek
 Was fitfully wafted afar
To the Queen of the Wunks as she powdered her cheek
 With the pulverized rays of a star

The Gool closed his ear on the voice of the Grig
 And his heart it grew heavy as lead
As he marked the Baldekin adjusting his wing
 On the opposite side of his head
And the air it grew chill as the Gryxabodill
 Raised his dank dripping fins to the skies
And plead with the Plunk for the use of her bill
 To pick the tears out of his eyes

The ghost of the Zhack flitted by in a trance
 And the Squidjum hid under a tub
As he heard the loud hooves of the Hooken advance
 With a rubadubdubadubdub
And the Crankadox cried as he lay down and died
 My fate there is none to bewail
While the Queen of the Wunks drifted over the tide
 With a long piece of crape to her tail


JUNE

Queenly month of indolent repose
 I drink thy breath in sips of rare perfume
 As in thy downy lap of cloverbloom
I nestle like a drowsy child and doze
The lazy hours away The zephyr throws
 The shifting shuttle of the Summers loom
 And weaves a damaskwork of gleam and gloom
Before thy listless feet The lily blows
A buglecall of fragrance oer the glade
 And wheeling into ranks with plume and spear
Thy harvestarmies gather on parade
 While faint and far away yet pure and clear
A voice calls out of alien lands of shade
 All hail the Peerless Goddess of the Year


WASH LOWRYS REMINISCENCE

And youre the poet of this concern
 Ive seed your name in print
A dozen times but Ill be dern
 Id a never a took the hint
O the size you arefer Id pictured you
 A kind of a tallish man
Darkcomplected and sallor too
 And on the consumpted plan

Stid o that youre little and small
 With a milkandwater face
Thout no snap in your eyes at all
 Er nothin to suit the case
Kind olook like aI dont know
 One o these fairground chaps
That runs a thingamajig to blow
 Er a candystand perhaps

Ll Ive allus thought that poetry
 Was a sort of asome disease
Fer I knowed a poet once and he
 Was techy and hard to please
And moodylike and kindo sad
 And didnt seem to mix
With other folkslike his health was bad
 Er his liver out o fix

Used to teach fer a livelihood
 Theres folks in Pipe Crick yit
Remembers himand he was good
 At cipherin Ill admit
And posted up in Gography
 But when it comes to tact
And gittin along with the school you see
 He fizzled and thats a fact

Boarded with us fer fourteen months
 And in all that time Ill say
We never catched him asleepin once
 Er idle a single day
But shucks It made him worse and worse
 Awritin rhymes and stuff
And the school committee used to furse
 At the school warnt good enough

He warnt as strict as he ought to been
 And never was known to whip
Or even to keep a scholard in
 At work at his penmanship
Stid o that hed learn em notes
 And have em every day
Spilin hymns and asplittin thoats
 With his Dosolfamera

Tel finally it was jest agreed
 Wed have to let him go
And we all felt badwe did indeed
 When we come to tell him so
Fer I remember he turned so white
 And smiled so sad somehow
I someway felt it wasnt right
 And Im shore it wasnt now

He hadnt no complaints at all
 He bid the school adieu
And all o the scholards great and small
 Was mighty sorry too
And when he closed that afternoon
 They sung some lines that he
Had writ a purpose to some old tune
 That suited the case you see

And then he lingered and delayed
 And wouldnt go away
And shet himself in his room and stayed
 Awritin from day to day
And kep agittin stranger still
 And thinner all the time
You know as any feller will
 On nothin else but rhyme

He didnt seem adzactly right
 Er like he was crossed in love
Hed work away night after night
 And walk the floor above
Wed hear him read and talk and sing
 So lonesomelike and low
My womans cried like everthing
 Way in the night you know

And when at last he tuck to bed
 Hed have his ink and pen
Sos he could coat the muse he said
 Hed die contented then
And jest before he past away
 He read with dyin gaze
The epitaph that stands today
 To show you where he lays

And ever sence then Ive allus thought
 That poetrys some disease
And them like you thats got it ought
 To watch their qs and ps 
And leave the sweets of rhyme to sup
 On the wholesome draughts of toil
And git your health recruited up
 By plowin in rougher soil


THE ANCIENT PRINTERMAN

O Printerman of sallow face
 And look of absent guile
Is it the copy on your case
 That causes you to smile
Or is it some old treasure scrap
 You cull from Memorys file

I fain would guess its mystery
 For often I can trace
A fellow dreamers history
 Wheneer it haunts the face
Your fancys running riot
 In a retrospective race

Ah Printerman youre straying
 Afar from stick and type
Your heart has gone amaying
 And you taste old kisses ripe
Again on lips that pucker
 At your old asthmatic pipe

You are dreaming of old pleasures
 That have faded from your view
And the musicburdened measures
 Of the laughs you listen to
Are now but angelechoes
 O have I spoken true

The ancient Printer hinted
 With a motion full of grace
To where the words were printed
 On a card above his case
I am deaf and dumb I left him
 With a smile upon his face

WHEN MOTHER COMBED MY HAIR

When Memory with gentle hand
Has led me to that foreign land
Of childhood days I long to be
Again the boy on bended knee
With head abow and drowsy smile
Hid in a mothers lap the while
With tender touch and kindly care
She bends above and combs my hair

Ere threats of Time or ghosts of cares
Had paled it to the hue it wears
Its tangled threads of amber light
Fell oer a forehead fair and white
That only knew the light caress
Of loving hands or sudden press
Of kisses that were sifted there
The times when mother combed my hair

But its last gleams of gold have slipped
Away and Sorrows manuscript
Is fashioned of the snowy brow
So lined and underscored now
That you to see it scarce would guess
It eer had felt the fond caress
Of loving lips or known the care
Of those dear hands that combed my hair

       

I am so tired Let me be
A moment at my mothers knee
One momentthat I may forget
The trials waiting for me yet
One moment free from every pain
O Mother Comb my hair again
And I will oh so humbly bow
For Ive a wife that combs it now



A WRANGDILLION

Dexerytethery down in the dike
 Under the ooze and the slime
Nestles the wraith of a reticent Gryke
 Blubbering bubbles of rhyme
Though the reeds touch him and tickle his teeth
 Though the Graigroll and the Cheest
Pluck at the leaves of his laureatewreath
 Nothing affects him the least

He sinks to the dregs in the dead o the night
 And he shuffles the shadows about
As he gathers the stars in a nest of delight
 And sets there and hatches them out
The Zhederrill peers from his watery mine
 In scorn with the Willothewisp
As he twinkles his eyes in a whisper of shine
 That ends in a luminous lisp

The Morning is born like a baby of gold
 And it lies in a spasm of pink
And rallies the Cheest for the horrible cold
 He has dragged to the willowy brink
The Gryke blots his tears with a scrap of his grief
 And growls at the wary Graigroll
As he twunkers a tune on a Tiljicum leaf
 And hums like a telegraph pole


GEORGE MULLENS CONFESSION

For the sake of guilty conscience and the heart that ticks the
time
Of the clockworks of my nature I desire to say that Im
A weak and sinful creature as regards my daily walk
The last five years and better It aint worth while to talk

Ive been too mean to tell it Ive been so hard you see
And full of pride andonrynow theres the word for me
Just onryand to show you Ill give my history
With vital points in question and I think youll all agree

I was always stiff and stubborn since I could recollect
And had an awful temper and never would reflect
And always into troubleI remember once at school
The teacher tried to flog me and I reversed that rule

O I was bad I tell you And its a funny move
That a fellow wild as I was could ever fall in love
And its a funny notion that an animal like me
Under a girls weak fingers was as tame as tame could be

But its so and sets me thinking of the easy way she had
Of cooling down my temperthough Id be fighting mad
My Lion Queen I called herwhen a spell of mine occurred
Shed come in a den of feelings and quell them with a word

Ill tell you how she loved meand what her people thought
When I asked to marry Annie they said they reckoned not
That I cut too many didoes and monkeyshines to suit
Their idea of a soninlaw and I could go to boot

I tell you that thing riled me Why I felt my face turn white
And my teeth shut like a steel trap and the fingers of my right
Hand pained me with their pressureall the rests a mystery
Till I heard my Annie sayingIm going too you see

We were coming through the gateway and she wavered for a spell
When she heard her mother crying and her raving father yell
That she want no child of hisnlike an actor in a play
We saw at Independence coming through the other day

Well thats the way we started And for days and weeks and
months
And even years we journeyed on regretting never once
Of starting out together upon the path of life
Akind o sort o husband but a mighty loving wife

And the cutest little babylittle GraceI see her now
Astandin on the pigpen as her mother milked the cow
And I can hear her shoutingas I stood unloading straw
Im aint as big as papa but Im biggerestn ma

Now folks that never married dont seem to understand
That a little babys language is the sweetest ever planned
Why I tell you its pure music and Ill just go on to say
That I sometimes have a notion that the angels talk that way

Theres a chapter in this story Id be happy to destroy
I could burn it up before you with a mighty sight of joy
But Ill go ahead and give itnot in detail no my friend
For it takes five years of reading before you find the end

My Annies folks relentedat least in some degree
They sent one time for Annie but they didnt send for me
The old man wrote the message with a heart as hot and dry
As a furnaceAnnie Mullen come and see your mother die

I saw the slur intendedwhy I fancied I could see
The old man shoot the insult like a poison dart at me
And in that heat of passion I swore an inward oath
That if Annie pleased her father she could never please us both

I watched herdark and sullenas she hurried on her shawl
I watched hercalm and cruel though I saw her teardrops fall
I watched hercold and heartless though I heard her moaning
call
For mercy from high Heavenand I smiled throughout it all

Why even when she kissed me and her tears were on my brow
As she murmured George forgive meI must go to mother now
Such hate there was within me that I answered not at all
But calm and cold and cruel I smiled throughout it all

But a shadow in the doorway caught my eye and then the face
Full of innocence and sunshine of little baby Grace
And I snatched her up and kissed her and I softened through and
through
For a minute when she told me I must kiss her muvver too

I remember at the starting how I tried to freeze again
As I watched them slowly driving down the little crooked lane
When Annie shouted something that ended in a cry
And how I tried to whistle and it fizzled in a sigh

I remember running after with a glimmer in my sight
Pretending Id discovered that the traces wasnt right
And the last that I remember as they disappeared from view
Was little Grace acalling I see papa Howdydo

And left alone to ponder I again took up my hate
For the old man who would chuckle that I was desolate
And I mouthed my wrongs in mutters till my pride called up the
pain
His last insult had given meuntil I smiled again

Till the wild beast in my nature was raging in the den
With no one now to quell it and I wrote a letter then
Full of hissing things and heated with so hot a heat of hate
That my pen flashed out black lightning at a most terrific rate

I wrote that she had wronged me when she went away from me
Though to see her dying mother twas her fathers victory
And a woman that could waver when her husbands pride was rent
Was no longer worthy of it And I shut the house and went

To tell of my long exile would be of little good
Though I couldnt halfway tell it and I wouldnt if I could
I could tell of Californiaof a wild and vicious life
Of trackless plains and mountains and the Indians
scalpingknife

I could tell of gloomy forests howling wild with threats of
death
I could tell of fiery deserts that have scorched me with their
breath
I could tell of wretched outcasts by the hundreds great and
small
And could claim the nasty honor of the greatest of them all

I could tell of toil and hardship and of sickness and disease
And holloweyed starvation but I tell you friend that these
Are trifles in comparison with what a fellow feels
With that bloodhound Remorsefulness forever at his heels

I rememberworn and weary of the long long years of care
When the frost of time was making early harvest of my hair
I remember wrecked and hopeless of a rest beneath the sky
My resolve to quit the country and to seek the East and die

I remember my long journey like a dull oppressive dream
Across the empty prairies till I caught the distant gleam
Of a city in the beauty of its broad and shining stream
On whose bosom flocked together float the mighty swans of
steam

I remember drifting with them till I found myself again
In the rush and roar and rattle of the engine and the train
And when from my surroundings something spoke of child and wife
It seemed the train was rumbling through a tunnel in my life

Then I remember somethinglike a sudden burst of light
That dont exactly tell it but I couldnt tell it right
A something clinging to me with its arms around my neck
A little girl for instanceor an angel I expect

For she kissed me cried and called me her dear papa and I
felt
My heart was pure virgin gold and just about to melt
And so it didit melted in a mist of gleaming rain
When she took my hand and whispered My mamas on the train

Theres some things I can dwell on and get off pretty well
But the balance of this story I know I couldnt tell
So I aint going to try it for to tell the reason why
Im so chickenhearted lately Id be certain most to cry


TIRED OUT

tired out Yet face and brow
Do not look aweary now
And the eyelids lie like two
Pure white roseleaves washed with dew
Was her life so hard a task
Strange that we forget to ask
What the lips now dumb for aye
Could have told us yesterday

Tired out A faded scrawl
Pinned upon the ragged shawl
Nothing else to leave a clue
Even of a friend or two
Who might come to fold the hands
Or smooth back the dripping strands
Of her tresses or to wet
Them anew with fond regret

Tired out We can but guess
Of her little happiness
Long ago in some fair land
When a lover held her hand
In the dream that frees us all
Soon or later from its thrall
Be it either false or true
We at last must tire too


HARLIE

Fold the little waxen hands
Lightly Let your warmest tears
Speak regrets but never fears
 Heaven understands
Let the sad heart oer the tomb
Lift again and burst in bloom
Fragrant with a prayer as sweet
As the lily at your feet

Bend and kiss the folded eyes
They are only feigning sleep
While their truant glances peep
 Into Paradise
See the face though cold and white
Holds a hint of some delight
Een with Death whose fingertips
Rest upon the frozen lips

When within the years to come
Vanished echoes live once more
Pattering footsteps on the floor
 And the sounds of home
Let your arms in fancy fold
Little Harlie as of old
As of old and as he waits
At the Citys golden gates


SAY SOMETHING TO ME

Say something to me Ive waited so long
 Waited and wondered in vain
Only a sentence would fall like a song
 Over this listening pain
Over a silence that glowers and frowns
 Even my pencil tonight
Slips in the dews of my sorrow and wounds
 Each tender word that I write

Say something to meif only to tell
 Me you remember the past
Let the sweet words like the notes of a bell
 Ring out my vigil at last
O it were better far better than this
 Doubt and distrust in the breast
For in the wine of a fanciful kiss
 I could taste Heaven andrest

Say something to me I kneel and I plead
 In my wild need for a word
If my poor heart from this silence were freed
 I could soar up like a bird
In the glad morning and twitter and sing
 Carol and warble and cry
Blithe as the lark as he cruises awing
 Over the deeps of the sky


LEONAINIE

LeonainieAngels named her
 And they took the light
Of the laughing stars and framed her
 In a smile of white
 And they made her hair of gloomy
 Midnight and her eyes of bloomy
 Moonshine and they brought her to me
 In the solemn night

In a solemn night of summer
 When my heart of gloom
Blossomed up to greet the comer
 Like a rose in bloom
 All forebodings that distressed me
 I forgot as Joy caressed me
 LYING Joy that caught and pressed me
 In the arms of doom

Only spake the little lisper
 In the Angeltongue
Yet I listening heard her whisper
 Songs are only sung
 Here below that they may grieve you
 Tales but told you to deceive you
 So must Leonainie leave you
 While her love is young

Then God smiled and it was morning
 Matchless and supreme
Heavens glory seemed adorning
 Earth with its esteem
 Every heart but mine seemed gifted
 With the voice of prayer and lifted
 Where my Leonainie drifted
 From me like a dream


A TEST OF LOVE

Now who shall say he loves me not

He wooed her first in an atmosphere
 Of tender and lowbreathed sighs
But the pang of her laugh went cutting clear
 To the soul of the enterprise
You beg so pert for the kiss you seek
 It reminds me John she said
Of a poodle pet that jumps to speak
 For a crumb or a crust of bread

And flashing up with the blush that flushed
 His face like a tableaulight
Came a bitter threat that his white lips hushed
 To a chill hoarsevoiced Good night
And again her laugh like a knell that tolled
 And a wideeyed mock surprise
Why John she said you have taken cold
 In the chill air of your sighs

And then he turned and with teeth tight clenched
 He told her he hated her
That his love for her from his heart he wrenched
 Like a corpse from a sepulcher
And then she called him a ghoul all red
 With the quintessence of crimes
But I know you love me now she said
 And kissed him a hundred times


FATHER WILLIAM

A NEW VERSION BY LEE O HARRIS AND JAMES
WHITCOMB RILEY

You are old Father William and though one would think
 All the veins in your body were dry
Yet the end of your nose is red as a pink
 I beg your indulgence but why

You see Father William replied in my youth
 Tis a thing I must ever regret
It worried me so to keep up with the truth
 That my nose has a flush on it yet

You are old said the youth and I grieve to detect
 A feverish gleam in your eye
Yet Im willing to give you full time to reflect
 Now pray can you answer me why

Alas said the sage I was tempted to choose
 Me a wife in my earlier years
And the grief when I think that she didnt refuse
 Has reddened my eyelids with tears

You are old Father William the young man said
 And you never touch wine you declare
Yet you sleep with your feet at the head of the bed
 Now answer me that if you dare

In my youth said the sage I was told it was true
 That the world turned around in the night
I cherished the lesson my boy and I knew
 That at morning my feet would be right

You are old said the youth and it grieved me to note
 As you recently fell through the door
That full as a goose had been chalked on your coat
 Now answer me that I implore

My boy said the sage I have answered you fair
 While you stuck to the point in dispute
But this is a personal matter and there
 Is my answerthe toe of my boot


WHAT THE WIND SAID

I muse today in a listless way
 In the gleam of a summer land
I close my eyes as a lover may
 At the touch of his sweethearts hand
And I hear these things in the whisperings
 Of the zephyrs round me fanned

I am the Wind and I rule mankind
 And I hold a sovereign reign
Over the lands as God designed
 And the waters they contain
Lo the bound of the wide world round
 Falleth in my domain

I was born on a stormy morn
 In a kingdom walled with snow
Whose crystal cities laugh to scorn
 The proudest the world can show
And the daylights glare is frozen there
 In the breath of the blasts that blow

Life to me was a jubilee
 From the first of my youthful days
Clinking my icy toys with glee
 Playing my childish plays
Filling my hands with the silver sands
 To scatter a thousand ways

Chasing the flakes that the Polar shakes
 From his shaggy coat of white
Or hunting the trace of the track he makes
 And sweeping it from sight
As he turned to glare from the slippery stair
 Of the icebergs farthest height

Till I grew so strong that I strayed ere long
 From my home of ice and chill
With an eager heart and a merry song
 I traveled the snows until
I heard the thaws in the icecrags jaws
 Crunched with a hungry will

And the angry crash of the waves that dash
 Themselves on the jagged shore
Where the splintered masts of the icewrecks flash
 And the frightened breakers roar
In wild unrest on the oceans breast
 For a thousand leagues or more

And the grand old sea invited me
 With a million beckoning hands
And I spread my wings for a flight as free
 As ever a sailor plans
When his thoughts are wild and his heart beguiled
 With the dreams of foreign lands

I passed a ship on its homeward trip
 With a weary and toilworn crew
And I kissed their flag with a welcome lip
 And so glad a gale I blew
That the sailors quaffed their grog and laughed
 At the work I made them do

I drifted by where seagroves lie
 Like brides in the fond caress
Of the warm sunshine and the tender sky
 Where the ocean passionless
And tranquil lies like a child whose eyes
 Are blurred with drowsiness

I drank the air and the perfume there
 And bathed in a fountains spray
And I smoothed the wings and the plumage rare
 Of a bird for his roundelay
And fluttered a rag from a signalcrag
 For a wretched castaway

With a seagull resting on my breast
 I launched on a madder flight
And I lashed the waves to a wild unrest
 And howled with a fierce delight
Till the daylight slept and I wailed and wept
 Like a fretful babe all night

For I heard the boom of a gun strike doom
 And the gleam of a bloodred star
Glared at me through the mirk and gloom
 From the lighthouse tower afar
And I held my breath at the shriek of death
 That came from the harbor bar

For I am the Wind and I rule mankind
 And I hold a sovereign reign
Over the lands as God designed
 And the waters they contain
Lo the bound of the wide world round
 Falleth in my domain

I journeyed on when the night was gone
 Oer a coast of oak and pine
And I followed a path that a stream had drawn
 Through a land of vale and vine
And here and there was a village fair
 In a nest of shade and shine

I passed oer lakes where the sunshine shakes
 And shivers his golden lance
On the glittering shield of the wave that breaks
 Where the fishboats dip and dance
And the trader sails where the mist unveils
 The glory of old romance

I joyed to stand where the jeweled hand
 Of the maidenmorning lies
On the tawny brow of the mountainland
 Where the eagle shrieks and cries
And holds his throne to himself alone
 From the light of human eyes

Adown deep glades where the forest shades
 Are dim as the dusk of day
Where only the foot of the wild beast wades
 Or the Indian dares to stray
As the blacksnakes glide through the reeds and hide
 In the swampdepths grim and gray

And I turned and fled from the place of dread
 To the faroff haunts of men
In the citys heart is rest I said
 But I found it not and when
I saw but care and vice reign there
 I was filled with wrath again

And I blew a spark in the midnight dark
 Till it flashed to an angry flame
And scarred the sky with a lurid mark
 As red as the blush of shame
And a hint of hell was the dying yell
 That up from the ruins came

The bells went wild and the black smoke piled
 Its pillars against the night
Till I gathered them like flocks defiled
 And scattered them left and right
While the holocausts red tresses tossed
 As a maddened Furys might

Ye overthrown did I jeer and groan
 Ho who is your mastersay
Ye shapes that writhe in the slag and moan
 Your slowcharred souls away
Ye worse than worst of things accurst
 Ye dead leaves of a day

I am the Wind and I rule mankind
 And I hold a sovereign reign
Over the lands as God designed
 And the waters they contain
Lo the bound of the wide world round
 Falleth in my domain

       

I wake as one from a dream half done
 And gaze with a dazzled eye
On an autumn leaf like a scrap of sun
 That the wind goes whirling by
While afar I hear with a chill of fear
 The winter stormking sigh


MORTON

The warm pulse of the nation has grown chill
 The muffled heart of Freedom like a knell
Throbs solemnly for one whose earthly will
 Wrought every mission well

Whose glowing reason towered above the sea
 Of dark disaster like a beacon light
And led the Ship of State unscathed and free
 Out of the gulfs of night

When Treason rabidmouthed and fanged with steel
 Lay growling oer the bones of fallen braves
And when beneath the tyrants iron heel
 Were ground the hearts of slaves

And War with all his train of horrors leapt
 Across the fortresswalls of Liberty
With havoc een the marble goddess wept
 With tears of blood to see

Throughout it all his brave and kingly mind
 Kept loyal vigil oer the patriots vow
And yet the flag he lifted to the wind
 Is drooping oer him now

And Peaceall pallid from the battlefield
 When first again it hovered oer the land
And found his voice above it like a shield
 Had nestled in his hand

        

O throne of State and gilded Senate halls
 Though thousands throng your aisles and galleries
How empty are ye and what silence falls
 On your hilarities

And yet though great the loss to us appears
 The consolation sweetens all our pain
Though hushed the voice through all the coming years
 Its echoes will remain


AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA

With a sweeter voice than birds
 Dare to twitter in their sleep
Pipe for me a tune of words
 Till my dancing fancies leap
Into freedom vaster far
Than the realms of Reason are
Sing for me with wilder fire
 Than the lover ever sung
From the time he twanged the lyre
 When the world was babyyoung

O my maiden Autumn you
You have filled me through and through
With a passion so intense
All of earthly eloquence
 Fails and falls and swoons away
In your presence Like as one
Who essays to look the sun
 Fairly in the face I say
Though my eyes you dazzle blind
Greater dazzled is my mind
So my Autumn let me kneel
 At your feet and worship you
Be my sweetheart let me feel
Your caress and tell me too
Why your smiles bewilder me
Glancing into laughter then
Trancing into calm again
Till your meaning drowning lies
In the dim depths of your eyes
Let me see the things you see
Down the depths of mystery
Blow aside the hazy veil
 From the daylight of your face
With the fragranceladened gale
 Of your spicy breath and chase
 Every dimple to its place
Lift your gipsy fingertips
To the roses of your lips
And fling down to me a bud
 But an unblown kissbut one
It shall blossom in my blood
 Even after life is done
When I dare to touch the brow
Your rare hair is veiling now
When the rich redgolden strands
Of the treasure in my hands
Shall be all of worldly worth
Heaven lifted from the earth
Like a banner to have set
On its highest minaret


THE ROSE

It tossed its head at the wooing breeze
 And the sun like a bashful swain
Beamed on it through the waving trees
 With a passion all in vain
For my rose laughed in a crimson glee
And hid in the leaves in wait for me

The honeybee came there to sing
 His love through the languid hours
And vaunt of his hives as a proud old king
 Might boast of his palacetowers
But my rose bowed in a mockery
And hid in the leaves in wait for me

The hummingbird like a courtier gay
 Dipped down with a dalliant song
And twanged his wings through the roundelay
 Of love the whole day long
Yet my rose turned from his minstrelsy
And hid in the leaves in wait for me

The firefly came in the twilight dim
 My red red rose to woo
Till quenched was the flame of love in him
 And the light of his lantern too
As my rose wept with dewdrops three
And hid in the leaves in wait for me

And I said I will cull my own sweet rose
 Some day I will claim as mine
The priceless worth of the flower that knows
 No change but a bloom divine
The bloom of a fadeless constancy
That hides in the leaves in wait for me

But time passed by in a strange disguise
 And I marked it not but lay
In a lazy dream with drowsy eyes
 Till the summer slipped away
And a chill wind sang in a minor key
Where is the rose that waits for thee

        

I dream today oer a purple stain
 Of bloom on a withered stalk
Pelted down by the autumn rain
 In the dust of the gardenwalk
That an Angelrose in the world to be
Will hide in the leaves in wait for me


THE MERMAN

I

Who would be
 A merman gay
 Singing alone
 Sitting alone
With a mermaids knee
 For instancehey
 For a throne

II

I would be a merman gay
 I would sit and sing the whole day long
I would fill my lungs with the strongest brine
 And squirt it up in a spray of song
And soak my head in my liquid voice
 Id curl my tail in curves divine
And let each curve in a kink rejoice
 Id tackle the mermaids under the sea
And yank em around till they yanked me
 Sportively sportively
And then we would wiggle away away
To the peagreen groves on the coast of day
 Chasing each other sportively

III

There would be neither moon nor star
But the waves would twang like a wet guitar
Low thunder and thrum in the darkness grum
 Neither moon nor star
We would shriek aloud in the dismal dales
Shriek at each other and squawk and squeal
 All night rakishly rakishly
They would pelt me with oysters and wiggletails
Laughing and clapping their hands at me
 All night prankishly prankishly
But I would toss them back in mine
Lobsters and turtles of quaint design
Then leaping out in an abrupt way
Id snatch them bald in my devilish glee
And skip away when they snatched at me
 Fiendishly fiendishly
O what a jolly life Id lead
Ah what a bangup life indeed
Soft are the mermaids under the sea
We would live merrily merrily


THE RAINY MORNING

The dawn of the day was dreary
 And the lowering clouds oerhead
Wept in a silent sorrow
 Where the sweet sunshine lay dead
And a wind came out of the eastward
 Like an endless sigh of pain
And the leaves fell down in the pathway
 And writhed in the falling rain

I had tried in a brave endeavor
 To chord my harp with the sun
But the strings would slacken ever
 And the task was a weary one
And so like a child impatient
 And sick of a discontent
I bowed in a shower of teardrops
 And mourned with the instrument

And lo as I bowed the splendor
 Of the sun bent over me
With a touch as warm and tender
 As a fathers hand might be
And even as I felt its presence
 My clouded soul grew bright
And the tears like the rain of morning
 Melted in mists of light


WE ARE NOT ALWAYS GLAD WHEN
WE SMILE

We are not always glad when we smile
 Though we wear a fair face and are gay
 And the world we deceive
 May not ever believe
 We could laugh in a happier way
Yet down in the deeps of the soul
 Ofttimes with our faces aglow
 Theres an ache and a moan
 That we know of alone
 And as only the hopeless may know

We are not always glad when we smile
 For the heart in a tempest of pain
 May live in the guise
 Of a smile in the eyes
 As a rainbow may live in the rain
And the stormiest night of our woe
 May hang out a radiant star
 Whose light in the sky
 Of despair is a lie
 As black as the thunderclouds are

We are not always glad when we smile
 But the conscience is quick to record
 All the sorrow and sin
 We are hiding within
 Is plain in the sight of the Lord
And ever O ever till pride
 And evasion shall cease to defile
 The sacred recess
 Of the soul we confess
 We are not always glad when we smile


A SUMMER SUNRISE

AFTER LEE O HARRIS

The masterhand whose pencils trace
 This wondrous landscape of the morn
Is but the sun whose glowing face
Reflects the rapture and the grace
 Of inspiration Heavenborn

And yet with visiondazzled eyes
 I see the lotuslands of old
Where odorous breezes fall and rise
And mountains peering in the skies
 Stand ankledeep in lakes of gold

And spangled with the shine and shade
 I see the rivers raveled out
In strands of silver slowly fade
In threads of light along the glade
 Where truant roses hide and pout

The tamarind on gleaming sands
 Droops drowsily beneath the heat
And bowed as though aweary stands
The stately palm with lazy hands
 That fold their shadows round his feet

And mistily as through a veil
 I catch the glances of a sea
Of sapphire dimpled with a gale
Toward Colchs blowing where the sail
 Of Jasons Argo beckons me

And gazing on and farther yet
 I see the isles enchanted bright
With fretted spire and parapet
And gilded mosque and minaret
 That glitter in the crimson light

But as I gaze the citys walls
 Are keenly smitten with a gleam
Of pallid splendor that appalls
The fancy as the ruin falls
 In ashen embers of a dream

Yet over all the waking earth
 The tears of night are brushed away
And eyes are lit with love and mirth
And benisons of richest worth
 Go up to bless the newborn day


DAS KRIST KINDEL

I had fed the fire and stirred it till the sparkles in delight
Snapped their saucy little fingers at the chill December night
And in dressinggown and slippers I had tilted back my
throne
The old splitbottomed rockerand was musing all alone

I could hear the hungry Winter prowling round the outer door
And the tread of muffled footsteps on the white piazza floor
But the sounds came to me only as the murmur of a stream
That mingled with the current of a lazyflowing dream

Like a fragrant incense rising curled the smoke of my cigar
With the lamplight gleaming through it like a mistenfolded
star
And as I gazed the vapor like a curtain rolled away
With a sound of bells that tinkled and the clatter of a sleigh

And in a vision painted like a picture in the air
I saw the elfish figure of a man with frosty hair
A quaint old man that chuckled with a laugh as he appeared
And with ruddy cheeks like embers in the ashes of his beard

He poised himself grotesquely in an attitude of mirth
On a damaskcovered hassock that was sitting on the hearth
And at a magic signal of his stubby little thumb
I saw the fireplace changing to a bright proscenium

And looking there I marveled as I saw a mimic stage
Alive with little actors of a very tender age
And some so very tiny that they tottered as they walked
And lisped and purled and gurgled like the brooklets when they
talked

And their faces were like lilies and their eyes like purest dew
And their tresses like the shadows that the shine is woven
through
And they each had little burdens and a little tale to tell
Of fairy lore and giants and delights delectable

And they mixed and intermingled weaving melody with joy
Till the magic circle clustered round a blooming babyboy
And they threw aside their treasures in an ecstacy of glee
And bent with dazzled faces and with parted lips to see

Twas a wondrous little fellow with a dainty doublechin
And chubby cheeks and dimples for the smiles to blossom in
And he looked as ripe and rosy on his bed of straw and reeds
As a mellow little pippin that had tumbled in the weeds

And I saw the happy mother and a group surrounding her
That knelt with costly presents of frankincense and myrrh
And I thrilled with awe and wonder as a murmur on the air
Came drifting oer the hearing in a melody of prayer

By the splendor in the heavens and the hush upon the sea
And the majesty of silence reigning over Galilee
We feel Thy kingly presence and we humbly bow the knee
And lift our hearts and voices in gratefulness to Thee

Thy messenger has spoken and our doubts have fled and gone
As the dark and spectral shadows of the night before the dawn
And in the kindly shelter of the light around us drawn
We would nestle down forever in the breast we lean upon

You have given us a shepherdYou have given us a guide
And the light of Heaven grew dimmer when You sent him from Your
side
But he comes to lead Thy children where the gates will open wide
To welcome his returning when his works are glorified

By the splendor in the heavens and the hush upon the sea
And the majesty of silence reigning over Galilee
We feel Thy kingly presence and we humbly bow the knee
And lift our hearts and voices in gratefulness to Thee

Then the vision slowly failing with the words of the refrain
Fell swooning in the moonlight through the frosty windowpane
And I heard the clock proclaiming like an eager sentinel
Who brings the world good tidingsIt is Christmasall is
well


AN OLD YEARS ADDRESS

I have twankled the strings of the twinkering rain
 I have burnished the meteors mail
 I have bridled the wind
 When he whinnied and whined
 With a bunch of stars tied to his tail
But my skyrocket hopes hanging over the past
Must fuzzle and fazzle and fizzle at last

I had waded far out in a drizzling dream
 And my fancies had spattered my eyes
 With a vision of dread
 With a number ten head
 And a form of diminutive size
That wavered and wagged in a singular way
As he wound himself up and proceeded to say

I have trimmed all my corns with the blade of the moon
 I have picked every tooth with a star
 And I thrill to recall
 That I went through it all
 Like a tune through a tickled guitar
I have ripped up the rainbow and raveled the ends
When the sun and myself were particular friends

And pausing again and producing a sponge
 And wiping the tears from his eyes
 He sank in a chair
 With a technical air
 That he struggled in vain to disguise
For a sigh that he breathed as I over him leant
Was haunted and hot with a peppermint scent

Alas he continued in quavering tones
 As a pang rippled over his face
 The life was too fast
 For the pleasure to last
 In my very unfortunate case
And Im goinghe said as he turned to adjust
A fuse in his bosomIm going toBUST

I shrieked and awoke with the sullen cheboom
 Of a fivepounder filling my ears
 And a roseate bloom
 Of a light in the room
 I saw through the mist of my tears
But my guest of the night never saw the display
He had fuzzled and fazzled and fizzled away


A NEW YEARS PLAINT

In words like weeds Ill wrap me oer
 Like coarsest clothes against the cold
 But that large grief which these enfold
Is given in outline and no more
 TENNYSON

The bells that lift their yawning throats
 And lolling tongues with wrangling cries
Flung up in harsh discordant notes
 As though in anger at the skies
Are filled with echoings replete
 With purest tinkles of delight
So I would have a something sweet
 Ring in the song I sing tonight

As when a blotch of ugly guise
 On some poor artists naked floor
Becomes a picture in his eyes
 And he forgets that he is poor
So I look out upon the night
 That ushers in the dawning year
And in a vacant blur of light
 I see these fantasies appear

I see a home whose windows gleam
 Like facets of a mighty gem
That some poor kings distorted dream
 Has fastened in his diadem
And I behold a throng that reels
 In revelry of dance and mirth
With hearts of love beneath their heels
 And in their bosoms hearts of earth

O Luxury as false and grand
 As in the mystic tales of old
When genii answered mans command
 And built of nothing halls of gold
O Banquet bright with pallid jets
 And tropic blooms and vases caught
In palms of naked statuettes
 Ye can not color as ye ought

For crouching in the storm without
 I see the figure of a child
In little ragged roundabout
 Who stares with eyes that never smiled
And he in fancy can but taste
 The dainties of the kingly fare
And pick the crumbs that go to waste
 Where none have learned to kneel in prayer

Go Pride and throw your goblet down
 The merry greeting best appears
On loving lips that never drown
 Its worth but in the wine of tears
Go close your coffers like your hearts
 And shut your hearts against the poor
Go strut through all your pretty parts
 But take the Welcome from your door


LUTHER BENSON

AFTER READING HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY

POOR victim of that vulture curse
That hovers oer the universe
With ready talons quick to strike
In every human heart alike
And cruel beak to stab and tear
In virtues vitals everywhere
You need no sympathy of mine
To aid you for a strength divine
Encircles you and lifts you clear
Above this earthly atmosphere

And yet I can but call you poor
As looking through the open door
Of your sad life I only see
A broad landscape of misery
And catch through mists of pitying tears
The ruins of your younger years
I see a fathers shielding arm
Thrown round you in a wild alarm
Struck down and powerless to free
Or aid you in your agony

I see a happy home grow dark
And desolatethe latest spark
Of hope is passing in eclipse
The prayer upon a mothers lips
Has fallen with her latest breath
In ashes on the lips of death
I see a penitent who reels
And writhes and clasps his hands and kneels
And moans for mercy for the sake
Of that fond heart he dared to break

And lo as when in Galilee
A voice above the troubled sea
Commanded Peace be still the flood
That rolled in tempestwaves of blood
Within you fell in calm so sweet
It ripples round the Saviours feet
And all your noble nature thrilled
With brightest hope and faith and filled
Your thirsty soul with joy and peace
And praise to Him who gave release


DREAM

Because her eyes were far too deep
And holy for a laugh to leap
Across the brink where sorrow tried
To drown within the amber tide
Because the looks whose ripples kissed
The trembling lids through tender mist
Were dazzled with a radiant gleam
Because of this I called her Dream

Because the roses growing wild
About her features when she smiled
Were ever dewed with tears that fell
With tenderness ineffable
Because her lips might spill a kiss
That dripping in a world like this
Would tincture deaths myrrhbitter stream
To sweetnessso I called her Dream

Because I could not understand
The magic touches of a hand
That seemed beneath her strange control
To smooth the plumage of the soul
And calm it till with folded wings
It half forgot its flutterings
And nestled in her palm did seem
To trill a song that called her Dream

Because I saw her in a sleep
As dark and desolate and deep
And fleeting as the taunting night
That flings a vision of delight
To some lorn martyr as he lies
In slumber ere the day he dies
Because she vanished like a gleam
Of glory do I call her Dream


WHEN EVENING SHADOWS FALL

When evening shadows fall
 She hangs her cares away
Like empty garments on the wall
 That hides her from the day
And while old memories throng
 And vanished voices call
She lifts her grateful heart in song
 When evening shadows fall

Her weary hands forget
 The burdens of the day
The weight of sorrow and regret
 In music rolls away
And from the days dull tomb
 That holds her in its thrall
Her soul springs up in lily bloom
 When evening shadows fall

O weary heart and hand
 Go bravely to the strife
No victory is half so grand
 As that which conquers life
One day shall yet be thine
 The day that waits for all
Whose prayerful eyes are things divine
 When evening shadows fall


YLLADMAR

Her hair was oh so dense a blur
Of darkness midnight envied her
And stars grew dimmer in the skies
To see the glory of her eyes
And all the summer rain of light
That showered from the moon at night
Fell oer her features as the gloom
Of twilight oer a lilybloom

The crimson fruitage of her lips
Was ripe and lush with sweeter wine
Than burgundy or muscadine
Or vintage that the burgher sips
In some old garden on the Rhine
And I to taste of it could well
Believe my heart a crucible
Of molten loveand I could feel
The drunken soul within me reel
And rock and stagger till it fell

And do you wonder that I bowed
Before her splendor as a cloud
Of storm the goldensandaled sun
Had set his conquering foot upon
And did she will it I could lie
In writhing rapture down and die
A death so full of precious pain
Id waken up to die again


A FANTASY

A fantasy that came to me
 As wild and wantonly designed
As ever any dream might be
 Unraveled from a madmans mind
A tanglework of tissue wrought
 By cunning of the spiderbrain
 And woven in an hour of pain
To trap the giddy flies of thought

I stood beneath a summer moon
 All swollen to uncanny girth
And hanging like the sun at noon
 Above the center of the earth
 But with a sad and sallow light
 As it had sickened of the night
And fallen in a pallid swoon
Around me I could hear the rush
 Of sullen winds and feel the whir
Of unseen wings apast me brush
 Like phantoms round a sepulcher
And like a carpeting of plush0
 A lawn unrolled beneath my feet
 Bespangled oer with flowers as sweet
 To look upon as those that nod
 Within the gardenfields of God
 But odorless as those that blow
 In ashes in the shades below

And on my hearing fell a storm
 Of gusty music sadder yet
 Than every whimper of regret
That sobbing utterance could form
 And patched with scraps of sound that seemed
 Torn out of tunes that demons dreamed
 And pitched to such a piercing key
 It stabbed the ear with agony
 And when at last it lulled and died
 I stood aghast and terrified
I shuddered and I shut my eyes
 And still could see and feel aware
 Some mystic presence waited there
And staring with a dazed surprise
 I saw a creature so divine
 That never subtle thought of mine
 May reproduce to inner sight
 So fair a vision of delight

A syllable of dew that drips
From out a lilys laughing lips
Could not be sweeter than the word
I listened to yet never heard
For oh the woman hiding there
Within the shadows of her hair
Spake to me in an undertone
So delicate my soul alone
But understood it as a moan
Of some weak melody of wind
A heavenward breeze had left behind

A tracery of trees grotesque
 Against the sky behind her seen
Like shapeless shapes of arabesque
 Wrought in an Oriental screen
And tall austere and statuesque
 She loomed before iteen as though
 The spirithand of Angelo
 Had chiseled her to life complete
 With chips of moonshine round her feet
And I grew jealous of the dusk
 To see it softly touch her face
 As loverlike with fond embrace
It folded round her like a husk
But when the glitter of her hand
 Like wasted glory beckoned me
 My eyes grew blurred and dull and dim
 My vision failedI could not see
I could not stirI could but stand
 Till quivering in every limb
 I flung me prone as though to swim
 The tide of grass whose waves of green
 Went rolling oceanwide between
 My helpless shipwrecked heart and her
 Who claimed me for a worshiper

And writhing thus in my despair
 I heard a weird unearthly sound
 That seemed to lift me from the ground
And hold me floating in the air
I looked and lo I saw her bow
 Above a harp within her hands
A crown of blossoms bound her brow
 And on her harp were twisted strands
Of silken starlight rippling oer
With music never heard before
By mortal ears and at the strain
I felt my Spirit snap its chain
And break awayand I could see
It as it turned and fled from me
To greet its mistress where she smiled
To see the phantom dancing wild
And wizardlike before the spell
Her mystic fingers knew so well


A DREAM

I dreamed I was a spider
A big fat hungry spider
A lusty rusty spider
 With a dozen palsied limbs
With a dozen limbs that dangled
Where three wretched flies were tangled
And their buzzing wings were strangled
 In the middle of their hymns

And I mocked them like a demon
A demoniacal demon
Who delights to be a demon
 For the sake of sin alone
And with fondly false embraces
Did I weave my mystic laces
Round their horrorstricken faces
 Till I muffled every groan

And I smiled to see them weeping
For to see an insect weeping
Sadly sorrowfully weeping
 Fattens every spiders mirth
And to note a flys heart quaking
And with anguish ever aching
Till you see it slowly breaking
 Is the sweetest thing on earth

I experienced a pleasure
Such a highlyflavored pleasure
Such intoxicating pleasure
 That I drank of it like wine
And my mortal soul engages
That no spider on the pages
Of the history of ages
 Felt a rapture more divine

I careened around and capered
Madly mystically capered
For three days and nights I capered
 Round my web in wild delight
Till with fierce ambition burning
And an inward thirst and yearning
I hastened my returning
 With a fiendish appetite

And I found my victims dying
Ha they whispered we are dying
Faintly whispered we are dying
 And our earthly course is run
And the scene was so impressing
That I breathed a special blessing
As I killed them with caressing
 And devoured them one by one


DREAMER SAY

Dreamer say will you dream for me
 A wild sweet dream of a foreign land
Whose border sips of a foaming sea
 With lips of coral and silver sand
Where warm winds loll on the shady deeps
 Or lave themselves in the tearful mist
The great wild wave of the breaker weeps
 Oer crags of opal and amethyst

Dreamer say will you dream a dream
 Of tropic shades in the lands of shine
Where the lily leans oer an amber stream
 That flows like a rill of wasted wine
Where the palmtrees lifting their shields of green
 Parry the shafts of the Indian sun
Whose splintering vengeance falls between
 The reeds below where the waters run

Dreamer say will you dream of love
 That lives in a land of sweet perfume
Where the stars drip down from the skies above
 In molten spatters of bud and bloom
Where never the weary eyes are wet
 And never a sob in the balmy air
And only the laugh of the paroquet
 Breaks the sleep of the silence there


BRYANT

The harp has fallen from the masters hand
Mute is the music voiceless are the strings
 Save such faint discord as the wild wind flings
In sad aeolian murmurs through the land
The tide of melody whose billows grand
 Flowed oer the world in clearest utterings
 Now in receding current sobs and sings
That song we never wholly understand
  O eyes where glorious prophecies belong
 And gracious reverence to humbly bow
And kingly spirit proud and pure and strong
 O pallid minstrel with the laureled brow
And lips so long attuned to sacred song
 How sweet must be the Heavenly anthem now


BABYHOOD

Heighho Babyhood Tell me where you linger
 Lets toddle home again for we have gone astray
Take this eager hand of mine and lead me by the finger
 Back to the lotuslands of the faraway

Turn back the leaves of lifeDont read the story
 Lets find the pictures and fancy all the rest
We can fill the written pages with a brighter glory
 Than old Time the storyteller at his very best

Turn to the brook where the honeysuckle tipping
 Oer its vase of perfume spills it on the breeze
And the bee and hummingbird in ecstacy are sipping
 From the fairy flagons of the blooming locusttrees

Turn to the lane where we used to teetertotter
 Printing little footpalms in the mellow mold
Laughing at the lazy cattle wading in the water
 Where the ripples dimple round the buttercups of gold

Where the dusky turtle lies basking on the gravel
 Of the sunny sandbar in the middle tide
And the ghostly dragonfly pauses in his travel
 To rest like a blossom where the waterlily died

Heighho Babyhood Tell me where you linger
 Lets toddle home again for we have gone astray
Take this eager hand of mine and lead me by the finger
 Back to the lotuslands of the faraway


LIBERTY

NEW CASTLE JULY 4 1878

For a hundred years the pulse of time
 Has throbbed for Liberty
For a hundred years the grand old clime
 Columbia has been free
 For a hundred years our countrys love
 The Stars and Stripes has waved above

Away far out on the gulf of years
 Misty and faint and white
Through the fogs of wronga sail appears
 And the Mayflower heaves in sight
 And drifts again with its little flock
 Of a hundred souls on Plymouth Rock

Do you see them thereas long long since
 Through the lens of History
Do you see them there as their chieftain prints
 In the snow his bended knee
 And lifts his voice through the wintry blast
 In thanks for a peaceful home at last

Though the skies are dark and the coast is bleak
 And the storm is wild and fierce
Its frozen flake on the upturned cheek
 Of the Pilgrim melts in tears
 And the dawn that springs from the darkness there
 Is the morning light of an answered prayer

The morning light of the day of Peace
 That gladdens the aching eyes
And gives to the soul that sweet release
 That the present verifies
 Nor a snow so deep nor a wind so chill
 To quench the flame of a freemans will

II

Days of toil when the bleeding hand
 Of the pioneer grew numb
When the untilled tracts of the barren land
 Where the weary ones had come
 Could offer nought from a fruitful soil
 To stay the strength of the strangers toil

Days of pain when the heart beat low
 And the empty hours went by
Pitiless with the wail of woe
 And the moan of Hungers cry
 When the trembling hands upraised in prayer
 Had only the strength to hold them there

Days when the voice of hope had fled
 Days when the eyes grown weak
Were folded to and the tears they shed
 Were frost on a frozen cheek
 When the storm bent down from the skies and gave
 A shroud of snow for the Pilgrims grave

Days at last when the smiling sun
 Glanced down from a summer sky
And a music rang where the rivers run
 And the waves went laughing by
 And the rose peeped over the mossy bank
 While the wild deer stood in the stream and drank

And the birds sang out so loud and good
 In a symphony so clear
And pure and sweet that the woodman stood
 With his ax upraised to hear
 And to shape the words of the tongue unknown
 Into a language all his own


 1

Sing every bird today
 Sing for the sky so clear
 And the gracious breath of the atmosphere
Shall waft our cares away
Sing sing for the sunshine free
Sing through the land from sea to sea
Lift each voice in the highest key
 And sing for Liberty


 2

Sing for the arms that fling
 Their fetters in the dust
 And lift their hands in higher trust
Unto the one Great King
Sing for the patriot heart and hand
Sing for the country they have planned
Sing that the world may understand
 This is Freedoms land


 3

Sing in the tones of prayer
 Sing till the soaring soul
 Shall float above the worlds control
In freedom everywhere
Sing for the good that is to be
Sing for the eyes that are to see
The land where man at last is free
 O sing for liberty

III

A holy quiet reigned save where the hand
Of labor sent a murmur through the land
And happy voices in a harmony
Taught every lisping breeze a melody
A nest of cabins where the smoke upcurled
A breathing incense to the other world
A land of languor from the sun of noon
That fainted slowly to the pallid moon
Till stars thickscattered in the gardenland
Of Heaven by the great Jehovahs hand
Had blossomed into light to look upon
The dusky warrior with his arrow drawn
As skulking from the covert of the night
With serpent cunning and a fiends delight
With murderous spirit and a yell of hate
The voice of Hell might tremble to translate
When the fond mothers tender lullaby
Went quavering in shrieks all suddenly
And babylips were dabbled with the stain
Of crimson at the bosom of the slain
And peaceful homes and fortunes ruinedlost
In smoldering embers of the holocaust
Yet on and on through years of gloom and strife
Our country struggled into stronger life
Till colonies like footprints in the sand
Marked Freedoms pathway winding through the land
And not the footprints to be swept away
Before the storm we hatched in Boston Bay
But footprints where the path of war begun
That led to Bunker Hill and Lexington
For he who dared to lead where others dared
To follow found the promise there declared
Of Liberty in blood of Freedoms host
Baptized to Father Son and Holy Ghost

Oh there were times when every patriot breast
Was riotous with sentiments expressed
In tones that swelled in volume till the sound
Of lusty war itself was wellnigh drowned
Oh those were times when happy eyes with tears
Brimmed oer as all the misty doubts and fears
Were washed away and Hope with gracious mien
Reigned from her throne again a sovereign queen
Until at last upon a day like this
When flowers were blushing at the summers kiss
And when the sky was cloudless as the face
Of some sweet infant in its angel grace
There came a sound of music thrown afloat
Upon the balmy aira clanging note
Reiterated from the brazen throat
Of Independence Bell A sound so sweet
The clamoring throngs of people in the streets
Were stilled as at the solemn voice of prayer
And heads were bowed and lips were moving there
That made no sounduntil the spell had passed
And then as when all sudden comes the blast
Of some tornado came the cheer on cheer
Of every eager voice while far and near
The echoing bells upon the atmosphere
Set glorious rumors floating till the ear
Of every listening patriot tingled clear
And thrilled with joy and jubilee to hear

 I

Stir all your echoes up
 O Independence Bell
And pour from your inverted cup
 The song we love so well

Lift high your happy voice
 And swing your iron tongue
Till syllables of praise rejoice
 That never yet were sung

Ring in the gleaming dawn
 Of FreedomToll the knell
Of Tyranny and then ring on
 O Independence Bell

Ring on and drown the moan
 Above the patriot slain
Till sorrows voice shall catch the tone
 And join the glad refrain

Ring out the wounds of wrong
 And rankle in the breast
Your music like a slumbersong
 Will lull revenge to rest

Ring out from Occident
 To Orient and peal
From continent to continent
 The mighty joy you feel

Ring Independence Bell
 Ring on till worlds to be
Shall listen to the tale you tell
 Of love and Liberty

IV

O Libertythe dearest word
A bleeding country ever heard
We lay our hopes upon thy shrine
And offer up our lives for thine
You gave us many happy years
Of peace and plenty ere the tears
A mourning country wept were dried
Above the graves of those who died
Upon thy threshold And again
When newer wars were bred and men
Went marching in the cannons breath
And died for thee and loved the death
While high above them gleaming bright
The dear old flag remained in sight
And lighted up their dying eyes
With smiles that brightened paradise
O Liberty it is thy power
To gladden us in every hour
Of gloom and lead us by thy hand
As little children through a land
Of bud and blossom while the days
Are filled with sunshine and thy praise
Is warbled in the roundelays
Of joyous birds and in the song
Of waters murmuring along
The paths of peace whose flowery fringe
Has roses finding deeper tinge
Of crimson looking on themselves
Reflectedleaning from the shelves
Of cliff and crag and mossy mound
Of emerald splendor shadowdrowned
We hail thy presence as you come
With bugle blast and rolling drum
And booming guns and shouts of glee
Commingled in a symphony
That thrills the worlds that throng to see
The glory of thy pageantry
0And with thy praise we breathe a prayer
That God who leaves you in our care
May favor us from this day on
With thy dear presencetill the dawn
Of Heaven breaking on thy face
Lights up thy first abiding place


TOM VAN ARDEN

Tom Van Arden my old friend
 Our warm fellowship is one
Far too old to comprehend
 Where its bond was first begun
 Miragelike before my gaze
 Gleams a land of other days
 Where two truant boys astray
 Dream their lazy lives away

Theres a vision in the guise
 Of Midsummer where the Past
Like a weary beggar lies
 In the shadow Time has cast
 And as blends the bloom of trees
 With the drowsy hum of bees
 Fragrant thoughts and murmurs blend
 Tom Van Arden my old friend

Tom Van Arden my old friend
 All the pleasures we have known
Thrill me now as I extend
 This old hand and grasp your own
 Feeling in the rude caress
 All affections tenderness
 Feeling though the touch be rough
 Our old souls are soft enough

So well make a mellow hour
 Fill your pipe and taste the wine
Warp your face if it be sour
 I can spare a smile from mine
 If it sharpen up your wit
 Let me feel the edge of it
 I have eager ears to lend
 Tom Van Arden my old friend

Tom Van Arden my old friend
 Are we lucky dogs indeed
Are we all that we pretend
 In the jolly life we lead
 Bachelors we must confess
 Boast of single blessedness
 To the world but not alone
 Mans best sorrow is his own

And the saddest truth is this
 Life to us has never proved
What we tasted in the kiss
 Of the women we have loved
 Vainly we congratulate
 Our escape from such a fate
 As their lying lips could send
 Tom Van Arden my old friend

Tom Van Arden my old friend
 Hearts like fruit upon the stem
Ripen sweetest I contend
 As the frost falls over them
 Your regard for me today
 Makes November taste of May
 And through every vein of rhyme
 Pours the blood of summertime

When our souls are cramped with youth
 Happiness seems far away
In the future while in truth

 We look back on it today
 Through our tears nor dare to boast
 Better to have loved and lost
 Broken hearts are hard to mend
 Tom Van Arden my old friend

Tom Van Arden my old friend
 I grow prosy and you tire
Fill the glasses while I bend
 To prod up the failing fire   
 You are restlessI presume
 Theres a dampness in the room
 Much of warmth our nature begs
 With rheumatics in our legs   

Humph the legs we used to fling
 Limberjointed in the dance
When we heard the fiddle ring
 Up the curtain of Romance
 And in crowded public halls
 Played with hearts like jugglers balls
 FEATS OF MOUNTEBANKS DEPEND
 Tom Van Arden my old friend

Tom Van Arden my old friend
 Pardon then this theme of mine
While the firelight leaps to lend
 Higher color to the wine
 I propose a health to those
 Who have HOMES and homes repose
 Wife and childlove without end
    Tom Van Arden my old friend
