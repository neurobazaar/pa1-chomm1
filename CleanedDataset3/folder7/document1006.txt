Cantos 1  33



CANTO I

Oer better waves to speed her rapid course
The light bark of my genius lifts the sail
Well pleasd to leave so cruel sea behind
And of that second region will I sing
In which the human spirit from sinful blot
Is purgd and for ascent to Heaven prepares

Here O ye hallowd Nine for in your train
I follow here the deadened strain revive
Nor let Calliope refuse to sound
A somewhat higher song of that loud tone
Which when the wretched birds of chattering note
Had heard they of forgiveness lost all hope

Sweet hue of eastern sapphire that was spread
Oer the serene aspect of the pure air
High up as the first circle to mine eyes
Unwonted joy renewd soon as I scapd
Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom
That had mine eyes and bosom filld with grief
The radiant planet that to love invites
Made all the orient laugh and veild beneath
The Pisces light that in his escort came

To the right hand I turnd and fixd my mind
On the other pole attentive where I saw
Four stars neer seen before save by the ken
Of our first parents Heaven of their rays
Seemd joyous O thou northern site bereft
Indeed and widowd since of these deprivd

As from this view I had desisted straight
Turning a little towrds the other pole
There from whence now the wain had disappeard
I saw an old man standing by my side
Alone so worthy of revrence in his look
That neer from son to father more was owd
Low down his beard and mixd with hoary white
Descended like his locks which parting fell
Upon his breast in double fold The beams
Of those four luminaries on his face
So brightly shone and with such radiance clear
Deckd it that I beheld him as the sun

Say who are ye that stemming the blind stream
Forth from th eternal prisonhouse have fled
He spoke and moved those venerable plumes
Who hath conducted or with lantern sure
Lights you emerging from the depth of night
That makes the infernal valley ever black
Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss
Broken or in high heaven new laws ordaind
That thus condemnd ye to my caves approach

My guide then laying hold on me by words
And intimations given with hand and head
Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay
Due reverence then thus to him replied

Not of myself I come a Dame from heaven
Descending had besought me in my charge
To bring But since thy will implies that more
Our true condition I unfold at large
Mine is not to deny thee thy request
This mortal neer hath seen the farthest gloom
But erring by his folly had approachd
So near that little space was left to turn
Then as before I told I was dispatchd
To work his rescue and no way remaind
Save this which I have taen I have displayd
Before him all the regions of the bad
And purpose now those spirits to display
That under thy command are purgd from sin
How I have brought him would be long to say
From high descends the virtue by whose aid
I to thy sight and hearing him have led
Now may our coming please thee In the search
Of liberty he journeys that how dear
They know who for her sake have life refusd
Thou knowest to whom death for her was sweet
In Utica where thou didst leave those weeds
That in the last great day will shine so bright
For us the eternal edicts are unmovd
He breathes and I am free of Minos power
Abiding in that circle where the eyes
Of thy chaste Marcia beam who still in look
Prays thee O hallowd spirit to own her shine
Then by her love we implore thee let us pass
Through thy sevn regions for which best thanks
I for thy favour will to her return
If mention there below thou not disdain

Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found
He then to him rejoind while I was there
That all she askd me I was fain to grant
Now that beyond the accursed stream she dwells
She may no longer move me by that law
Which was ordaind me when I issued thence
Not so if Dame from heaven as thou sayst
Moves and directs thee then no flattery needs
Enough for me that in her name thou ask
Go therefore now and with a slender reed
See that thou duly gird him and his face
Lave till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence
For not with eye by any cloud obscurd
Would it be seemly before him to come
Who stands the foremost minister in heaven
This islet all around there far beneath
Where the wave beats it on the oozy bed
Produces store of reeds No other plant
Coverd with leaves or hardend in its stalk
There lives not bending to the waters sway
After this way return not but the sun
Will show you that now rises where to take
The mountain in its easiest ascent

He disappeard and I myself upraisd
Speechless and to my guide retiring close
Toward him turnd mine eyes He thus began
My son observant thou my steps pursue
We must retreat to rearward for that way
The champain to its low extreme declines

The dawn had chasd the matin hour of prime
Which deaf before it so that from afar
I spyd the trembling of the ocean stream

We traversd the deserted plain as one
Who wanderd from his track thinks every step
Trodden in vain till he regain the path

When we had come where yet the tender dew
Strove with the sun and in a place where fresh
The wind breathd oer it while it slowly dried
Both hands extended on the watery grass
My master placd in graceful act and kind
Whence I of his intent before apprizd
Stretchd out to him my cheeks suffusd with tears
There to my visage he anew restord
That hue which the dun shades of hell conceald

Then on the solitary shore arrivd
That never sailing on its waters saw
Man that could after measure back his course
He girt me in such manner as had pleasd
Him who instructed and O strange to tell
As he selected every humble plant
Wherever one was pluckd another there
Resembling straightway in its place arose




CANTO II

Now had the sun to that horizon reachd
That covers with the most exalted point
Of its meridian circle Salems walls
And night that opposite to him her orb
Sounds from the stream of Ganges issued forth
Holding the scales that from her hands are droppd
When she reigns highest so that where I was
Auroras white and vermeiltincturd cheek
To orange turnd as she in age increasd

Meanwhile we lingerd by the waters brink
Like men who musing on their road in thought
Journey while motionless the body rests
When lo as near upon the hour of dawn
Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam
Glares down in west over the ocean floor
So seemd what once again I hope to view
A light so swiftly coming through the sea
No winged course might equal its career
From which when for a space I had withdrawn
Thine eyes to make inquiry of my guide
Again I lookd and saw it grown in size
And brightness thou on either side appeard
Something but what I knew not of bright hue
And by degrees from underneath it came
Another My preceptor silent yet
Stood while the brightness that we first discernd
Opend the form of wings then when he knew
The pilot cried aloud Down down bend low
Thy knees behold Gods angel fold thy hands
Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed

Lo how all human means he sets at naught
So that nor oar he needs nor other sail
Except his wings between such distant shores
Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them reard
Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes
That not like mortal hairs fall off or change

As more and more toward us came more bright
Appeard the bird of God nor could the eye
Endure his splendor near I mine bent down
He drove ashore in a small bark so swift
And light that in its course no wave it drank
The heavnly steersman at the prow was seen
Visibly written blessed in his looks

Within a hundred spirits and more there sat
In Exitu Israel de Aegypto
All with one voice together sang with what
In the remainder of that hymn is writ
Then soon as with the sign of holy cross
He blessd them they at once leapd out on land
The swiftly as he came returnd The crew
There left appeard astounded with the place
Gazing around as one who sees new sights

From every side the sun darted his beams
And with his arrowy radiance from mid heavn
Had chasd the Capricorn when that strange tribe
Lifting their eyes towards us If ye know
Declare what path will Lead us to the mount

Them Virgil answerd Ye suppose perchance
Us well acquainted with this place but here
We as yourselves are strangers Not long erst
We came before you but a little space
By other road so rough and hard that now
The ascent will seem to us as play The spirits
Who from my breathing had perceivd I livd
Grew pale with wonder As the multitude
Flock round a herald sent with olive branch
To hear what news he brings and in their haste
Tread one another down een so at sight
Of me those happy spirits were fixd each one
Forgetful of its errand to depart
Where cleansd from sin it might be made all fair

Then one I saw darting before the rest
With such fond ardour to embrace me I
To do the like was movd O shadows vain
Except in outward semblance thrice my hands
I claspd behind it they as oft returnd
Empty into my breast again Surprise
I needs must think was painted in my looks
For that the shadow smild and backward drew
To follow it I hastend but with voice
Of sweetness it enjoind me to desist
Then who it was I knew and prayd of it
To talk with me it would a little pause
It answered Thee as in my mortal frame
I lovd so loosd forth it I love thee still
And therefore pause but why walkest thou here

Not without purpose once more to return
Thou findst me my Casella where I am
Journeying this way I said but how of thee
Hath so much time been lost He answerd straight
No outrage hath been done to me if he
Who when and whom he chooses takes me oft
This passage hath denied since of just will
His will he makes These three months past indeed
He whose chose to enter with free leave
Hath taken whence I wandring by the shore
Where Tybers wave grows salt of him gaind kind
Admittance at that rivers mouth towrd which
His wings are pointed for there always throng
All such as not to Archeron descend

Then I If new laws have not quite destroyd
Memory and use of that sweet song of love
That while all my cares had power to swage
Please thee with it a little to console
My spirit that incumberd with its frame
Travelling so far of pain is overcome

Love that discourses in my thoughts He then
Began in such soft accents that within
The sweetness thrills me yet My gentle guide
And all who came with him so well were pleasd
That seemd naught else might in their thoughts have room

Fast fixd in mute attention to his notes
We stood when lo that old man venerable
Exclaiming How is this ye tardy spirits
What negligence detains you loitring here
Run to the mountain to cast off those scales
That from your eyes the sight of God conceal

As a wild flock of pigeons to their food
Collected blade or tares without their pride
Accustomd and in still and quiet sort
If aught alarm them suddenly desert
Their meal assaild by more important care
So I that newcome troop beheld the song
Deserting hasten to the mountains side
As one who goes yet where he tends knows not

Nor with less hurried step did we depart




CANTO III

Them sudden flight had scatterd over the plain
Turnd towrds the mountain whither reasons voice
Drives us I to my faithful company
Adhering left it not For how of him
Deprivd might I have sped or who beside
Would oer the mountainous tract have led my steps
He with the bitter pang of selfremorse
Seemd smitten O clear conscience and upright
How doth a little fling wound thee sore

Soon as his feet desisted slackning pace
From haste that mars all decency of act
My mind that in itself before was wrapt
Its thoughts expanded as with joy restord
And full against the steep ascent I set
My face where highest to heavn its top oerflows

The sun that flard behind with ruddy beam
Before my form was broken for in me
His rays resistance met I turnd aside
With fear of being left when I beheld
Only before myself the ground obscurd
When thus my solace turning him around
Bespake me kindly Why distrustest thou
Believst not I am with thee thy sure guide
It now is evening there where buried lies
The body in which I cast a shade removd
To Naples from Brundusiums wall Nor thou
Marvel if before me no shadow fall
More than that in the sky element
One ray obstructs not other To endure
Torments of heat and cold extreme like frames
That virtue hath disposd which how it works
Wills not to us should be reveald Insane
Who hopes our reason may that space explore
Which holds three persons in one substance knit
Seek not the wherefore race of human kind
Could ye have seen the whole no need had been
For Mary to bring forth Moreover ye
Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly
To whose desires repose would have been givn
That now but serve them for eternal grief
I speak of Plato and the Stagyrite
And others many more And then he bent
Downwards his forehead and in troubled mood
Broke off his speech Meanwhile we had arrivd
Far as the mountains foot and there the rock
Found of so steep ascent that nimblest steps
To climb it had been vain The most remote
Most wild untrodden path in all the tract
Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this
A ladder easy and open of access

Who knows on which hand now the steep declines
My master said and pausd so that he may
Ascend who journeys without aid of wine
And while with looks directed to the ground
The meaning of the pathway he explord
And I gazd upward round the stony height
Of spirits that toward us movd their steps
Yet moving seemd not they so slow approachd

I thus my guide addressd Upraise thine eyes
Lo that way some of whom thou mayst obtain
Counsel if of thyself thou findst it not

Straightway he lookd and with free speech replied
Let us tend thither they but softly come
And thou be firm in hope my son belovd

Now was that people distant far in space
A thousand paces behind ours as much
As at a throw the nervous arm could fling
When all drew backward on the messy crags
Of the steep bank and firmly stood unmovd
As one who walks in doubt might stand to look

O spirits perfect O already chosen
Virgil to them began by that blest peace
Which as I deem is for you all prepard
Instruct us where the mountain low declines
So that attempt to mount it be not vain
For who knows most him loss of time most grieves

As sheep that step from forth their fold by one
Or pairs or three at once meanwhile the rest
Stand fearfully bending the eye and nose
To ground and what the foremost does that do
The others gathring round her if she stops
Simple and quiet nor the cause discern
So saw I moving to advance the first
Who of that fortunate crew were at the head
Of modest mien and graceful in their gait
When they before me had beheld the light
From my right side fall broken on the ground
So that the shadow reachd the cave they stoppd
And somewhat back retird the same did all
Who followd though unweeting of the cause

Unaskd of you yet freely I confess
This is a human body which ye see
That the suns light is broken on the ground
Marvel not but believe that not without
Virtue derivd from Heaven we to climb
Over this wall aspire So them bespake
My master and that virtuous tribe rejoind
Turn and before you there the entrance lies
Making a signal to us with bent hands

Then of them one began Whoeer thou art
Who journeyst thus this way thy visage turn
Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen

I towrds him turnd and with fixd eye beheld
Comely and fair and gentle of aspect
He seemd but on one brow a gash was markd

When humbly I disclaimd to have beheld
Him ever Now behold he said and showd
High on his breast a wound then smiling spake

I am Manfredi grandson to the Queen
Costanza whence I pray thee when returnd
To my fair daughter go the parent glad
Of Aragonia and Sicilias pride
And of the truth inform her if of me
Aught else be told When by two mortal blows
My frame was shatterd I betook myself
Weeping to him who of free will forgives
My sins were horrible but so wide arms
Hath goodness infinite that it receives
All who turn to it Had this text divine
Been of Cosenzas shepherd better scannd
Who then by Clement on my hunt was set
Yet at the bridges head my bones had lain
Near Benevento by the heavy mole
Protected but the rain now drenches them
And the wind drives out of the kingdoms bounds
Far as the stream of Verde where with lights
Extinguishd he removd them from their bed
Yet by their curse we are not so destroyd
But that the eternal love may turn while hope
Retains her verdant blossoms True it is
That such one as in contumacy dies
Against the holy church though he repent
Must wander thirtyfold for all the time
In his presumption past if such decree
Be not by prayers of good men shorter made
Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss
Revealing to my good Costanza how
Thou hast beheld me and beside the terms
Laid on me of that interdict for here
By means of those below much profit comes




CANTO IV

When by sensations of delight or pain
That any of our faculties hath seizd
Entire the soul collects herself it seems
She is intent upon that power alone
And thus the error is disprovd which holds
The soul not singly lighted in the breast
And therefore when as aught is heard or seen
That firmly keeps the soul toward it turnd
Time passes and a man perceives it not
For that whereby he hearken is one power
Another that which the whole spirit hash
This is as it were bound while that is free

This found I true by proof hearing that spirit
And wondring for full fifty steps aloft
The sun had measurd unobservd of me
When we arrivd where all with one accord
The spirits shouted Here is what ye ask

A larger aperture ofttimes is stoppd
With forked stake of thorn by villager
When the ripe grape imbrowns than was the path
By which my guide and I behind him close
Ascended solitary when that troop
Departing left us On Sanleos road
Who journeys or to Noli low descends
Or mounts Bismantuas height must use his feet
But here a man had need to fly I mean
With the swift wing and plumes of high desire
Conducted by his aid who gave me hope
And with light furnishd to direct my way

We through the broken rock ascended close
Pent on each side while underneath the ground
Askd help of hands and feet When we arrivd
Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank
Where the plain level opend I exclaimd
O master say which way can we proceed

He answerd Let no step of thine recede
Behind me gain the mountain till to us
Some practisd guide appear That eminence
Was lofty that no eye might reach its point
And the side proudly rising more than line
From the mid quadrant to the centre drawn
I wearied thus began Parent belovd
Turn and behold how I remain alone
If thou stay not My son He straight replyd
Thus far put forth thy strength and to a track
Pointed that on this side projecting round
Circles the hill His words so spurrd me on
That I behind him clambring forcd myself
Till my feet pressd the circuit plain beneath
There both together seated turnd we round
To eastward whence was our ascent and oft
Many beside have with delight lookd back

First on the nether shores I turnd my eyes
Then raisd them to the sun and wondring markd
That from the left it smote us Soon perceivd
That Poet sage now at the car of light
Amazd I stood where twixt us and the north
Its course it enterd Whence he thus to me
Were Ledas offspring now in company
Of that broad mirror that high up and low
Imparts his light beneath thou mightst behold
The ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears
Wheel if its ancient course it not forsook
How that may be if thou wouldst think within
Pondring imagine Sion with this mount
Placd on the earth so that to both be one
Horizon and two hemispheres apart
Where lies the path that Phaeton ill knew
To guide his erring chariot thou wilt see
How of necessity by this on one
He passes while by that on the other side
If with clear view shine intellect attend

Of truth kind teacher I exclaimd so clear
Aught saw I never as I now discern
Where seemd my ken to fail that the mid orb
Of the supernal motion which in terms
Of art is called the Equator and remains
Ever between the sun and winter for the cause
Thou hast assignd from hence toward the north
Departs when those who in the Hebrew land
Inhabit see it towrds the warmer part
But if it please thee I would gladly know
How far we have to journey for the hill
Mounts higher than this sight of mine can mount

He thus to me Such is this steep ascent
That it is ever difficult at first
But more a man proceeds less evil grows
When pleasant it shall seem to thee so much
That upward going shall be easy to thee
As in a vessel to go down the tide
Then of this path thou wilt have reachd the end
There hope to rest thee from thy toil No more
I answer and thus far for certain know
As he his words had spoken near to us
A voice there sounded Yet ye first perchance
May to repose you by constraint be led
At sound thereof each turnd and on the left
A huge stone we beheld of which nor I
Nor he before was ware Thither we drew
find there were some who in the shady place
Behind the rock were standing as a man
Thru idleness might stand Among them one
Who seemd to me much wearied sat him down
And with his arms did fold his knees about
Holding his face between them downward bent

Sweet Sir I cryd behold that man who shows
Himself more idle than if laziness
Were sister to him Straight he turnd to us
And oer the thigh lifting his face observd
Then in these accents spake Up then proceed
Thou valiant one Straight who it was I knew
Nor could the pain I felt for want of breath
Still somewhat urgd me hinder my approach
And when I came to him he scarce his head
Uplifted saying Well hast thou discernd
How from the left the sun his chariot leads

His lazy acts and broken words my lips
To laughter somewhat movd when I began
Belacqua now for thee I grieve no more
But tell why thou art seated upright there
Waitest thou escort to conduct thee hence
Or blame I only shine accustomd ways
Then he My brother of what use to mount
When to my suffering would not let me pass
The bird of God who at the portal sits
Behooves so long that heavn first bear me round
Without its limits as in life it bore
Because I to the end repentant Sighs
Delayd if prayer do not aid me first
That riseth up from heart which lives in grace
What other kind avails not heard in heaven

Before me now the Poet up the mount
Ascending cried Haste thee for see the sun
Has touchd the point meridian and the night
Now covers with her foot Maroccos shore




CANTO V

Now had I left those spirits and pursued
The steps of my Conductor when beheld
Pointing the finger at me one exclaimd
See how it seems as if the light not shone
From the left hand of him beneath and he
As living seems to be led on Mine eyes
I at that sound reverting saw them gaze
Through wonder first at me and then at me
And the light broken underneath by turns
Why are thy thoughts thus riveted my guide
Exclaimd that thou hast slackd thy pace or how
Imports it thee what thing is whisperd here
Come after me and to their babblings leave
The crowd Be as a tower that firmly set
Shakes not its top for any blast that blows
He in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out
Still of his aim is wide in that the one
Sicklies and wastes to nought the others strength

What other could I answer save I come
I said it somewhat with that colour tingd
Which ofttimes pardon meriteth for man

Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came
A little way before us some who sang
The Miserere in responsive Strains
When they perceivd that through my body I
Gave way not for the rays to pass their song
Straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they changd
And two of them in guise of messengers
Ran on to meet us and inquiring askd
Of your condition we would gladly learn

To them my guide Ye may return and bear
Tidings to them who sent you that his frame
Is real flesh If as I deem to view
His shade they pausd enough is answerd them
Him let them honour they may prize him well

Neer saw I fiery vapours with such speed
Cut through the serene air at fall of night
Nor Augusts clouds athwart the setting sun
That upward these did not in shorter space
Return and there arriving with the rest
Wheel back on us as with loose rein a troop

Many exclaimd the bard are these who throng
Around us to petition thee they come
Go therefore on and listen as thou gost

O spirit who gost on to blessedness
With the same limbs that clad thee at thy birth
Shouting they came a little rest thy step
Look if thou any one amongst our tribe
Hast eer beheld that tidings of him there
Thou mayst report Ah wherefore gost thou on
Ah wherefore tarriest thou not We all
By violence died and to our latest hour
Were sinners but then warnd by light from heavn
So that repenting and forgiving we
Did issue out of life at peace with God
Who with desire to see him fills our heart

Then I The visages of all I scan
Yet none of ye remember But if aught
That I can do may please you gentle spirits
Speak and I will perform it by that peace
Which on the steps of guide so excellent
Following from world to world intent I seek

In answer he began None here distrusts
Thy kindness though not promisd with an oath
So as the will fail not for want of power
Whence I who sole before the others speak
Entreat thee if thou ever see that land
Which lies between Romagna and the realm
Of Charles that of thy courtesy thou pray
Those who inhabit Fano that for me
Their adorations duly be put up
By which I may purge off my grievous sins
From thence I came But the deep passages
Whence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt
Upon my bosom in Antenors land
Were made where to be more secure I thought
The author of the deed was Estes prince
Who more than right could warrant with his wrath
Pursued me Had I towards Mira fled
When overtaen at Oriaco still
Might I have breathd But to the marsh I sped
And in the mire and rushes tangled there
Fell and beheld my lifeblood float the plain

Then said another Ah so may the wish
That takes thee oer the mountain be fulfilld
As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine
Of Montefeltro I Buonconte I
Giovanna nor none else have care for me
Sorrowing with these I therefore go I thus
From Campaldinos field what force or chance
Drew thee that neer thy sepulture was known

Oh answerd he at Casentinos foot
A stream there courseth namd Archiano sprung
In Apennine above the Hermits seat
Een where its name is canceld there came I
Piercd in the heart fleeing away on foot
And bloodying the plain Here sight and speech
Faild me and finishing with Marys name
I fell and tenantless my flesh remaind
I will report the truth which thou again
Tell to the living Me Gods angel took
Whilst he of hell exclaimd O thou from heavn
Say wherefore hast thou robbd me Thou of him
Th eternal portion bearst with thee away
For one poor tear that he deprives me of
But of the other other rule I make

Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects
That vapour dank returning into water
Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it
That evil will which in his intellect
Still follows evil came and raisd the wind
And smoky mist by virtue of the power
Given by his nature Thence the valley soon
As day was spent he coverd oer with cloud
From Pratomagno to the mountain range
And stretchd the sky above so that the air
Impregnate changd to water Fell the rain
And to the fosses came all that the land
Containd not and as mightiest streams are wont
To the great river with such headlong sweep
Rushd that nought stayd its course My stiffend frame
Laid at his mouth the fell Archiano found
And dashd it into Arno from my breast
Loosning the cross that of myself I made
When overcome with pain He hurld me on
Along the banks and bottom of his course
Then in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt

Ah when thou to the world shalt be returnd
And rested after thy long road so spake
Next the third spirit then remember me
I once was Pia Sienna gave me life
Maremma took it from me That he knows
Who me with jewelld ring had first espousd


CANTO VI

When from their game of dice men separate
He who hath lost remains in sadness fixd
Revolving in his mind what luckless throws
He cast but meanwhile all the company
Go with the other one before him runs
And one behind his mantle twitches one
Fast by his side bids him remember him
He stops not and each one to whom his hand
Is stretchd well knows he bids him stand aside
And thus he from the press defends himself
Een such was I in that closecrowding throng
And turning so my face around to all
And promising I scapd from it with pains

Here of Arezzo him I saw who fell
By Ghinos cruel arm and him beside
Who in his chase was swallowd by the stream
Here Frederic Novello with his hand
Stretchd forth entreated and of Pisa he
Who put the good Marzuco to such proof
Of constancy Count Orso I beheld
And from its frame a soul dismissd for spite
And envy as it said but for no crime
I speak of Peter de la Brosse and here
While she yet lives that Lady of Brabant
Let her beware lest for so false a deed
She herd with worse than these When I was freed
From all those spirits who prayd for others prayers
To hasten on their state of blessedness
Straight I began O thou my luminary
It seems expressly in thy text denied
That heavens supreme decree can never bend
To supplication yet with this design
Do these entreat Can then their hope be vain
Or is thy saying not to me reveald

He thus to me Both what I write is plain
And these deceivd not in their hope if well
Thy mind consider that the sacred height
Of judgment doth not stoop because loves flame
In a short moment all fulfils which he
Who sojourns here in right should satisfy
Besides when I this point concluded thus
By praying no defect could be supplied
Because the prayr had none access to God
Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not
Contented unless she assure thee so
Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light
I know not if thou take me right I mean
Beatrice Her thou shalt behold above
Upon this mountains crown fair seat of joy

Then I Sir let us mend our speed for now
I tire not as before and lo the hill
Stretches its shadow far He answerd thus
Our progress with this day shall be as much
As we may now dispatch but otherwise
Than thou supposest is the truth For there
Thou canst not be ere thou once more behold
Him back returning who behind the steep
Is now so hidden that as erst his beam
Thou dost not break But lo a spirit there
Stands solitary and toward us looks
It will instruct us in the speediest way

We soon approachd it O thou Lombard spirit
How didst thou stand in high abstracted mood
Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes
It spoke not aught but let us onward pass
Eyeing us as a lion on his watch
But Virgil with entreaty mild advancd
Requesting it to show the best ascent
It answer to his question none returnd
But of our country and our kind of life
Demanded When my courteous guide began
Mantua the solitary shadow quick
Rose towards us from the place in which it stood
And cryd Mantuan I am thy countryman
Sordello Each the other then embracd

Ah slavish Italy thou inn of grief
Vessel without a pilot in loud storm
Lady no longer of fair provinces
But brothelhouse impure this gentle spirit
Evn from the Pleasant sound of his dear land
Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen
With such glad cheer while now thy living ones
In thee abide not without war and one
Malicious gnaws another ay of those
Whom the same wall and the same moat contains
Seek wretched one around thy seacoasts wide
Then homeward to thy bosom turn and mark
If any part of the sweet peace enjoy
What boots it that thy reins Justinians hand
Befitted if thy saddle be unpressd
Nought doth he now but aggravate thy shame
Ah people thou obedient still shouldst live
And in the saddle let thy Caesar sit
If well thou markedst that which God commands

Look how that beast to felness hath relapsd
From having lost correction of the spur
Since to the bridle thou hast set thine hand
O German Albert who abandonst her
That is grown savage and unmanageable
When thou shouldst clasp her flanks with forked heels
Just judgment from the stars fall on thy blood
And be it strange and manifest to all
Such as may strike thy successor with dread
For that thy sire and thou have sufferd thus
Through greediness of yonder realms detaind
The garden of the empire to run waste
Come see the Capulets and Montagues
The Philippeschi and Monaldi man
Who carst for nought those sunk in grief and these
With dire suspicion rackd Come cruel one
Come and behold the oppression of the nobles
And mark their injuries and thou mayst see
What safety Santafiore can supply
Come and behold thy Rome who calls on thee
Desolate widow day and night with moans
My Caesar why dost thou desert my side
Come and behold what love among thy people
And if no pity touches thee for us
Come and blush for thine own report For me
If it be lawful O Almighty Power
Who wast in earth for our sakes crucified
Are thy just eyes turnd elsewhere or is this
A preparation in the wondrous depth
Of thy sage counsel made for some good end
Entirely from our reach of thought cut off
So are the Italian cities all oerthrongd
With tyrants and a great Marcellus made
Of every petty factious villager

My Florence thou mayst well remain unmovd
At this digression which affects not thee
Thanks to thy people who so wisely speed
Many have justice in their heart that long
Waiteth for counsel to direct the bow
Or ere it dart unto its aim but shine
Have it on their lips edge Many refuse
To bear the common burdens readier thine
Answer unealld and cry Behold I stoop

Make thyself glad for thou hast reason now
Thou wealthy thou at peace thou wisdomfraught
Facts best witness if I speak the truth
Athens and Lacedaemon who of old
Enacted laws for civil arts renownd
Made little progress in improving life
Towrds thee who usest such nice subtlety
That to the middle of November scarce
Reaches the thread thou in October weavst
How many times within thy memory
Customs and laws and coins and offices
Have been by thee renewd and people changd

If thou rememberst well and canst see clear
Thou wilt perceive thyself like a sick wretch
Who finds no rest upon her down but oft
Shifting her side short respite seeks from pain




CANTO VII

After their courteous greetings joyfully
Sevn times exchangd Sordello backward drew
Exclaiming Who are ye Before this mount
By spirits worthy of ascent to God
Was sought my bones had by Octavius care
Been buried I am Virgil for no sin
Deprivd of heavn except for lack of faith

So answerd him in few my gentle guide

As one who aught before him suddenly
Beholding whence his wonder riseth cries
It is yet is not wavring in belief
Such he appeard then downward bent his eyes
And drawing near with reverential step
Caught him where of mean estate might clasp
His lord Glory of Latium he exclaimd
In whom our tongue its utmost power displayd
Boast of my honord birthplace what desert
Of mine what favour rather undeservd
Shows thee to me If I to hear that voice
Am worthy say if from below thou comst
And from what cloisters paleThrough every orb
Of that sad region he replyd thus far
Am I arrivd by heavnly influence led
And with such aid I come There is a place
There underneath not made by torments sad
But by dun shades alone where mournings voice
Sounds not of anguish sharp but breathes in sighs

There I with little innocents abide
Who by deaths fangs were bitten ere exempt
From human taint There I with those abide
Who the three holy virtues put not on
But understood the rest and without blame
Followd them all But if thou knowst and canst
Direct us how we soonest may arrive
Where Purgatory its true beginning takes

He answerd thus We have no certain place
Assignd us upwards I may go or round
Far as I can I join thee for thy guide
But thou beholdest now how day declines
And upwards to proceed by night our power
Excels therefore it may be well to choose
A place of pleasant sojourn To the right
Some spirits sit apart retird If thou
Consentest I to these will lead thy steps
And thou wilt know them not without delight

How chances this was answerd who so wishd
To ascend by night would he be thence debarrd
By other or through his own weakness fail

The good Sordello then along the ground
Trailing his finger spoke Only this line
Thou shalt not overpass soon as the sun
Hath disappeard not that aught else impedes
Thy going upwards save the shades of night
These with the wont of power perplex the will
With them thou haply mightst return beneath
Or to and fro around the mountains side
Wander while day is in the horizon shut

My master straight as wondring at his speech
Exclaimd Then lead us quickly where thou sayst
That while we stay we may enjoy delight

A little space we were removd from thence
When I perceivd the mountain hollowd out
Evn as large valleys hollowd out on earth

That way the escorting spirit cried we go
Where in a bosom the high bank recedes
And thou await renewal of the day

Betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path
Led us traverse into the ridges side
Where more than half the sloping edge expires
Refulgent gold and silver thrice refind
And scarlet grain and ceruse Indian wood
Of lucid dye serene fresh emeralds
But newly broken by the herbs and flowers
Placd in that fair recess in color all
Had been surpassd as great surpasses less
Nor nature only there lavishd her hues
But of the sweetness of a thousand smells
A rare and undistinguishd fragrance made

Salve Regina on the grass and flowers
Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit
Who not beyond the valley could be seen

Before the westring sun sink to his bed
Began the Mantuan who our steps had turnd

Mid those desires not that I lead ye on
For from this eminence ye shall discern
Better the acts and visages of all
Than in the nether vale among them mixd
He who sits high above the rest and seems
To have neglected that he should have done
And to the others song moves not his lip
The Emperor Rodolph call who might have heald
The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died
So that by others she revives but slowly
He who with kindly visage comforts him
Swayd in that country where the water springs
That Moldaws river to the Elbe and Elbe
Rolls to the ocean Ottocar his name
Who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth
Than Winceslaus his son a bearded man
Pamperd with rank luxuriousness and ease
And that one with the nose depress who close
In counsel seems with him of gentle look
Flying expird withring the lilys flower
Look there how he doth knock against his breast
The other ye behold who for his cheek
Makes of one hand a couch with frequent sighs
They are the father and the fatherinlaw
Of Gallias bane his vicious life they know
And foul thence comes the grief that rends them thus

He so robust of limb who measure keeps
In song with him of feature prominent
With evry virtue bore his girdle bracd
And if that stripling who behinds him sits
King after him had livd his virtue then
From vessel to like vessel had been pourd
Which may not of the other heirs be said
By James and Frederick his realms are held
Neither the better heritage obtains
Rarely into the branches of the tree
Doth human worth mount up and so ordains
He who bestows it that as his free gift
It may be calld To Charles my words apply
No less than to his brother in the song
Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess
So much that plant degenerates from its seed
As more than Beatrice and Margaret
Costanza still boasts of her valorous spouse

Behold the king of simple life and plain
Harry of England sitting there alone
He through his branches better issue spreads

That one who on the ground beneath the rest
Sits lowest yet his gaze directs aloft
Us William that brave Marquis for whose cause
The deed of Alexandria and his war
Makes Conferrat and Canavese weep




CANTO VIII

Now was the hour that wakens fond desire
In men at sea and melts their thoughtful heart
Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell
And pilgrim newly on his road with love
Thrills if he hear the vesper bell from far
That seems to mourn for the expiring day
When I no longer taking heed to hear
Began with wonder from those spirits to mark
One risen from its seat which with its hand
Audience implord Both palms it joind and raisd
Fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east
As telling God I care for naught beside

Te Lucis Ante so devoutly then
Came from its lip and in so soft a strain
That all my sense in ravishment was lost
And the rest after softly and devout
Followd through all the hymn with upward gaze
Directed to the bright supernal wheels

Here reader for the truth makes thine eyes keen
For of so subtle texture is this veil
That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmarkd

I saw that gentle band silently next
Look up as if in expectation held
Pale and in lowly guise and from on high
I saw forth issuing descend beneath
Two angels with two flameillumind swords
Broken and mutilated at their points
Green as the tender leaves but newly born
Their vesture was the which by wings as green
Beaten they drew behind them fannd in air
A little over us one took his stand
The other lighted on the Opposing hill
So that the troop were in the midst containd

Well I descried the whiteness on their heads
But in their visages the dazzled eye
Was lost as faculty that by too much
Is overpowerd From Marys bosom both
Are come exclaimd Sordello as a guard
Over the vale ganst him who hither tends
The serpent Whence not knowing by which path
He came I turnd me round and closely pressd
All frozen to my leaders trusted side

Sordello pausd not To the valley now
For it is time let us descend and hold
Converse with those great shadows haply much
Their sight may please ye Only three steps down
Methinks I measurd ere I was beneath
And noted one who lookd as with desire
To know me Time was now that air arrow dim
Yet not so dim that twixt his eyes and mine
It cleard not up what was conceald before
Mutually towrds each other we advancd
Nino thou courteous judge what joy I felt
When I perceivd thou wert not with the bad

No salutation kind on either part
Was left unsaid He then inquird How long
Since thou arrivedst at the mountains foot
Over the distant wavesO answerd I
Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came
And still in my first life thus journeying on
The other strive to gain Soon as they heard
My words he and Sordello backward drew
As suddenly amazd To Virgil one
The other to a spirit turnd who near
Was seated crying Conrad up with speed
Come see what of his grace high God hath willd
Then turning round to me By that rare mark
Of honour which thou owst to him who hides
So deeply his first cause it hath no ford
When thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves
Tell my Giovanna that for me she call
There where reply to innocence is made
Her mother I believe loves me no more
Since she has changd the white and wimpled folds
Which she is doomd once more with grief to wish
By her it easily may be perceivd
How long in women lasts the flame of love
If sight and touch do not relume it oft
For her so fair a burial will not make
The viper which calls Milan to the field
As had been made by shrill Galluras bird

He spoke and in his visage took the stamp
Of that right seal which with due temperature
Glows in the bosom My insatiate eyes
Meanwhile to heavn had traveld even there
Where the bright stars are slowest as a wheel
Nearest the axle when my guide inquird
What there aloft my son has caught thy gaze

I answerd The three torches with which here
The pole is all on fire He then to me
The four resplendent stars thou sawst this morn
Are there beneath and these risn in their stead

While yet he spoke Sordello to himself
Drew him and cryd Lo there our enemy
And with his hand pointed that way to look

Along the side where barrier none arose
Around the little vale a serpent lay
Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food
Between the grass and flowers the evil snake
Came on reverting oft his lifted head
And as a beast that smoothes its polishd coat
Licking his hack I saw not nor can tell
How those celestial falcons from their seat
Movd but in motion each one well descried
Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes
The serpent fled and to their stations back
The angels up returnd with equal flight

The Spirit who to Nino when he calld
Had come from viewing me with fixed ken
Through all that conflict loosend not his sight

So may the lamp which leads thee up on high
Find in thy destind lot of wax so much
As may suffice thee to the enamels height
It thus began If any certain news
Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part
Thou knowst tell me who once was mighty there
They calld me Conrad Malaspina not
That old one but from him I sprang The love
I bore my people is now here refind

In your dominions I answerd neer was I
But through all Europe where do those men dwell
To whom their glory is not manifest
The fame that honours your illustrious house
Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land
So that he knows it who was never there
I swear to you so may my upward route
Prosper your honourd nation not impairs
The value of her coffer and her sword
Nature and use give her such privilege
That while the world is twisted from his course
By a bad head she only walks aright
And has the evil way in scorn He then
Now pass thee on sevn times the tired sun
Revisits not the couch which with four feet
The forked Aries covers ere that kind
Opinion shall be naild into thy brain
With stronger nails than others speech can drive
If the sure course of judgment be not stayd




CANTO IX

Now the fair consort of Tithonus old
Arisen from her mates beloved arms
Lookd palely oer the eastern cliff her brow
Lucent with jewels glitterd set in sign
Of that chill animal who with his train
Smites fearful nations and where then we were
Two steps of her ascent the night had past
And now the third was closing up its wing
When I who had so much of Adam with me
Sank down upon the grass oercome with sleep
There where all five were seated In that hour
When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay
Remembring haply ancient grief renews
And with our minds more wandrers from the flesh
And less by thought restraind are as t were full
Of holy divination in their dreams
Then in a vision did I seem to view
A goldenfeatherd eagle in the sky
With open wings and hovring for descent
And I was in that place methought from whence
Young Ganymede from his associates reft
Was snatchd aloft to the high consistory
Perhaps thought I within me here alone
He strikes his quarry and elsewhere disdains
To pounce upon the prey Therewith it seemd
A little wheeling in his airy tour
Terrible as the lightning rushd he down
And snatchd me upward even to the fire

There both I thought the eagle and myself
Did burn and so intense th imagind flames
That needs my sleep was broken off As erst
Achilles shook himself and round him rolld
His wakend eyeballs wondring where he was
Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled
To Scyros with him sleeping in her arms
Een thus I shook me soon as from my face
The slumber parted turning deadly pale
Like one icestruck with dread Solo at my side
My comfort stood and the bright sun was now
More than two hours aloft and to the sea
My looks were turnd Fear not my master cried
Assurd we are at happy point Thy strength
Shrink not but rise dilated Thou art come
To Purgatory now Lo there the cliff
That circling bounds it Lo the entrance there
Where it doth seem disparted re the dawn
Usherd the daylight when thy wearied soul
Slept in thee oer the flowery vale beneath
A lady came and thus bespake me I
Am Lucia Suffer me to take this man
Who slumbers Easier so his way shall speed
Sordello and the other gentle shapes
Tarrying she bare thee up and as day shone
This summit reachd and I pursued her steps
Here did she place thee First her lovely eyes
That open entrance showd me then at once
She vanishd with thy sleep Like one whose doubts
Are chasd by certainty and terror turnd
To comfort on discovery of the truth
Such was the change in me and as my guide
Beheld me fearless up along the cliff
He movd and I behind him towards the height

Reader thou markest how my theme doth rise
Nor wonder therefore if more artfully
I prop the structure nearer now we drew
Arrivd whence in that part where first a breach
As of a wall appeard I could descry
A portal and three steps beneath that led
For inlet there of different colour each
And one who watchd but spake not yet a word
As more and more mine eye did stretch its view
I markd him seated on the highest step
In visage such as past my power to bear

Graspd in his hand a naked sword glancd back
The rays so toward me that I oft in vain
My sight directed Speak from whence ye stand
He cried What would ye Where is your escort
Take heed your coming upward harm ye not

A heavenly dame not skilless of these things
Replied the instructor told us even now
Pass that way here the gate is And may she
Befriending prosper your ascent resumd
The courteous keeper of the gate Come then
Before our steps We straightway thither came

The lowest stair was marble white so smooth
And polishd that therein my mirrord form
Distinct I saw The next of hue more dark
Than sablest grain a rough and singed block
Crackd lengthwise and across The third that lay
Massy above seemd porphyry that flamd
Red as the lifeblood spouting from a vein
On this Gods angel either foot sustaind
Upon the threshold seated which appeard
A rock of diamond Up the trinal steps
My leader cheerily drew me Ask said he

With humble heart that he unbar the bolt

Piously at his holy feet devolvd
I cast me praying him for pitys sake
That he would open to me but first fell
Thrice on my bosom prostrate Seven times
The letter that denotes the inward stain
He on my forehead with the blunted point
Of his drawn sword inscribd And Look he cried
When enterd that thou wash these scars away

Ashes or earth taen dry out of the ground
Were of one colour with the robe he wore
From underneath that vestment forth he drew
Two keys of metal twain the one was gold
Its fellow silver With the pallid first
And next the burnishd he so plyd the gate
As to content me well Whenever one
Faileth of these that in the keyhole straight
It turn not to this alley then expect
Access in vain Such were the words he spake
One is more precious but the other needs
Skill and sagacity large share of each
Ere its good task to disengage the knot
Be worthily performd From Peter these
I hold of him instructed that I err
Rather in opening than in keeping fast
So but the suppliant at my feet implore

Then of that hallowd gate he thrust the door
Exclaiming Enter but this warning hear
He forth again departs who looks behind

As in the hinges of that sacred ward
The swivels turnd sonorous metal strong
Harsh was the grating nor so surlily
Roard the Tarpeian when by force bereft
Of good Metellus thenceforth from his loss
To leanness doomd Attentively I turnd
Listning the thunder that first issued forth
And We praise thee O God methought I heard
In accents blended with sweet melody
The strains came oer mine ear een as the sound
Of choral voices that in solemn chant
With organ mingle and now high and clear
Come swelling now float indistinct away




CANTO X

When we had passed the threshold of the gate
Which the souls ill affection doth disuse
Making the crooked seem the straighter path
I heard its closing sound Had mine eyes turnd
For that offence what plea might have availd

We mounted up the riven rock that wound
On either side alternate as the wave
Flies and advances Here some little art
Behooves us said my leader that our steps
Observe the varying flexure of the path

Thus we so slowly sped that with cleft orb
The moon once more oerhangs her watry couch
Ere we that strait have threaded But when free
We came and open where the mount above
One solid mass retires I spent with toil
And both uncertain of the way we stood
Upon a plain more lonesome than the roads
That traverse desert wilds From whence the brink
Borders upon vacuity to foot
Of the steep bank that rises still the space
Had measurd thrice the stature of a man
And distant as mine eye could wing its flight
To leftward now and now to right dispatchd
That cornice equal in extent appeard

Not yet our feet had on that summit movd
When I discoverd that the bank around
Whose proud uprising all ascent denied
Was marble white and so exactly wrought
With quaintest sculpture that not there alone
Had Polycletus but een natures self
Been shamd The angel who came down to earth
With tidings of the peace so many years
Wept for in vain that opd the heavenly gates
From their long interdict before us seemd
In a sweet act so sculpturd to the life
He lookd no silent image One had sworn
He had said Hail for she was imagd there
By whom the key did open to Gods love
And in her act as sensibly impress
That word Behold the handmaid of the Lord
As figure seald on wax Fix not thy mind
On one place only said the guide belovd
Who had me near him on that part where lies
The heart of man My sight forthwith I turnd
And markd behind the virgin mothers form
Upon that side where he that movd me stood
Another story graven on the rock

I passed athwart the bard and drew me near
That it might stand more aptly for my view
There in the selfsame marble were engravd
The cart and kine drawing the sacred ark
That from unbidden office awes mankind
Before it came much people and the whole
Parted in seven quires One sense cried Nay
Another Yes they sing Like doubt arose
Betwixt the eye and smell from the curld fume
Of incense breathing up the wellwrought toil
Preceding the blest vessel onward came
With light dance leaping girt in humble guise
Sweet Israels harper in that hap he seemd
Less and yet more than kingly Opposite
At a great palace from the lattice forth
Lookd Michol like a lady full of scorn
And sorrow To behold the tablet next
Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone
I movd me There was storied on the rock
The exalted glory of the Roman prince
Whose mighty worth movd Gregory to earn
His mighty conquest Trajan th Emperor
A widow at his bridle stood attird
In tears and mourning Round about them troopd
Full throng of knights and overhead in gold
The eagles floated struggling with the wind

The wretch appeard amid all these to say
Grant vengeance sire for woe beshrew this heart
My son is murderd He replying seemd

Wait now till I return And she as one
Made hasty by her grief O sire if thou
Dost not returnWhere I am who then is
May right theeWhat to thee is others good
If thou neglect thy ownNow comfort thee
At length he answers It beseemeth well
My duty be performd ere I move hence
So justice wills and pity bids me stay

He whose ken nothing new surveys producd
That visible speaking new to us and strange
The like not found on earth Fondly I gazd
Upon those patterns of meek humbleness
Shapes yet more precious for their artists sake
When Lo the poet whisperd where this way
But slack their pace a multitude advance
These to the lofty steps shall guide us on

Mine eyes though bent on view of novel sights
Their lovd allurement were not slow to turn

Reader would not that amazd thou miss
Of thy good purpose hearing how just God
Decrees our debts be canceld Ponder not
The form of suffring Think on what succeeds
Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom
It cannot pass Instructor I began
What I see hither tending bears no trace
Of human semblance nor of aught beside
That my foild sight can guess He answering thus
So courbd to earth beneath their heavy teems
Of torment stoop they that mine eye at first
Struggled as thine But look intently thither
An disentangle with thy labring view
What underneath those stones approacheth now
Een now mayst thou discern the pangs of each

Christians and proud poor and wretched ones
That feeble in the minds eye lean your trust
Upon unstaid perverseness now ye not
That we are worms yet made at last to form
The winged insect impd with angel plumes
That to heavens justice unobstructed soars
Why buoy ye up aloft your unflegd souls
Abortive then and shapeless ye remain
Like the untimely embryon of a worm

As to support incumbent floor or roof
For corbel is a figure sometimes seen
That crumples up its knees unto its breast
With the feignd posture stirring ruth unfeignd
In the beholders fancy so I saw
These fashiond when I noted well their guise

Each as his back was laden came indeed
Or more or less contract but it appeard
As he who showd most patience in his look
Wailing exclaimd I can endure no more




CANTO XI

O thou Almighty Father who dost make
The heavens thy dwelling not in bounds confind
But that with love intenser there thou viewst
Thy primal effluence hallowd be thy name
Join each created being to extol
Thy might for worthy humblest thanks and praise
Is thy blest Spirit May thy kingdoms peace
Come unto us for we unless it come
With all our striving thither tend in vain
As of their will the angels unto thee
Tender meet sacrifice circling thy throne
With loud hosannas so of theirs be done
By saintly men on earth Grant us this day
Our daily manna without which he roams
Through this rough desert retrograde who most
Toils to advance his steps As we to each
Pardon the evil done us pardon thou
Benign and of our merit take no count
Gainst the old adversary prove thou not
Our virtue easily subdud but free
From his incitements and defeat his wiles
This last petition dearest Lord is made
Not for ourselves since that were needless now
But for their sakes who after us remain

Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring
Those spirits went beneath a weight like that
We sometimes feel in dreams all sore beset
But with unequal anguish wearied all
Round the first circuit purging as they go
The worlds gross darkness off In our behalf
If there vows still be offerd what can here
For them be vowd and done by such whose wills
Have root of goodness in them Well beseems
That we should help them wash away the stains
They carried hence that so made pure and light
They may spring upward to the starry spheres

Ah so may mercytemperd justice rid
Your burdens speedily that ye have power
To stretch your wing which een to your desire
Shall lift you as ye show us on which hand
Toward the ladder leads the shortest way
And if there be more passages than one
Instruct us of that easiest to ascend
For this man who comes with me and bears yet
The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him
Despite his better will but slowly mounts
From whom the answer came unto these words
Which my guide spake appeard not but twas said

Along the bank to rightward come with us
And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil
Of living man to climb and were it not
That I am hinderd by the rock wherewith
This arrogant neck is tamd whence needs I stoop
My visage to the ground him who yet lives
Whose name thou speakst not him I fain would view
To mark if eer I knew himnd to crave
His pity for the fardel that I bear
I was of Latiun of a Tuscan horn
A mighty one Aldobranlescos name
My sires I know not if ye eer have heard
My old blood and forefathers gallant deeds
Made me so haughty that I clean forgot
The common mother and to such excess
Waxd in my scorn of all men that I fell
Fell therefore by what fate Siennas sons
Each child in Campagnatico can tell
I am Omberto not me only pride
Hath injurd but my kindred all involvd
In mischief with her Here my lot ordains
Under this weight to groan till I appease
Gods angry justice since I did it not
Amongst the living here amongst the dead

Listning I bent my visage down and one
Not he who spake twisted beneath the weight
That urgd him saw me knew me straight and calld
Holding his eyes With difficulty fixd
Intent upon me stooping as I went
Companion of their way O I exclaimd

Art thou not Oderigi art not thou
Agobbios glory glory of that art
Which they of Paris call the limmers skill

Brother said he with tints that gayer smile
Bolognian Francos pencil lines the leaves
His all the honour now mine borrowd light
In truth I had not been thus courteous to him
The whilst I livd through eagerness of zeal
For that preeminence my heart was bent on
Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid
Nor were I even here if able still
To sin I had not turnd me unto God
O powers of man how vain your glory nippd
Een in its height of verdure if an age
Less bright succeed not imbue thought
To lord it over paintings field and now
The cry is Giottos and his name eclipsd
Thus hath one Guido from the other snatchd
The letterd prize and he perhaps is born
Who shall drive either from their nest The noise
Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind
That blows from divers points and shifts its name
Shifting the point it blows from Shalt thou more
Live in the mouths of mankind if thy flesh
Part shriveld from thee than if thou hadst died
Before the coral and the pap were left
Or ere some thousand years have passed and that
Is to eternity compard a space
Briefer than is the twinkling of an eye
To the heavens slowest orb He there who treads
So leisurely before me far and wide
Through Tuscany resounded once and now
Is in Sienna scarce with whispers namd
There was he sovreign when destruction caught
The maddning rage of Florence in that day
Proud as she now is loathsome Your renown
Is as the herb whose hue doth come and go
And his might withers it by whom it sprang
Crude from the lap of earth I thus to him
True are thy sayings to my heart they breathe
The kindly spirit of meekness and allay
What tumours rankle there But who is he
Of whom thou spakst but nowThis he replied
Is Provenzano He is here because
He reachd with grasp presumptuous at the sway
Of all Sienna Thus he still hath gone
Thus goeth neverresting since he died
Such is th acquittance renderd back of him
Who beyond measure dard on earth I then
If soul that to the verge of life delays
Repentance linger in that lower space
Nor hither mount unless good prayers befriend
How chancd admittance was vouchsafd to him

When at his glorys topmost height said he
Respect of dignity all cast aside
Freely He fixd him on Siennas plain
A suitor to redeem his suffring friend
Who languishd in the prisonhouse of Charles
Nor for his sake refusd through every vein
To tremble More I will not say and dark
I know my words are but thy neighbours soon
Shall help thee to a comment on the text
This is the work that from these limits freed him




CANTO XII

With equal pace as oxen in the yoke
I with that laden spirit journeyd on
Long as the mild instructor sufferd me
But when he bade me quit him and proceed
For here said he behooves with sail and oars
Each man as best he may push on his bark
Upright as one disposd for speed I raisd
My body still in thought submissive bowd

I now my leaders track not loth pursued
And each had shown how light we fard along
When thus he warnd me Bend thine eyesight down
For thou to ease the way shall find it good
To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet

As in memorial of the buried drawn
Upon earthlevel tombs the sculpturd form
Of what was once appears at sight whereof
Tears often stream forth by remembrance wakd
Whose sacred stings the piteous only feel
So saw I there but with more curious skill
Of portraiture oerwrought whateer of space
From forth the mountain stretches On one part
Him I beheld above all creatures erst
Created noblest lightning fall from heaven
On th other side with bolt celestial piercd
Briareus cumbring earth he lay through dint
Of mortal icestroke The Thymbraean god
With Mars I saw and Pallas round their sire
Armd still and gazing on the giants limbs
Strewn oer th ethereal field Nimrod I saw
At foot of the stupendous work he stood
As if bewilderd looking on the crowd
Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaars plain

O Niobe in what a trance of woe
Thee I beheld upon that highway drawn
Sevn sons on either side thee slain Saul
How ghastly didst thou look on thine own sword
Expiring in Gilboa from that hour
Neer visited with rain from heavn or dew

O fond Arachne thee I also saw
Half spider now in anguish crawling up
Th unfinishd web thou weavedst to thy bane

O Rehoboam here thy shape doth seem
Louring no more defiance but fearsmote
With none to chase him in his chariot whirld

Was shown beside upon the solid floor
How dear Alcmaeon forcd his mother rate
That ornament in evil hour receivd
How in the temple on Sennacherib fell
His sons and how a corpse they left him there
Was shown the scath and cruel mangling made
By Tomyris on Cyrus when she cried
Blood thou didst thirst for take thy fill of blood
Was shown how routed in the battle fled
Th Assyrians Holofernes slain and een
The relics of the carnage Troy I markd
In ashes and in caverns Oh how falln
How abject Ilion was thy semblance there

What master of the pencil or the style
Had tracd the shades and lines that might have made
The subtlest workman wonder Dead the dead
The living seemd alive with clearer view
His eye beheld not who beheld the truth
Than mine what I did tread on while I went
Low bending Now swell out and with stiff necks
Pass on ye sons of Eve veil not your looks
Lest they descry the evil of your path

I noted not so busied was my thought
How much we now had circled of the mount
And of his course yet more the sun had spent
When he who with still wakeful caution went
Admonishd Raise thou up thy head for know
Time is not now for slow suspense Behold
That way an angel hasting towards us Lo
Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return
From service on the day Wear thou in look
And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe
That gladly he may forward us aloft
Consider that this day neer dawns again

Times loss he had so often warnd me gainst
I could not miss the scope at which he aimd

The goodly shape approachd us snowy white
In vesture and with visage casting streams
Of tremulous lustre like the matin star
His arms he opend then his wings and spake
Onward the steps behold are near and now
Th ascent is without difficulty gaind

A scanty few are they who when they hear
Such tidings hasten O ye race of men
Though born to soar why suffer ye a wind
So slight to baffle ye He led us on
Where the rock parted here against my front
Did beat his wings then promisd I should fare
In safety on my way As to ascend
That steep upon whose brow the chapel stands
Oer Rubaconte looking lordly down
On the wellguided city up the right
Th impetuous rise is broken by the steps
Carvd in that old and simple age when still
The registry and label rested safe
Thus is th acclivity relievd which here
Precipitous from the other circuit falls
But on each hand the tall cliff presses close

As entring there we turnd voices in strain
Ineffable sang Blessed are the poor
In spirit Ah how far unlike to these
The straits of hell here songs to usher us
There shrieks of woe We climb the holy stairs
And lighter to myself by far I seemd
Than on the plain before whence thus I spake
Say master of what heavy thing have I
Been lightend that scarce aught the sense of toil
Affects me journeying He in few replied
When sins broad characters that yet remain
Upon thy temples though well nigh effacd
Shall be as one is all clean razed out
Then shall thy feet by heartiness of will
Be so oercome they not alone shall feel
No sense of labour but delight much more
Shall wait them urgd along their upward way

Then like to one upon whose head is placd
Somewhat he deems not of but from the becks
Of others as they pass him by his hand
Lends therefore help to assure him searches finds
And well performs such office as the eye
Wants power to execute so stretching forth
The fingers of my right hand did I find
Six only of the letters which his sword
Who bare the keys had tracd upon my brow
The leader as he markd mine action smild




CANTO XIII

We reachd the summit of the scale and stood
Upon the second buttress of that mount
Which healeth him who climbs A cornice there
Like to the former girdles round the hill
Save that its arch with sweep less ample bends

Shadow nor image there is seen all smooth
The rampart and the path reflecting nought
But the rocks sullen hue If here we wait
For some to question said the bard I fear
Our choice may haply meet too long delay

Then fixedly upon the sun his eyes
He fastnd made his right the central point
From whence to move and turnd the left aside
O pleasant light my confidence and hope
Conduct us thou he cried on this new way
Where now I venture leading to the bourn
We seek The universal world to thee
Owes warmth and lustre If no other cause
Forbid thy beams should ever be our guide

Far as is measurd for a mile on earth
In brief space had we journeyd such prompt will
Impelld and towards us flying now were heard
Spirits invisible who courteously
Unto loves table bade the welcome guest
The voice that firstlew by calld forth aloud
They have no wine so on behind us past
Those sounds reiterating nor yet lost
In the faint distance when another came
Crying I am Orestes and alike
Wingd its fleet way Oh father I exclaimd
What tongues are these and as I questiond lo
A third exclaiming Love ye those have wrongd you

This circuit said my teacher knots the scourge
For envy and the cords are therefore drawn
By charitys correcting hand The curb
Is of a harsher sound as thou shalt hear
If I deem rightly ere thou reach the pass
Where pardon sets them free But fix thine eyes
Intently through the air and thou shalt see
A multitude before thee seated each
Along the shelving grot Then more than erst
I opd my eyes before me viewd and saw
Shadows with garments dark as was the rock
And when we passd a little forth I heard
A crying Blessed Mary pray for us
Michael and Peter all ye saintly host

I do not think there walks on earth this day
Man so remorseless that he hath not yearnd
With pity at the sight that next I saw
Mine eyes a load of sorrow teemed when now
I stood so near them that their semblances
Came clearly to my view Of sackcloth vile
Their covring seemd and on his shoulder one
Did stay another leaning and all leand
Against the cliff Een thus the blind and poor
Near the confessionals to crave an alms
Stand each his head upon his fellows sunk

So most to stir compassion not by sound
Of words alone but that which moves not less
The sight of misry And as never beam
Of noonday visiteth the eyeless man
Een so was heavn a niggard unto these
Of his fair light for through the orbs of all
A thread of wire impiercing knits them up
As for the taming of a haggard hawk

It were a wrong methought to pass and look
On others yet myself the while unseen
To my sage counsel therefore did I turn
He knew the meaning of the mute appeal
Nor waited for my questioning but said
Speak and be brief be subtle in thy words

On that part of the cornice whence no rim
Engarlands its steep fall did Virgil come
On the other side me were the spirits their cheeks
Bathing devout with penitential tears
That through the dread impalement forcd a way

I turnd me to them and O shades said I

Assurd that to your eyes unveild shall shine
The lofty light sole object of your wish
So may heavens grace clear whatsoeer of foam
Floats turbid on the conscience that thenceforth
The stream of mind roll limpid from its source
As ye declare for so shall ye impart
A boon I dearly prize if any soul
Of Latium dwell among ye and perchance
That soul may profit if I learn so much

My brother we are each one citizens
Of one true city Any thou wouldst say
Who lived a stranger in Italias land

So heard I answering as appeald a voice
That onward came some space from whence I stood

A spirit I noted in whose look was markd
Expectance Ask ye how The chin was raisd
As in one reft of sight Spirit said I
Who for thy rise are tutoring if thou be
That which didst answer to me or by place
Or name disclose thyself that I may know thee

I was it answerd of Sienna here
I cleanse away with these the evil life
Soliciting with tears that He who is
Vouchsafe him to us Though Sapia namd
In sapience I excelld not gladder far
Of others hurt than of the good befell me
That thou mayst own I now deceive thee not
Hear if my folly were not as I speak it
When now my years slopd waning down the arch
It so bechancd my fellow citizens
Near Colle met their enemies in the field
And I prayd God to grant what He had willd
There were they vanquishd and betook themselves
Unto the bitter passages of flight
I markd the hunt and waxing out of bounds
In gladness lifted up my shameless brow
And like the merlin cheated by a gleam
Cried It is over Heavn fear thee not
Upon my verge of life I wishd for peace
With God nor repentance had supplied
What I did lack of duty were it not
The hermit Piero touchd with charity
In his devout orisons thought on me
But who art thou that questionst of our state
Who gost to my belief with lids unclosd
And breathest in thy talkMine eyes said I
May yet be here taen from me but not long
For they have not offended grievously
With envious glances But the woe beneath
Urges my soul with more exceeding dread
That nether load already weighs me down

She thus Who then amongst us here aloft
Hath brought thee if thou weenest to return

He answerd I who standeth mute beside me
I live of me ask therefore chosen spirit
If thou desire I yonder yet should move
For thee my mortal feetOh she replied
This is so strange a thing it is great sign
That God doth love thee Therefore with thy prayer
Sometime assist me and by that I crave
Which most thou covetest that if thy feet
Eer tread on Tuscan soil thou save my fame
Amongst my kindred Them shalt thou behold
With that vain multitude who set their hope
On Telamones haven there to fail
Confounded more shall when the fancied stream
They sought of Dian calld but they who lead
Their navies more than ruind hopes shall mourn




CANTO XIV

Say who is he around our mountain winds
Or ever death has prund his wing for flight
That opes his eyes and covers them at will

I know not who he is but know thus much
He comes not singly Do thou ask of him
For thou art nearer to him and take heed
Accost him gently so that he may speak

Thus on the right two Spirits bending each
Toward the other talkd of me then both
Addressing me their faces backward leand
And thus the one began O soul who yet
Pent in the body tendest towards the sky
For charity we pray thee comfort us
Recounting whence thou comst and who thou art
For thou dost make us at the favour shown thee
Marvel as at a thing that neer hath been

There stretches through the midst of Tuscany
I straight began a brooklet whose wellhead
Springs up in Falterona with his race
Not satisfied when he some hundred miles
Hath measurd From his banks bring I this frame
To tell you who I am were words misspent
For yet my name scarce sounds on rumours lip

If well I do incorprate with my thought
The meaning of thy speech said he who first
Addrest me thou dost speak of Arnos wave

To whom the other Why hath he conceald
The title of that river as a man
Doth of some horrible thing The spirit who
Thereof was questiond did acquit him thus
I know not but tis fitting well the name
Should perish of that vale for from the source
Where teems so plenteously the Alpine steep
Maimd of Pelorus that doth scarcely pass
Beyond that limit even to the point
Whereunto ocean is restord what heaven
Drains from th exhaustless store for all earths streams
Throughout the space is virtue worried down
As twere a snake by all for mortal foe
Or through disastrous influence on the place
Or else distortion of misguided wills
That custom goads to evil whence in those
The dwellers in that miserable vale
Nature is so transformd it seems as they
Had shard of Circes feeding Midst brute swine
Worthier of acorns than of other food
Created for mans use he shapeth first
His obscure way then sloping onward finds
Curs snarlers more in spite than power from whom
He turns with scorn aside still journeying down
By how much more the curst and luckless foss
Swells out to largeness een so much it finds
Dogs turning into wolves Descending still
Through yet more hollow eddies next he meets
A race of foxes so replete with craft
They do not fear that skill can master it
Nor will I cease because my words are heard
By other ears than thine It shall be well
For this man if he keep in memory
What from no erring Spirit I reveal
Lo behold thy grandson that becomes
A hunter of those wolves upon the shore
Of the fierce stream and cows them all with dread
Their flesh yet living sets he up to sale
Then like an aged beast to slaughter dooms
Many of life he reaves himself of worth
And goodly estimation Smeard with gore
Mark how he issues from the rueful wood
Leaving such havoc that in thousand years
It spreads not to prime lustihood again

As one who tidings hears of woe to come
Changes his looks perturbd from whateer part
The peril grasp him so beheld I change
That spirit who had turnd to listen struck
With sadness soon as he had caught the word

His visage and the others speech did raise
Desire in me to know the names of both
whereof with meek entreaty I inquird

The shade who late addrest me thus resumd
Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do
For thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine
But since Gods will is that so largely shine
His grace in thee I will be liberal too
Guido of Duca know then that I am
Envy so parchd my blood that had I seen
A fellow man made joyous thou hadst markd
A livid paleness overspread my cheek
Such harvest reap I of the seed I sowd
O man why place thy heart where there doth need
Exclusion of participants in good
This is Rinieris spirit this the boast
And honour of the house of Calboli
Where of his worth no heritage remains
Nor his the only blood that hath been stript
twixt Po the mount the Reno and the shore
Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss
But in those limits such a growth has sprung
Of rank and venomd roots as long would mock
Slow cultures toil Where is good Liziohere
Manardi Traversalo and Carpigna
O bastard slips of old Romagnas line
When in Bologna the low artisan
And in Faenza yon Bernardin sprouts
A gentle cyon from ignoble stem
Wonder not Tuscan if thou see me weep
When I recall to mind those once lovd names
Guido of Prata and of Azzo him
That dwelt with you Tignoso and his troop
With Traversaros house and Anastagios
Each race disherited and beside these
The ladies and the knights the toils and ease
That witchd us into love and courtesy
Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts
O Brettinoro wherefore tarriest still
Since forth of thee thy family hath gone
And many hating evil joind their steps
Well doeth he that bids his lineage cease
Bagnacavallo Castracaro ill
And Conio worse who care to propagate
A race of Counties from such blood as theirs
Well shall ye also do Pagani then
When from amongst you tries your demon child
Not so howeer that henceforth there remain
True proof of what ye were O Hugolin
Thou sprung of Fantolinis line thy name
Is safe since none is lookd for after thee
To cloud its lustre warping from thy stock
But Tuscan go thy ways for now I take
Far more delight in weeping than in words
Such pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart

We knew those gentle spirits at parting heard
Our steps Their silence therefore of our way
Assurd us Soon as we had quitted them
Advancing onward lo a voice that seemd
Like vollied lightning when it rives the air
Met us and shouted Whosoever finds
Will slay me then fled from us as the bolt
Lancd sudden from a downwardrushing cloud
When it had givn short truce unto our hearing
Behold the other with a crash as loud
As the quickfollowing thunder Mark in me
Aglauros turnd to rock I at the sound
Retreating drew more closely to my guide

Now in mute stillness rested all the air
And thus he spake There was the galling bit
But your old enemy so baits his hook
He drags you eager to him Hence nor curb
Avails you nor reclaiming call Heavn calls
And round about you wheeling courts your gaze
With everlasting beauties Yet your eye
Turns with fond doting still upon the earth
Therefore He smites you who discerneth all




CANTO XV

As much as twixt the third hours close and dawn
Appeareth of heavns sphere that ever whirls
As restless as an infant in his play
So much appeard remaining to the sun
Of his slope journey towards the western goal

Evening was there and here the noon of night
and full upon our forehead smote the beams
For round the mountain circling so our path
Had led us that toward the sunset now
Direct we journeyd when I felt a weight
Of more exceeding splendour than before
Press on my front The cause unknown amaze
Possessd me and both hands against my brow
Lifting I interposd them as a screen
That of its gorgeous superflux of light
Clippd the diminishd orb As when the ray
Striking On water or the surface clear
Of mirror leaps unto the opposite part
Ascending at a glance een as it fell
And so much differs from the stone that falls
Through equal space as practice skill hath shown
Thus with refracted light before me seemed
The ground there smitten whence in sudden haste
My sight recoild What is this sire belovd
Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain
Cried I and which towards us moving seems

Marvel not if the family of heavn
He answerd yet with dazzling radiance dim
Thy sense it is a messenger who comes
Inviting mans ascent Such sights ere long
Not grievous shall impart to thee delight
As thy perception is by nature wrought
Up to their pitch The blessed angel soon
As we had reachd him haild us with glad voice
Here enter on a ladder far less steep
Than ye have yet encounterd We forthwith
Ascending heard behind us chanted sweet
Blessed the merciful and happy thou
That conquerst Lonely each my guide and I
Pursued our upward way and as we went
Some profit from his words I hopd to win
And thus of him inquiring framd my speech

What meant Romagnas spirit when he spake
Of bliss exclusive with no partner shard

He straight replied No wonder since he knows
What sorrow waits on his own worst defect
If he chide others that they less may mourn
Because ye point your wishes at a mark
Where by communion of possessors part
Is lessend envy bloweth up the sighs of men
No fear of that might touch ye if the love
Of higher sphere exalted your desire
For there by how much more they call it ours
So much propriety of each in good
Increases more and heightend charity
Wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame

Now lack I satisfaction more said I
Than if thou hadst been silent at the first
And doubt more gathers on my labring thought
How can it chance that good distributed
The many that possess it makes more rich
Than if t were shard by few He answering thus
Thy mind reverting still to things of earth
Strikes darkness from true light The highest good
Unlimited ineffable doth so speed
To love as beam to lucid body darts
Giving as much of ardour as it finds
The sempiternal effluence streams abroad
Spreading wherever charity extends
So that the more aspirants to that bliss
Are multiplied more good is there to love
And more is lovd as mirrors that reflect
Each unto other propagated light
If these my words avail not to allay
Thy thirsting Beatrice thou shalt see
Who of this want and of all else thou hast
Shall rid thee to the full Provide but thou
That from thy temples may be soon erasd
Een as the two already those five scars
That when they pain thee worst then kindliest heal

Thou I had said contentst me when I saw
The other round was gaind and wondring eyes
Did keep me mute There suddenly I seemd
By an ecstatic vision wrapt away
And in a temple saw methought a crowd
Of many persons and at th entrance stood
A dame whose sweet demeanour did express
A mothers love who said Child why hast thou
Dealt with us thus Behold thy sire and I
Sorrowing have sought thee and so held her peace
And straight the vision fled A female next
Appeard before me down whose visage coursd
Those waters that grief forces out from one
By deep resentment stung who seemd to say
If thou Pisistratus be lord indeed
Over this city namd with such debate
Of adverse gods and whence each science sparkles
Avenge thee of those arms whose bold embrace
Hath claspd our daughter and to fuel meseemd
Benign and meek with visage undisturbd
Her sovran spake How shall we those requite
Who wish us evil if we thus condemn
The man that loves us After that I saw
A multitude in fury burning slay
With stones a stripling youth and shout amain
Destroy destroy and him I saw who bowd
Heavy with death unto the ground yet made
His eyes unfolded upward gates to heavn

Praying forgiveness of th Almighty Sire
Amidst that cruel conflict on his foes
With looks that With compassion to their aim

Soon as my spirit from her airy flight
Returning sought again the things whose truth
Depends not on her shaping I observd
How she had rovd to no unreal scenes

Meanwhile the leader who might see I movd
As one who struggles to shake off his sleep
Exclaimd What ails thee that thou canst not hold
Thy footing firm but more than half a league
Hast traveld with closd eyes and tottring gait
Like to a man by wine or sleep oerchargd

Beloved father so thou deign said I
To listen I will tell thee what appeard
Before me when so faild my sinking steps

He thus Not if thy Countenance were maskd
With hundred vizards could a thought of thine
How small soeer elude me What thou sawst
Was shown that freely thou mightst ope thy heart
To the waters of peace that flow diffusd
From their eternal fountain I not askd
What ails theeor such cause as he doth who
Looks only with that eye which sees no more
When spiritless the body lies but askd
To give fresh vigour to thy foot Such goads
The slow and loitring need that they be found
Not wanting when their hour of watch returns

So on we journeyd through the evening sky
Gazing intent far onward as our eyes
With level view could stretch against the bright
Vespertine ray and lo by slow degrees
Gathring a fog made towrds us dark as night
There was no room for scaping and that mist
Bereft us both of sight and the pure air




CANTO XVI

Hells dunnest gloom or night unlustrous dark
Of every planes reft and palld in clouds
Did never spread before the sight a veil
In thickness like that fog nor to the sense
So palpable and gross Entring its shade
Mine eye endured not with unclosed lids
Which marking near me drew the faithful guide
Offering me his shoulder for a stay

As the blind man behind his leader walks
Lest he should err or stumble unawares
On what might harm him or perhaps destroy
I journeyd through that bitter air and foul
Still listning to my escorts warning voice
Look that from me thou part not Straight I heard
Voices and each one seemd to pray for peace
And for compassion to the Lamb of God
That taketh sins away Their prelude still
Was Agnus Dei and through all the choir
One voice one measure ran that perfect seemd
The concord of their song Are these I hear
Spirits O master I exclaimd and he
Thou aimst aright these loose the bonds of wrath

Now who art thou that through our smoke dost cleave
And speakst of us as thou thyself een yet
Dividest time by calends So one voice
Bespake me whence my master said Reply
And ask if upward hence the passage lead

O being who dost make thee pure to stand
Beautiful once more in thy Makers sight
Along with me and thou shalt hear and wonder
Thus I whereto the spirit answering spake

Long as t is lawful for me shall my steps
Follow on thine and since the cloudy smoke
Forbids the seeing hearing in its stead
Shall keep us joind I then forthwith began
Yet in my mortal swathing I ascend
To higher regions and am hither come
Through the fearful agony of hell
And if so largely God hath doled his grace
That clean beside all modern precedent
He wills me to behold his kingly state
From me conceal not who thou wast ere death
Had loosd thee but instruct me and instruct
If rightly to the pass I tend thy words
The way directing as a safe escort

I was of Lombardy and Marco calld
Not inexperiencd of the world that worth
I still affected from which all have turnd
The nerveless bow aside Thy course tends right
Unto the summit and replying thus
He added I beseech thee pray for me
When thou shalt come aloft And I to him
Accept my faith for pledge I will perform
What thou requirest Yet one doubt remains
That wrings me sorely if I solve it not
Singly before it urgd me doubled now
By thine opinion when I couple that
With one elsewhere declard each strengthning other
The world indeed is even so forlorn
Of all good as thou speakst it and so swarms
With every evil Yet beseech thee point
The cause out to me that myself may see
And unto others show it for in heaven
One places it and one on earth below

Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh
Brother he thus began the world is blind
And thou in truth comst from it Ye who live
Do so each cause refer to heavn above
Een as its motion of necessity
Drew with it all that moves If this were so
Free choice in you were none nor justice would
There should be joy for virtue woe for ill
Your movements have their primal bent from heaven
Not all yet said I all what then ensues
Light have ye still to follow evil or good
And of the will free power which if it stand
Firm and unwearied in Heavns first assay
Conquers at last so it be cherishd well
Triumphant over all To mightier force
To better nature subject ye abide
Free not constraind by that which forms in you
The reasoning mind uninfluencd of the stars
If then the present race of mankind err
Seek in yourselves the cause and find it there
Herein thou shalt confess me no false spy

Forth from his plastic hand who charmd beholds
Her image ere she yet exist the soul
Comes like a babe that wantons sportively
Weeping and laughing in its wayward moods
As artless and as ignorant of aught
Save that her Maker being one who dwells
With gladness ever willingly she turns
To whateer yields her joy Of some slight good
The flavour soon she tastes and snard by that
With fondness she pursues it if no guide
Recall no rein direct her wandring course
Hence it behovd the law should be a curb
A sovereign hence behovd whose piercing view
Might mark at least the fortress and main tower
Of the true city Laws indeed there are
But who is he observes them None not he
Who goes before the shepherd of the flock
Who chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof
Therefore the multitude who see their guide
Strike at the very good they covet most
Feed there and look no further Thus the cause
Is not corrupted nature in yourselves
But illconducting that hath turnd the world
To evil Rome that turnd it unto good
Was wont to boast two suns whose several beams
Cast light on either way the worlds and Gods
One since hath quenchd the other and the sword
Is grafted on the crook and so conjoind
Each must perforce decline to worse unawd
By fear of other If thou doubt me mark
The blade each herb is judgd of by its seed
That land through which Adice and the Po
Their waters roll was once the residence
Of courtesy and velour ere the day
That frownd on Frederick now secure may pass
Those limits whosoeer hath left for shame
To talk with good men or come near their haunts
Three aged ones are still found there in whom
The old time chides the new these deem it long
Ere God restore them to a better world
The good Gherardo of Palazzo he
Conrad and Guido of Castello namd
In Gallic phrase more fitly the plain Lombard
On this at last conclude The church of Rome
Mixing two governments that ill assort
Hath missd her footing falln into the mire
And there herself and burden much defild

O Marco I replied shine arguments
Convince me and the cause I now discern
Why of the heritage no portion came
To Levis offspring But resolve me this
Who that Gherardo is that as thou sayst
Is left a sample of the perishd race
And for rebuke to this untoward age

Either thy words said he deceive or else
Are meant to try me that thou speaking Tuscan
Appearst not to have heard of good Gherado
The sole addition that by which I know him
Unless I borrowd from his daughter Gaia
Another name to grace him God be with you
I bear you company no more Behold
The dawn with white ray glimmring through the mist
I must awaythe angel comesere he
Appear He said and would not hear me more




CANTO XVII

Call to remembrance reader if thou eer
Hast on a mountain top been taen by cloud
Through which thou sawst no better than the mole
Doth through opacous membrane then wheneer
The watry vapours dense began to melt
Into thin air how faintly the suns sphere
Seemd wading through them so thy nimble thought
May image how at first I rebeheld
The sun that bedward now his couch oerhung

Thus with my leaders feet still equaling pace
From forth that cloud I came when now expird
The parting beams from off the nether shores

O quick and forgetive power that sometimes dost
So rob us of ourselves we take no mark
Though round about us thousand trumpets clang
What moves thee if the senses stir not Light
Kindled in heavn spontaneous selfinformd
Or likelier gliding down with swift illapse
By will divine Portrayd before me came
The traces of her dire impiety
Whose form was changd into the bird that most
Delights itself in song and here my mind
Was inwardly so wrapt it gave no place
To aught that askd admittance from without

Next showerd into my fantasy a shape
As of one crucified whose visage spake
Fell rancour malice deep wherein he died
And round him Ahasuerus the great king
Esther his bride and Mordecai the just
Blameless in word and deed As of itself
That unsubstantial coinage of the brain
Burst like a bubble Which the water fails
That fed it in my vision straight uprose
A damsel weeping loud and cried O queen
O mother wherefore has intemperate ire
Drivn thee to loath thy being Not to lose
Lavinia desprate thou hast slain thyself
Now hast thou lost me I am she whose tears
Mourn ere I fall a mothers timeless end

Een as a sleep breaks off if suddenly
New radiance strike upon the closed lids
The broken slumber quivering ere it dies
Thus from before me sunk that imagery
Vanishing soon as on my face there struck
The light outshining far our earthly beam
As round I turnd me to survey what place
I had arrivd at Here ye mount exclaimd
A voice that other purpose left me none
Save will so eager to behold who spake
I could not choose but gaze As fore the sun
That weighs our vision down and veils his form
In light transcendent thus my virtue faild
Unequal This is Spirit from above
Who marshals us our upward way unsought
And in his own light shrouds him As a man
Doth for himself so now is done for us
For whoso waits imploring yet sees need
Of his prompt aidance sets himself prepard
For blunt denial ere the suit be made
Refuse we not to lend a ready foot
At such inviting haste we to ascend
Before it darken for we may not then
Till morn again return So spake my guide
And to one ladder both addressd our steps
And the first stair approaching I perceivd
Near me as twere the waving of a wing
That fannd my face and whisperd Blessed they
The peacemakers they know not evil wrath

Now to such height above our heads were raisd
The last beams followd close by hooded night
That many a star on all sides through the gloom
Shone out Why partest from me O my strength
So with myself I commund for I felt
My oertoild sinews slacken We had reachd
The summit and were fixd like to a bark
Arrivd at land And waiting a short space
If aught should meet mine ear in that new round
Then to my guide I turnd and said Lovd sire
Declare what guilt is on this circle purgd
If our feet rest no need thy speech should pause

He thus to me The love of good whateer
Wanted of just proportion here fulfils
Here plies afresh the oar that loiterd ill
But that thou mayst yet clearlier understand
Give ear unto my words and thou shalt cull
Some fruit may please thee well from this delay

Creator nor created being neer
My son he thus began was without love
Or natural or the free spirits growth
Thou hast not that to learn The natural still
Is without error but the other swerves
If on ill object bent or through excess
Of vigour or defect While eer it seeks
The primal blessings or with measure due
Th inferior no delight that flows from it
Partakes of ill But let it warp to evil
Or with more ardour than behooves or less
Pursue the good the thing created then
Works gainst its Maker Hence thou must infer
That love is germin of each virtue in ye
And of each act no less that merits pain
Now since it may not be but love intend
The welfare mainly of the thing it loves
All from selfhatred are secure and since
No being can be thought t exist apart
And independent of the first a bar
Of equal force restrains from hating that

Grant the distinction just and it remains
The evil must be anothers which is lovd
Three ways such love is genderd in your clay
There is who hopes his neighbours worth deprest
Preeminence himself and coverts hence
For his own greatness that another fall
There is who so much fears the loss of power
Fame favour glory should his fellow mount
Above him and so sickens at the thought
He loves their opposite and there is he
Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame
That he doth thirst for vengeance and such needs
Must doat on others evil Here beneath
This threefold love is mournd Of th other sort
Be now instructed that which follows good
But with disorderd and irregular course

All indistinctly apprehend a bliss
On which the soul may rest the hearts of all
Yearn after it and to that wished bourn
All therefore strive to tend If ye behold
Or seek it with a love remiss and lax
This cornice after just repenting lays
Its penal torment on ye Other good
There is where man finds not his happiness
It is not true fruition not that blest
Essence of every good the branch and root
The love too lavishly bestowd on this
Along three circles over us is mournd
Account of that division tripartite
Expect not fitter for thine own research




CANTO XVIII

The teacher ended and his high discourse
Concluding earnest in my looks inquird
If I appeard content and I whom still
Unsated thirst to hear him urgd was mute
Mute outwardly yet inwardly I said
Perchance my too much questioning offends
But he true father markd the secret wish
By diffidence restraind and speaking gave
Me boldness thus to speak Master my Sight
Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams
That all thy words convey distinct is seen
Wherefore I pray thee father whom this heart
Holds dearest thou wouldst deign by proof t unfold
That love from which as from their source thou bringst
All good deeds and their opposite He then
To what I now disclose be thy clear ken
Directed and thou plainly shalt behold
How much those blind have errd who make themselves
The guides of men The soul created apt
To love moves versatile which way soeer
Aught pleasing prompts her soon as she is wakd
By pleasure into act Of substance true
Your apprehension forms its counterfeit
And in you the ideal shape presenting
Attracts the souls regard If she thus drawn
incline toward it love is that inclining
And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye
Then as the fire points up and mounting seeks
His birthplace and his lasting seat een thus
Enters the captive soul into desire
Which is a spiritual motion that neer rests
Before enjoyment of the thing it loves
Enough to show thee how the truth from those
Is hidden who aver all love a thing
Praiseworthy in itself although perhaps
Its substance seem still good Yet if the wax
Be good it follows not th impression must
What love is I returnd thy words O guide
And my own docile mind reveal Yet thence
New doubts have sprung For from without if love
Be offerd to us and the spirit knows
No other footing tend she right or wrong
Is no desert of hers He answering thus
What reason here discovers I have power
To show thee that which lies beyond expect
From Beatrice faith not reasons task
Spirit substantial form with matter joind
Not in confusion mixd hath in itself
Specific virtue of that union born
Which is not felt except it work nor provd
But through effect as vegetable life
By the green leaf From whence his intellect
Deduced its primal notices of things
Man therefore knows not or his appetites
Their first affections such in you as zeal
In bees to gather honey at the first
Volition meriting nor blame nor praise
But oer each lower faculty supreme
That as she list are summond to her bar
Ye have that virtue in you whose just voice
Uttereth counsel and whose word should keep
The threshold of assent Here is the source
Whence cause of merit in you is derivd
Een as the affections good or ill she takes
Or severs winnowd as the chaff Those men
Who reasning went to depth profoundest markd
That innate freedom and were thence inducd
To leave their moral teaching to the world
Grant then that from necessity arise
All love that glows within you to dismiss
Or harbour it the powr is in yourselves
Remember Beatrice in her style
Denominates free choice by eminence
The noble virtue if in talk with thee
She touch upon that theme The moon well nigh
To midnight hour belated made the stars
Appear to wink and fade and her broad disk
Seemd like a crag on fire as up the vault
That course she journeyd which the sun then warms
When they of Rome behold him at his set
Betwixt Sardinia and the Corsic isle
And now the weight that hung upon my thought
Was lightend by the aid of that clear spirit
Who raiseth Andes above Mantuas name
I therefore when my questions had obtaind
Solution plain and ample stood as one
Musing in dreary slumber but not long
Slumberd for suddenly a multitude

The steep already turning from behind
Rushd on With fury and like random rout
As echoing on their shores at midnight heard
Ismenus and Asopus for his Thebes
If Bacchus help were needed so came these
Tumultuous curving each his rapid step
By eagerness impelld of holy love

Soon they oertook us with such swiftness movd
The mighty crowd Two spirits at their head
Cried weeping Blessed Mary sought with haste
The hilly region Caesar to subdue
Ilerda darted in Marseilles his sting
And flew to SpainOh tarry not away
The others shouted let not time be lost
Through slackness of affection Hearty zeal
To serve reanimates celestial grace

O ye in whom intenser fervency
Haply supplies where lukewarm erst ye faild
Slow or neglectful to absolve your part
Of good and virtuous this man who yet lives
Credit my tale though strange desires t ascend
So morning rise to light us Therefore say
Which hand leads nearest to the rifted rock

So spake my guide to whom a shade returnd
Come after us and thou shalt find the cleft
We may not linger such resistless will
Speeds our unwearied course Vouchsafe us then
Thy pardon if our duty seem to thee
Discourteous rudeness In Verona I
Was abbot of San Zeno when the hand
Of Barbarossa graspd Imperial sway
That name neer utterd without tears in Milan
And there is he hath one foot in his grave
Who for that monastery ere long shall weep
Ruing his power misusd for that his son
Of body ill compact and worse in mind
And born in evil he hath set in place
Of its true pastor Whether more he spake
Or here was mute I know not he had sped
Een now so far beyond us Yet thus much
I heard and in remembrance treasurd it

He then who never faild me at my need
Cried Hither turn Lo two with sharp remorse
Chiding their sin In rear of all the troop
These shouted First they died to whom the sea
Opend or ever Jordan saw his heirs
And they who with Aeneas to the end
Endurd not suffering for their portion chose
Life without glory Soon as they had fled
Past reach of sight new thought within me rose
By others followd fast and each unlike
Its fellow till led on from thought to thought
And pleasurd with the fleeting train mine eye
Was closd and meditation changd to dream




CANTO XIX

It was the hour when of diurnal heat
No reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon
Oerpowerd by earth or planetary sway
Of Saturn and the geomancer sees
His Greater Fortune up the east ascend
Where gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone
When fore me in my dream a womans shape
There came with lips that stammerd eyes aslant
Distorted feet hands maimd and colour pale

I lookd upon her and as sunshine cheers
Limbs numbd by nightly cold een thus my look
Unloosd her tongue next in brief space her form
Decrepit raisd erect and faded face
With loves own hue illumd Recovring speech
She forthwith warbling such a strain began
That I how loth soeer could scarce have held
Attention from the song I thus she sang
I am the Siren she whom mariners
On the wide sea are wilderd when they hear
Such fulness of delight the listner feels
I from his course Ulysses by my lay
Enchanted drew Whoeer frequents me once
Parts seldom so I charm him and his heart
Contented knows no void Or ere her mouth
Was closd to shame her at her side appeard
A dame of semblance holy With stern voice
She utterd Say O Virgil who is this
Which hearing he approachd with eyes still bent
Toward that goodly presence th other seizd her
And her robes tearing opend her before
And showd the belly to me whence a smell
Exhaling loathsome wakd me Round I turnd
Mine eyes and thus the teacher At the least
Three times my voice hath calld thee Rise begone
Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass

I straightway rose Now day pourd down from high
Filld all the circuits of the sacred mount
And as we journeyd on our shoulder smote
The early ray I followd stooping low
My forehead as a man oerchargd with thought
Who bends him to the likeness of an arch
That midway spans the flood when thus I heard
Come enter here in tone so soft and mild
As never met the ear on mortal strand

With swanlike wings dispread and pointing up
Who thus had spoken marshald us along
Where each side of the solid masonry
The sloping walls retird then movd his plumes
And fanning us affirmd that those who mourn
Are blessed for that comfort shall be theirs

What aileth thee that still thou lookst to earth
Began my leader while th angelic shape
A little over us his station took

New vision I replied hath raisd in me
Surmisings strange and anxious doubts whereon
My soul intent allows no other thought
Or room or entranceHast thou seen said he
That old enchantress her whose wiles alone
The spirits oer us weep for Hast thou seen
How man may free him of her bonds Enough
Let thy heels spurn the earth and thy raisd ken
Fix on the lure which heavns eternal King
Whirls in the rolling spheres As on his feet
The falcon first looks down then to the sky
Turns and forth stretches eager for the food
That woos him thither so the call I heard
So onward far as the dividing rock
Gave way I journeyd till the plain was reachd

On the fifth circle when I stood at large
A race appeard before me on the ground
All downward lying prone and weeping sore
My soul hath cleaved to the dust I heard
With sighs so deep they well nigh choakd the words
O ye elect of God whose penal woes
Both hope and justice mitigate direct
Towrds the steep rising our uncertain way

If ye approach secure from this our doom
Prostrationand would urge your course with speed
See that ye still to rightward keep the brink

So them the bard besought and such the words
Beyond us some short space in answer came

I noted what remaind yet hidden from them
Thence to my lieges eyes mine eyes I bent
And he forthwith interpreting their suit
Beckond his glad assent Free then to act
As pleasd me I drew near and took my stand
Oer that shade whose words I late had markd
And Spirit I said in whom repentant tears
Mature that blessed hour when thou with God
Shalt find acceptance for a while suspend
For me that mightier care Say who thou wast
Why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone
And if in aught ye wish my service there
Whence living I am come He answering spake
The cause why Heavn our back toward his cope
Reverses shalt thou know but me know first
The successor of Peter and the name
And title of my lineage from that stream
That twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws
His limpid waters through the lowly glen
A month and little more by proof I learnt
With what a weight that robe of sovreignty
Upon his shoulder rests who from the mire
Would guard it that each other fardel seems
But feathers in the balance Late alas
Was my conversion but when I became
Romes pastor I discernd at once the dream
And cozenage of life saw that the heart
Rested not there and yet no prouder height
Lurd on the climber wherefore of that life
No more enamourd in my bosom love
Of purer being kindled For till then
I was a soul in misery alienate
From God and covetous of all earthly things
Now as thou seest here punishd for my doting
Such cleansing from the taint of avarice
Do spirits converted need This mount inflicts
No direr penalty Een as our eyes
Fastend below nor eer to loftier clime
Were lifted thus hath justice leveld us
Here on the earth As avarice quenchd our love
Of good without which is no working thus
Here justice holds us prisond hand and foot
Chaind down and bound while heavens just Lord shall please
So long to tarry motionless outstretchd

My knees I stoopd and would have spoke but he
Ere my beginning by his ear perceivd
I did him reverence and What cause said he
Hath bowd thee thusCompunction I rejoind
And inward awe of your high dignity

Up he exclaimd brother upon thy feet
Arise err not thy fellow servant I
Thine and all others of one Sovran Power
If thou hast ever markd those holy sounds
Of gospel truth nor shall be given ill marriage
Thou mayst discern the reasons of my speech
Go thy ways now and linger here no more
Thy tarrying is a let unto the tears
With which I hasten that whereof thou spakst
I have on earth a kinswoman her name
Alagia worthy in herself so ill
Example of our house corrupt her not
And she is all remaineth of me there




CANTO XX

Ill strives the will gainst will more wise that strives
His pleasure therefore to mine own preferrd
I drew the sponge yet thirsty from the wave

Onward I movd he also onward movd
Who led me coasting still wherever place
Along the rock was vacant as a man
Walks near the battlements on narrow wall
For those on th other part who drop by drop
Wring out their allinfecting malady
Too closely press the verge Accurst be thou
Inveterate wolf whose gorge ingluts more prey
Than every beast beside yet is not filld
So bottomless thy mawYe spheres of heaven
To whom there are as seems who attribute
All change in mortal state when is the day
Of his appearing for whom fate reserves
To chase her henceWith wary steps and slow
We passd and I attentive to the shades
Whom piteously I heard lament and wail

And midst the wailing one before us heard
Cry out O blessed Virgin as a dame
In the sharp pangs of childbed and How poor
Thou wast it added witness that low roof
Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down
O good Fabricius thou didst virtue choose
With poverty before great wealth with vice

The words so pleasd me that desire to know
The spirit from whose lip they seemd to come
Did draw me onward Yet it spake the gift
Of Nicholas which on the maidens he
Bounteous bestowd to save their youthful prime
Unblemishd Spirit who dost speak of deeds
So worthy tell me who thou was I said
And why thou dost with single voice renew
Memorial of such praise That boon vouchsafd
Haply shall meet reward if I return
To finish the Short pilgrimage of life
Still speeding to its close on restless wing

I answerd he will tell thee not for hell
Which thence I look for but that in thyself
Grace so exceeding shines before thy time
Of mortal dissolution I was root
Of that ill plant whose shade such poison sheds
Oer all the Christian land that seldom thence
Good fruit is gatherd Vengeance soon should come
Had Ghent and Douay Lille and Bruges power
And vengeance I of heavns great Judge implore
Hugh Capet was I high from me descend
The Philips and the Louis of whom France
Newly is governd born of one who plyd
The slaughterers trade at Paris When the race
Of ancient kings had vanishd all save one
Wrapt up in sable weeds within my gripe
I found the reins of empire and such powers
Of new acquirement with full store of friends
That soon the widowd circlet of the crown
Was girt upon the temples of my son
He from whose bones th anointed race begins
Till the great dower of Provence had removd
The stains that yet obscurd our lowly blood
Its sway indeed was narrow but howeer
It wrought no evil there with force and lies
Began its rapine after for amends
Poitou it seizd Navarre and Gascony
To Italy came Charles and for amends
Young Conradine an innocent victim slew
And sent th angelic teacher back to heavn
Still for amends I see the time at hand
That forth from France invites another Charles
To make himself and kindred better known
Unarmd he issues saving with that lance
Which the archtraitor tilted with and that
He carries with so home a thrust as rives
The bowels of poor Florence No increase
Of territory hence but sin and shame
Shall be his guerdon and so much the more
As he more lightly deems of such foul wrong
I see the other who a prisoner late
Had steps on shore exposing to the mart
His daughter whom he bargains for as do
The Corsairs for their slaves O avarice
What canst thou more who hast subdued our blood
So wholly to thyself they feel no care
Of their own flesh To hide with direr guilt
Past ill and future lo the flowerdeluce
Enters Alagna in his Vicar Christ
Himself a captive and his mockery
Acted again Lo to his holy lip
The vinegar and gall once more applied
And he twixt living robbers doomd to bleed
Lo the new Pilate of whose cruelty
Such violence cannot fill the measure up
With no degree to sanction pushes on
Into the temple his yet eager sails

O sovran Master when shall I rejoice
To see the vengeance which thy wrath wellpleasd
In secret silence broodsWhile daylight lasts
So long what thou didst hear of her sole spouse
Of the Great Spirit and on which thou turndst
To me for comment is the general theme
Of all our prayers but when it darkens then
A different strain we utter then record
Pygmalion whom his gluttonous thirst of gold
Made traitor robber parricide the woes
Of Midas which his greedy wish ensued
Markd for derision to all future times
And the fond Achan how he stole the prey
That yet he seems by Joshuas ire pursued
Sapphira with her husband next we blame
And praise the forefeet that with furious ramp
Spurnd Heliodorus All the mountain round
Rings with the infamy of Thracias king
Who slew his Phrygian charge and last a shout
Ascends Declare O Crassus for thou knowst
The flavour of thy gold The voice of each
Now high now low as each his impulse prompts
Is led through many a pitch acute or grave
Therefore not singly I erewhile rehearsd
That blessedness we tell of in the day
But near me none beside his accent raisd

From him we now had parted and essayd
With utmost efforts to surmount the way
When I did feel as nodding to its fall
The mountain tremble whence an icy chill
Seizd on me as on one to death conveyd
So shook not Delos when Latona there
Couchd to bring forth the twinborn eyes of heaven

Forthwith from every side a shout arose
So vehement that suddenly my guide
Drew near and cried Doubt not while I conduct thee
Glory all shouted such the sounds mine ear
Gatherd from those who near me swelld the sounds
Glory in the highest be to God We stood
Immovably suspended like to those
The shepherds who first heard in Bethlehems field
That song till ceasd the trembling and the song
Was ended then our hallowd path resumd
Eying the prostrate shadows who renewd
Their customd mourning Never in my breast
Did ignorance so struggle with desire
Of knowledge if my memory do not err
As in that moment nor through haste dard I
To question nor myself could aught discern
So on I fard in thoughtfulness and dread




CANTO XXI

The natural thirst neer quenchd but from the well
Whereof the woman of Samaria cravd
Excited haste along the cumberd path
After my guide impelld and pity movd
My bosom for the vengeful deed though just
When lo even as Luke relates that Christ
Appeard unto the two upon their way
Newrisen from his vaulted grave to us
A shade appeard and after us approachd
Contemplating the crowd beneath its feet
We were not ware of it so first it spake
Saying God give you peace my brethren then
Sudden we turnd and Virgil such salute
As fitted that kind greeting gave and cried
Peace in the blessed council be thy lot
Awarded by that righteous court which me
To everlasting banishment exiles

How he exclaimd nor from his speed meanwhile
Desisting If that ye be spirits whom God
Vouchsafes not room above who up the height
Has been thus far your guide To whom the bard
If thou observe the tokens which this man
Tracd by the finger of the angel bears
Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just
He needs must share But sithence she whose wheel
Spins day and night for him not yet had drawn
That yarn which on the fatal distaff pild
Clotho apportions to each wight that breathes
His soul that sister is to mine and thine
Not of herself could mount for not like ours
Her ken whence I from forth the ample gulf
Of hell was taen to lead him and will lead
Far as my lore avails But if thou know
Instruct us for what cause the mount erewhile
Thus shook and trembled wherefore all at once
Seemd shouting even from his wavewashd foot

That questioning so tallied with my wish
The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
Een from expectance He forthwith replied
In its devotion nought irregular
This mount can witness or by punctual rule
Unsanctiond here from every change exempt
Other than that which heaven in itself
Doth of itself receive no influence
Can reach us Tempest none shower hail or snow
Hoar frost or dewy moistness higher falls
Than that brief scale of threefold steps thick clouds
Nor scudding rack are ever seen swift glance
Neer lightens nor Thaumantian Iris gleams
That yonder often shift on each side heavn
Vapour adust doth never mount above
The highest of the trinal stairs whereon
Peters vicegerent stands Lower perchance
With various motion rockd trembles the soil
But here through wind in earths deep hollow pent
I know not how yet never trembled then
Trembles when any spirit feels itself
So purified that it may rise or move
For rising and such loud acclaim ensues
Purification by the will alone
Is provd that free to change society
Seizes the soul rejoicing in her will
Desire of bliss is present from the first
But strong propension hinders to that wish
By the just ordinance of heavn opposd
Propension now as eager to fulfil
Th allotted torment as erewhile to sin
And I who in this punishment had lain
Five hundred years and more but now have felt
Free wish for happier clime Therefore thou feltst
The mountain tremble and the spirits devout
Heardst over all his limits utter praise
To that liege Lord whom I entreat their joy
To hasten Thus he spake and since the draught
Is grateful ever as the thirst is keen
No words may speak my fullness of content

Now said the instructor sage I see the net
That takes ye here and how the toils are loosd
Why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice
Vouchsafe that from thy lips I next may learn
Who on the earth thou wast and wherefore here
So many an age wert prostrateIn that time
When the good Titus with Heavns King to help
Avengd those piteous gashes whence the blood
By Judas sold did issue with the name
Most lasting and most honourd there was I
Abundantly renownd the shade replyd
Not yet with faith endued So passing sweet
My vocal Spirit from Tolosa Rome
To herself drew me where I merited
A myrtle garland to inwreathe my brow
Statius they name me still Of Thebes I sang
And next of great Achilles but i th way
Fell with the second burthen Of my flame
Those sparkles were the seeds which I derivd
From the bright fountain of celestial fire
That feeds unnumberd lamps the song I mean
Which sounds Aeneas wandrings that the breast
I hung at that the nurse from whom my veins
Drank inspiration whose authority
Was ever sacred with me To have livd
Coeval with the Mantuan I would bide
The revolution of another sun
Beyond my stated years in banishment

The Mantuan when he heard him turnd to me
And holding silence by his countenance
Enjoind me silence but the power which wills
Bears not supreme control laughter and tears
Follow so closely on the passion prompts them
They wait not for the motions of the will
In natures most sincere I did but smile
As one who winks and thereupon the shade
Broke off and peerd into mine eyes where best
Our looks interpret So to good event
Mayst thou conduct such great emprize he cried
Say why across thy visage beamd but now
The lightning of a smile On either part
Now am I straitend one conjures me speak
Th other to silence binds me whence a sigh
I utter and the sigh is heard Speak on
The teacher cried and do not fear to speak
But tell him what so earnestly he asks
Whereon I thus Perchance O ancient spirit
Thou marvelst at my smiling There is room
For yet more wonder He who guides my ken
On high he is that Mantuan led by whom
Thou didst presume of men and gods to sing
If other cause thou deemdst for which I smild
Leave it as not the true one and believe
Those words thou spakst of him indeed the cause

Now down he bent t embrace my teachers feet
But he forbade him Brother do it not
Thou art a shadow and beholdst a shade
He rising answerd thus Now hast thou provd
The force and ardour of the love I bear thee
When I forget we are but things of air
And as a substance treat an empty shade




CANTO XXII

Now we had left the angel who had turnd
To the sixth circle our ascending step
One gash from off my forehead razd while they
Whose wishes tend to justice shouted forth
Blessed and ended with I thirst and I
More nimble than along the other straits
So journeyd that without the sense of toil
I followd upward the swiftfooted shades
When Virgil thus began Let its pure flame
From virtue flow and love can never fail
To warm anothers bosom so the light
Shine manifestly forth Hence from that hour
When mongst us in the purlieus of the deep
Came down the spirit of Aquinums hard
Who told of thine affection my good will
Hath been for thee of quality as strong
As ever linkd itself to one not seen
Therefore these stairs will now seem short to me
But tell me and if too secure I loose
The rein with a friends license as a friend
Forgive me and speak now as with a friend
How chancd it covetous desire could find
Place in that bosom midst such ample store
Of wisdom as thy zeal had treasurd there

First somewhat movd to laughter by his words
Statius replied Each syllable of thine
Is a dear pledge of love Things oft appear
That minister false matters to our doubts
When their true causes are removd from sight
Thy question doth assure me thou believst
I was on earth a covetous man perhaps
Because thou foundst me in that circle placd
Know then I was too wide of avarice
And een for that excess thousands of moons
Have waxd and wand upon my sufferings
And were it not that I with heedful care
Noted where thou exclaimst as if in ire
With human nature Why thou cursed thirst
Of gold dost not with juster measure guide
The appetite of mortals I had met
The fierce encounter of the voluble rock
Then was I ware that with too ample wing
The hands may haste to lavishment and turnd
As from my other evil so from this
In penitence How many from their grave
Shall with shorn locks arise who living aye
And at lifes last extreme of this offence
Through ignorance did not repent And know
The fault which lies direct from any sin
In level opposition here With that
Wastes its green rankness on one common heap
Therefore if I have been with those who wail
Their avarice to cleanse me through reverse
Of their transgression such hath been my lot

To whom the sovran of the pastoral song
While thou didst sing that cruel warfare wagd
By the twin sorrow of Jocastas womb
From thy discourse with Clio there it seems
As faith had not been shine without the which
Good deeds suffice not And if so what sun
Rose on thee or what candle piercd the dark
That thou didst after see to hoist the sail
And follow where the fisherman had led

He answering thus By thee conducted first
I enterd the Parnassian grots and quaffd
Of the clear spring illumind first by thee
Opend mine eyes to God Thou didst as one
Who journeying through the darkness hears a light
Behind that profits not himself but makes
His followers wise when thou exclaimedst Lo
A renovated world Justice returnd
Times of primeval innocence restord
And a new race descended from above
Poet and Christian both to thee I owed
That thou mayst mark more clearly what I trace
My hand shall stretch forth to inform the lines
With livelier colouring Soon oer all the world
By messengers from heavn the true belief
Teemd now prolific and that word of thine
Accordant to the new instructors chimd
Inducd by which agreement I was wont
Resort to them and soon their sanctity
So won upon me that Domitians rage
Pursuing them I mixd my tears with theirs
And while on earth I stayd still succourd them
And their most righteous customs made me scorn
All sects besides Before I led the Greeks
In tuneful fiction to the streams of Thebes
I was baptizd but secretly through fear
Remaind a Christian and conformd long time
To Pagan rites Five centuries and more
T for that lukewarmness was fain to pace
Round the fourth circle Thou then who hast raisd
The covering which did hide such blessing from me
Whilst much of this ascent is yet to climb
Say if thou know where our old Terence bides
Caecilius Plautus Varro if condemnd
They dwell and in what province of the deep
These said my guide with Persius and myself
And others many more are with that Greek
Of mortals the most cherishd by the Nine
In the first ward of darkness There ofttimes
We of that mount hold converse on whose top
For aye our nurses live We have the bard
Of Pella and the Teian Agatho
Simonides and many a Grecian else
Ingarlanded with laurel Of thy train
Antigone is there Deiphile
Argia and as sorrowful as erst
Ismene and who showd Langias wave
Deidamia with her sisters there
And blind Tiresias daughter and the bride
Seaborn of Peleus Either poet now
Was silent and no longer by th ascent
Or the steep walls obstructed round them cast
Inquiring eyes Four handmaids of the day
Had finishd now their office and the fifth
Was at the chariotbeam directing still
Its balmy point aloof when thus my guide
Methinks it well behooves us to the brink
Bend the right shoulder circuiting the mount
As we have ever usd So custom there
Was usher to the road the which we chose
Less doubtful as that worthy shade complied

They on before me went I sole pursued
Listning their speech that to my thoughts conveyd
Mysterious lessons of sweet poesy
But soon they ceasd for midway of the road
A tree we found with goodly fruitage hung
And pleasant to the smell and as a fir
Upward from bough to bough less ample spreads
So downward this less ample spread that none
Methinks aloft may climb Upon the side
That closd our path a liquid crystal fell
From the steep rock and through the sprays above
Streamd showering With associate step the bards
Drew near the plant and from amidst the leaves
A voice was heard Ye shall be chary of me
And after added Mary took more thought
For joy and honour of the nuptial feast
Than for herself who answers now for you
The women of old Rome were satisfied
With water for their beverage Daniel fed
On pulse and wisdom gaind The primal age
Was beautiful as gold and hunger then
Made acorns tasteful thirst each rivulet
Run nectar Honey and locusts were the food
Whereon the Baptist in the wilderness
Fed and that eminence of glory reachd
And greatness which the Evangelist records




CANTO XXIII

On the green leaf mine eyes were fixd like his
Who throws away his days in idle chase
Of the diminutive when thus I heard
The more than father warn me Son our time
Asks thriftier using Linger not away

Thereat my face and steps at once I turnd
Toward the sages by whose converse cheerd
I journeyd on and felt no toil and lo
A sound of weeping and a song My lips
O Lord and these so mingled it gave birth
To pleasure and to pain O Sire belovd
Say what is this I hear Thus I inquird

Spirits said he who as they go perchance
Their debt of duty pay As on their road
The thoughtful pilgrims overtaking some
Not known unto them turn to them and look
But stay not thus approaching from behind
With speedier motion eyed us as they passd
A crowd of spirits silent and devout
The eyes of each were dark and hollow pale
Their visage and so lean withal the bones
Stood staring thro the skin I do not think
Thus dry and meagre Erisicthon showd
When pinced by sharpset famine to the quick

Lo to myself I musd the race who lost
Jerusalem when Mary with dire beak
Preyd on her child The sockets seemd as rings
From which the gems were drops Who reads the name
Of man upon his forehead there the M
Had tracd most plainly Who would deem that scent
Of water and an apple could have provd
Powerful to generate such pining want
Not knowing how it wrought While now I stood
Wondring what thus could waste them for the cause
Of their gaunt hollowness and scaly rind
Appeard not lo a spirit turnd his eyes
In their deepsunken cell and fastend then
On me then cried with vehemence aloud
What grace is this vouchsafd me By his looks
I neer had recognizd him but the voice
Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceald
Remembrance of his alterd lineaments
Was kindled from that spark and I agnizd
The visage of Forese Ah respect
This wan and leprous witherd skin thus he
Suppliant implord this macerated flesh
Speak to me truly of thyself And who
Are those twain spirits that escort thee there
Be it not said thou Scornst to talk with me

That face of thine I answerd him which dead
I once bewaild disposes me not less
For weeping when I see It thus transformd
Say then by Heavn what blasts ye thus The whilst
I wonder ask not Speech from me unapt
Is he to speak whom other will employs

He thus The water and tee plant we passd
Virtue possesses by th eternal will
Infusd the which so pines me Every spirit
Whose song bewails his gluttony indulgd
Too grossly here in hunger and in thirst
Is purified The odour which the fruit
And spray that showers upon the verdure breathe
Inflames us with desire to feed and drink
Nor once alone encompassing our route
We come to add fresh fuel to the pain
Pain said Iolace rather for that will
To the tree leads us by which Christ was led
To call Elias joyful when he paid
Our ransom from his vein I answering thus
Forese from that day in which the world
For better life thou changedst not five years
Have circled If the power of sinning more
Were first concluded in thee ere thou knewst
That kindly grief which reespouses us
To God how hither art thou come so soon
I thought to find thee lower there where time
Is recompense for time He straight replied
To drink up the sweet wormwood of affliction
I have been brought thus early by the tears
Streamd down my Nellas cheeks Her prayers devout
Her sighs have drawn me from the coast where oft
Expectance lingers and have set me free
From th other circles In the sight of God
So much the dearer is my widow prizd
She whom I lovd so fondly as she ranks
More singly eminent for virtuous deeds
The tract most barbrous of Sardinias isle
Hath dames more chaste and modester by far
Than that wherein I left her O sweet brother
What wouldst thou have me say A time to come
Stands full within my view to which this hour
Shall not be counted of an ancient date
When from the pulpit shall be loudly warnd
Th unblushing dames of Florence lest they bare
Unkerchiefd bosoms to the common gaze
What savage women hath the world eer seen
What Saracens for whom there needed scourge
Of spiritual or other discipline
To force them walk with covring on their limbs
But did they see the shameless ones that Heavn
Wafts on swift wing toward them while I speak
Their mouths were opd for howling they shall taste
Of Borrow unless foresight cheat me here
Or ere the cheek of him be clothd with down
Who is now rockd with lullaby asleep
Ah now my brother hide thyself no more
Thou seest how not I alone but all
Gaze where thou veilst the intercepted sun

Whence I replied If thou recall to mind
What we were once together even yet
Remembrance of those days may grieve thee sore
That I forsook that life was due to him
Who there precedes me some few evenings past
When she was round who shines with sister lamp
To his that glisters yonder and I showd
The sun Tis he who through profoundest night
Of he true dead has brought me with this flesh
As true that follows From that gloom the aid
Of his sure comfort drew me on to climb
And climbing wind along this mountainsteep
Which rectifies in you whateer the world
Made crooked and depravd I have his word
That he will bear me company as far
As till I come where Beatrice dwells
But there must leave me Virgil is that spirit
Who thus hath promisd and I pointed to him
The other is that shade for whom so late
Your realm as he arose exulting shook
Through every pendent cliff and rocky bound




CANTO XXIV

Our journey was not slackend by our talk
Nor yet our talk by journeying Still we spake
And urgd our travel stoutly like a ship
When the wind sits astern The shadowy forms

That seemd things dead and dead again drew in
At their deepdelved orbs rare wonder of me
Perceiving I had life and I my words
Continued and thus spake He journeys up
Perhaps more tardily then else he would
For others sake But tell me if thou knowst
Where is Piccarda Tell me if I see
Any of mark among this multitude
Who eye me thusMy sister she for whom
Twixt beautiful and good I cannot say
Which name was fitter  wears een now her crown
And triumphs in Olympus Saying this
He added Since spare diet hath so worn
Our semblance out t is lawful here to name
Each one This and his finger then he raisd
Is BuonaggiunaBuonaggiuna he
Of Lucca and that face beyond him piercd
Unto a leaner fineness than the rest
Had keeping of the church he was of Tours
And purges by wan abstinence away
Bolsenas eels and cups of muscadel

He showd me many others one by one
And all as they were namd seemd well content
For no dark gesture I discernd in any
I saw through hunger Ubaldino grind
His teeth on emptiness and Boniface
That wavd the crozier oer a numrous flock
I saw the Marquis who tad time erewhile
To swill at Forli with less drought yet so
Was one neer sated I howeer like him
That gazing midst a crowd singles out one
So singled him of Lucca for methought
Was none amongst them took such note of me
Somewhat I heard him whisper of Gentucca
The sound was indistinct and murmurd there
Where justice that so strips them fixd her sting

Spirit said I it seems as thou wouldst fain
Speak with me Let me hear thee Mutual wish
To converse prompts which let us both indulge

He answring straight began Woman is born
Whose brow no wimple shades yet that shall make
My city please thee blame it as they may
Go then with this forewarning If aught false
My whisper too implied th event shall tell
But say if of a truth I see the man
Of that new lay th inventor which begins
With Ladies ye that con the lore of love

To whom I thus Count of me but as one
Who am the scribe of love that when he breathes
Take up my pen and as he dictates write

Brother said he the hindrance which once held
The notary with Guittone and myself
Short of that new and sweeter style I hear
Is now disclosd I see how ye your plumes
Stretch as th inditer guides them which no question
Ours did not He that seeks a grace beyond
Sees not the distance parts one style from other
And as contented here he held his peace

Like as the bird that winter near the Nile
In squared regiment direct their course
Then stretch themselves in file for speedier flight
Thus all the tribe of spirits as they turnd
Their visage faster deaf nimble alike
Through leanness and desire And as a man
Tird With the motion of a trotting steed
Slacks pace and stays behind his company
Till his oerbreathed lungs keep temperate time
Een so Forese let that holy crew
Proceed behind them lingering at my side
And saying When shall I again behold thee

How long my life may last said I I know not
This know how soon soever I return
My wishes will before me have arrivd
Sithence the place where I am set to live
Is day by day more scoopd of all its good
And dismal ruin seems to threaten it

Go now he cried lo he whose guilt is most
Passes before my vision draggd at heels
Of an infuriate beast Toward the vale
Where guilt hath no redemption on it speeds
Each step increasing swiftness on the last
Until a blow it strikes that leaveth him
A corse most vilely shatterd No long space
Those wheels have yet to roll therewith his eyes
Lookd up to heavn ere thou shalt plainly see
That which my words may not more plainly tell
I quit thee time is precious here I lose
Too much thus measuring my pace with shine

As from a troop of wellrankd chivalry
One knight more enterprising than the rest
Pricks forth at gallop eager to display
His prowess in the first encounter provd
So parted he from us with lengthend strides
And left me on the way with those twain spirits
Who were such mighty marshals of the world

When he beyond us had so fled mine eyes
No nearer reachd him than my thought his words
The branches of another fruit thick hung
And blooming fresh appeard Een as our steps
Turnd thither not far off it rose to view
Beneath it were a multitude that raisd
Their hands and shouted forth I know not What
Unto the boughs like greedy and fond brats
That beg and answer none obtain from him
Of whom they beg but more to draw them on
He at arms length the object of their wish
Above them holds aloft and hides it not

At length as undeceivd they went their way
And we approach the tree who vows and tears
Sue to in vain the mighty tree Pass on
And come not near Stands higher up the wood
Whereof Eve tasted and from it was taen
this plant Such sounds from midst the thickets came
Whence I with either bard close to the side
That rose passd forth beyond Remember next
We heard those noblest creatures of the clouds
How they their twofold bosoms overgorgd
Opposd in fight to Theseus call to mind
The Hebrews how effeminate they stoopd
To ease their thirst whence Gideons ranks were thinnd
As he to Midian marchd adown the hills

Thus near one border coasting still we heard
The sins of gluttony with woe erewhile
Reguerdond Then along the lonely path
Once more at large full thousand paces on
We traveld each contemplative and mute

Why pensive journey thus ye three alone
Thus suddenly a voice exclaimd whereat
I shook as doth a scard and paltry beast
Then raisd my head to look from whence it came

Was neer in furnace glass or metal seen
So bright and glowing red as was the shape
I now beheld If ye desire to mount
He cried here must ye turn This way he goes
Who goes in quest of peace His countenance
Had dazzled me and to my guides I facd
Backward like one who walks as sound directs

As when to harbinger the dawn springs up
On freshend wing the air of May and breathes
Of fragrance all impregnd with herb and flowers
Een such a wind I felt upon my front
Blow gently and the moving of a wing
Perceivd that moving shed ambrosial smell
And then a voice Blessed are they whom grace
Doth so illume that appetite in them
Exhaleth no inordinate desire
Still hungring as the rule of temperance wills




CANTO XXV

It was an hour when he who climbs had need
To walk uncrippled for the sun had now
To Taurus the meridian circle left
And to the Scorpion left the night As one
That makes no pause but presses on his road
Whateer betide him if some urgent need
Impel so enterd we upon our way
One before other for but singly none
That steep and narrow scale admits to climb

Een as the young stork lifteth up his wing
Through wish to fly yet ventures not to quit
The nest and drops it so in me desire
Of questioning my guide arose and fell
Arriving even to the act that marks
A man prepard for speech Him all our haste
Restraind not but thus spake the sire belovd
Fear not to speed the shaft that on thy lip
Stands trembling for its flight Encouragd thus
I straight began How there can leanness come
Where is no want of nourishment to feed

If thou he answerd hadst rememberd thee
How Meleager with the wasting brand
Wasted alike by equal fires consumd
This would not trouble thee and hadst thou thought
How in the mirror your reflected form
With mimic motion vibrates what now seems
Hard had appeard no harder than the pulp
Of summer fruit mature But that thy will
In certainty may find its full repose
Lo Statius here on him I call and pray
That he would now be healer of thy wound

If in thy presence I unfold to him
The secrets of heavens vengeance let me plead
Thine own injunction to exculpate me
So Statius answerd and forthwith began
Attend my words O son and in thy mind
Receive them so shall they be light to clear
The doubt thou offerst Blood concocted well
Which by the thirsty veins is neer imbibd
And rests as food superfluous to be taen
From the replenishd table in the heart
Derives effectual virtue that informs
The several human limbs as being that
Which passes through the veins itself to make them
Yet more concocted it descends where shame
Forbids to mention and from thence distils
In natural vessel on anothers blood
Then each unite together one disposd
T endure to act the other through meet frame
Of its recipient mould that being reachd
It gins to work coagulating first
Then vivifies what its own substance causd
To bear With animation now indued
The active virtue differing from a plant
No further than that this is on the way
And at its limit that continues yet
To operate that now it moves and feels
As sea sponge clinging to the rock and there
Assumes th organic powers its seed conveyd
This is the period son at which the virtue
That from the generating heart proceeds
Is pliant and expansive for each limb
Is in the heart by forgeful nature plannd
How babe of animal becomes remains
For thy considring At this point more wise
Than thou hast errd making the soul disjoind
From passive intellect because he saw
No organ for the latters use assignd

Open thy bosom to the truth that comes
Know soon as in the embryo to the brain
Articulation is complete then turns
The primal Mover with a smile of joy
On such great work of nature and imbreathes
New spirit replete with virtue that what here
Active it finds to its own substance draws
And forms an individual soul that lives
And feels and bends reflective on itself
And that thou less mayst marvel at the word
Mark the suns heat how that to wine doth change
Mixd with the moisture filterd through the vine

When Lachesis hath spun the thread the soul
Takes with her both the human and divine
Memory intelligence and will in act
Far keener than before the other powers
Inactive all and mute No pause allowd
In wondrous sort selfmoving to one strand
Of those where the departed roam she falls
Here learns her destind path Soon as the place
Receives her round the plastic virtue beams
Distinct as in the living limbs before
And as the air when saturate with showers
The casual beam refracting decks itself
With many a hue so here the ambient air
Weareth that form which influence of the soul
Imprints on it and like the flame that where
The fire moves thither follows so henceforth
The new form on the spirit follows still
Hence hath it semblance and is shadow calld
With each sense even to the sight endued
Hence speech is ours hence laughter tears and sighs
Which thou mayst oft have witnessd on the mount
Th obedient shadow fails not to present
Whatever varying passion moves within us
And this the cause of what thou marvelst at

Now the last flexure of our way we reachd
And to the right hand turning other care
Awaits us Here the rocky precipice
Hurls forth redundant flames and from the rim
A blast upblown with forcible rebuff
Driveth them back sequesterd from its bound

Behoovd us one by one along the side
That borderd on the void to pass and I
Feard on one hand the fire on th other feard
Headlong to fall when thus th instructor warnd
Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes
A little swerving and the way is lost

Then from the bosom of the burning mass
O God of mercy heard I sung and felt
No less desire to turn And when I saw
Spirits along the flame proceeding I
Between their footsteps and mine own was fain
To share by turns my view At the hymns close
They shouted loud I do not know a man
Then in low voice again took up the strain
Which once more ended To the wood they cried
Ran Dian and drave forth Callisto stung
With Cythereas poison then returnd
Unto their song then marry a pair extolld
Who livd in virtue chastely and the bands
Of wedded love Nor from that task I ween
Surcease they whilesoeer the scorching fire
Enclasps them Of such skill appliance needs
To medicine the wound that healeth last


CANTO XXVI

While singly thus along the rim we walkd
Oft the good master warnd me Look thou well
Avail it that I caution thee The sun
Now all the western clime irradiate changd
From azure tinct to white and as I passd
My passing shadow made the umberd flame
Burn ruddier At so strange a sight I markd
That many a spirit marveld on his way

This bred occasion first to speak of me
He seems said they no insubstantial frame
Then to obtain what certainty they might
Stretchd towards me careful not to overpass
The burning pale O thou who followest
The others haply not more slow than they
But movd by revrence answer me who burn
In thirst and fire nor I alone but these
All for thine answer do more thirst than doth
Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream
Tell us how is it that thou makst thyself
A wall against the sun as thou not yet
Into th inextricable toils of death
Hadst enterd Thus spake one and I had straight
Declard me if attention had not turnd
To new appearance Meeting these there came
Midway the burning path a crowd on whom
Earnestly gazing from each part I view
The shadows all press forward sevrally
Each snatch a hasty kiss and then away
Een so the emmets mid their dusky troops
Peer closely one at other to spy out
Their mutual road perchance and how they thrive

That friendly greeting parted ere dispatch
Of the first onward step from either tribe
Loud clamour rises those who newly come
Shout Sodom and Gomorrah these The cow
Pasiphae enterd that the beast she wood
Might rush unto her luxury Then as cranes
That part towards the Riphaean mountains fly
Part towards the Lybic sands these to avoid
The ice and those the sun so hasteth off
One crowd advances th other and resume
Their first song weeping and their several shout

Again drew near my side the very same
Who had erewhile besought me and their looks
Markd eagerness to listen I who twice
Their will had noted spake O spirits secure
Wheneer the time may be of peaceful end
My limbs nor crude nor in mature old age
Have I left yonder here they bear me fed
With blood and sinewstrung That I no more
May live in blindness hence I tend aloft
There is a dame on high who wind for us
This grace by which my mortal through your realm
I bear But may your utmost wish soon meet
Such full fruition that the orb of heaven
Fullest of love and of most ample space
Receive you as ye tell upon my page
Henceforth to stand recorded who ye are
And what this multitude that at your backs
Have past behind us As one mountainbred
Rugged and clownish if some citys walls
He chance to enter round him stares agape
Confounded and struck dumb een such appeard
Each spirit But when rid of that amaze
Not long the inmate of a noble heart
He who before had questiond thus resumd
O blessed who for death preparing takst
Experience of our limits in thy bark
Their crime who not with us proceed was that
For which as he did triumph Caesar heard
The snout of queen to taunt him Hence their cry
Of Sodom as they parted to rebuke
Themselves and aid the burning by their shame
Our sinning was Hermaphrodite but we
Because the law of human kind we broke
Following like beasts our vile concupiscence
Hence parting from them to our own disgrace
Record the name of her by whom the beast
In bestial tire was acted Now our deeds
Thou knowst and how we sinnd If thou by name
Wouldst haply know us time permits not now
To tell so much nor can I Of myself
Learn what thou wishest Guinicelli I
Who having truly sorrowd ere my last
Already cleanse me With such pious joy
As the two sons upon their mother gazd
From sad Lycurgus rescud such my joy
Save that I more represt it when I heard
From his own lips the name of him pronouncd
Who was a father to me and to those
My betters who have ever usd the sweet
And pleasant rhymes of love So nought I heard
Nor spake but long time thoughtfully I went
Gazing on him and only for the fire
Approachd not nearer When my eyes were fed
By looking on him with such solemn pledge
As forces credence I devoted me
Unto his service wholly In reply
He thus bespake me What from thee I hear
Is gravd so deeply on my mind the waves
Of Lethe shall not wash it off nor make
A whit less lively But as now thy oath
Has seald the truth declare what cause impels
That love which both thy looks and speech bewray

Those dulcet lays I answerd which as long
As of our tongue the beauty does not fade
Shall make us love the very ink that tracd them

Brother he cried and pointed at a shade
Before him there is one whose mother speech
Doth owe to him a fairer ornament
He in love ditties and the tales of prose
Without a rival stands and lets the fools
Talk on who think the songster of Limoges
Oertops him Rumour and the popular voice
They look to more than truth and so confirm
Opinion ere by art or reason taught
Thus many of the elder time cried up
Guittone giving him the prize till truth
By strength of numbers vanquishd If thou own
So ample privilege as to have gaind
Free entrance to the cloister whereof Christ
Is Abbot of the college say to him
One paternoster for me far as needs
For dwellers in this world where power to sin
No longer tempts us Haply to make way
For one that followd next when that was said
He vanishd through the fire as through the wave
A fish that glances diving to the deep

I to the spirit he had shown me drew
A little onward and besought his name
For which my heart I said kept gracious room
He frankly thus began Thy courtesy
So wins on me I have nor power nor will
To hide me I am Arnault and with songs
Sorely lamenting for my folly past
Thorough this ford of fire I wade and see
The day I hope for smiling in my view
I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up
Unto the summit of the scale in time
Remember ye my suffrings With such words
He disappeard in the refining flame




CANTO XXVII

Now was the sun so stationd as when first
His early radiance quivers on the heights
Where streamd his Makers blood while Libra hangs
Above Hesperian Ebro and new fires
Meridian flash on Ganges yellow tide

So day was sinking when the angel of God
Appeard before us Joy was in his mien
Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink
And with a voice whose lively clearness far
Surpassd our human Blessed are the pure
In heart he Sang then near him as we came
Go ye not further holy spirits he cried
Ere the fire pierce you enter in and list
Attentive to the song ye hear from thence

I when I heard his saying was as one
Laid in the grave My hands together claspd
And upward stretching on the fire I lookd
And busy fancy conjurd up the forms
Erewhile beheld alive consumd in flames

Th escorting spirits turnd with gentle looks
Toward me and the Mantuan spake My son
Here torment thou mayst feel but canst not death
Remember thee remember thee if I
Safe een on Geryon brought thee now I come
More near to God wilt thou not trust me now
Of this be sure though in its womb that flame
A thousand years containd thee from thy head
No hair should perish If thou doubt my truth
Approach and with thy hands thy vestures hem
Stretch forth and for thyself confirm belief
Lay now all fear O lay all fear aside
Turn hither and come onward undismayd
I still though conscience urgd no step advancd

When still he saw me fixd and obstinate
Somewhat disturbd he cried Mark now my son
From Beatrice thou art by this wall
Divided As at Thisbes name the eye
Of Pyramus was opend when life ebbd
Fast from his veins and took one parting glance
While vermeil dyed the mulberry thus I turnd
To my sage guide relenting when I heard
The name that springs forever in my breast

He shook his forehead and How long he said
Linger we now then smild as one would smile
Upon a child that eyes the fruit and yields
Into the fire before me then he walkd
And Statius who erewhile no little space
Had parted us he prayd to come behind

I would have cast me into molten glass
To cool me when I enterd so intense
Ragd the conflagrant mass The sire belovd
To comfort me as he proceeded still
Of Beatrice talkd Her eyes saith he
Een now I seem to view From the other side
A voice that sang did guide us and the voice
Following with heedful ear we issued forth
There where the path led upward Come we heard
Come blessed of my Father Such the sounds
That haild us from within a light which shone
So radiant I could not endure the view
The sun it added hastes and evening comes
Delay not ere the western sky is hung
With blackness strive ye for the pass Our way
Upright within the rock arose and facd
Such part of heavn that from before my steps
The beams were shrouded of the sinking sun

Nor many stairs were overpass when now
By fading of the shadow we perceivd
The sun behind us couchd and ere one face
Of darkness oer its measureless expanse
Involvd th horizon and the night her lot
Held individual each of us had made
A stair his pallet not that will but power
Had faild us by the nature of that mount
Forbidden further travel As the goats
That late have skippd and wantond rapidly
Upon the craggy cliffs ere they had taen
Their supper on the herb now silent lie
And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown
While noonday rages and the goatherd leans
Upon his staff and leaning watches them
And as the swain that lodges out all night
In quiet by his flock lest beast of prey
Disperse them even so all three abode
I as a goat and as the shepherds they
Close pent on either side by shelving rock

A little glimpse of sky was seen above
Yet by that little I beheld the stars
In magnitude and rustle shining forth
With more than wonted glory As I lay
Gazing on them and in that fit of musing
Sleep overcame me sleep that bringeth oft
Tidings of future hap About the hour
As I believe when Venus from the east
First lightend on the mountain she whose orb
Seems always glowing with the fire of love
A lady young and beautiful I dreamd
Was passing oer a lea and as she came
Methought I saw her ever and anon
Bending to cull the flowers and thus she sang
Know ye whoever of my name would ask
That I am Leah for my brow to weave
A garland these fair hands unwearied ply
To please me at the crystal mirror here
I deck me But my sister Rachel she
Before her glass abides the livelong day
Her radiant eyes beholding charmd no less
Than I with this delightful task Her joy
In contemplation as in labour mine

And now as glimmring dawn appeard that breaks
More welcome to the pilgrim still as he
Sojourns less distant on his homeward way
Darkness from all sides fled and with it fled
My slumber whence I rose and saw my guide
Already risen That delicious fruit
Which through so many a branch the zealous care
Of mortals roams in quest of shall this day
Appease thy hunger Such the words I heard
From Virgils lip and never greeting heard
So pleasant as the sounds Within me straight
Desire so grew upon desire to mount
Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings
Increasing for my flight When we had run
Oer all the ladder to its topmost round
As there we stood on me the Mantuan fixd
His eyes and thus he spake Both fires my son
The temporal and eternal thou hast seen
And art arrivd where of itself my ken
No further reaches I with skill and art
Thus far have drawn thee Now thy pleasure take
For guide Thou hast oercome the steeper way
Oercome the straighter Lo the sun that darts
His beam upon thy forehead lo the herb
The arboreta and flowers which of itself
This land pours forth profuse Will those bright eyes
With gladness come which weeping made me haste
To succour thee thou mayst or seat thee down
Or wander where thou wilt Expect no more
Sanction of warning voice or sign from me
Free of thy own arbitrement to choose
Discreet judicious To distrust thy sense
Were henceforth error I invest thee then
With crown and mitre sovereign oer thyself




CANTO XXVIII

Through that celestial forest whose thick shade
With lively greenness the newspringing day
Attemperd eager now to roam and search
Its limits round forthwith I left the bank
Along the champain leisurely my way
Pursuing oer the ground that on all sides
Delicious odour breathd A pleasant air
That intermitted never never veerd
Smote on my temples gently as a wind
Of softest influence at which the sprays
Obedient all leand trembling to that part
Where first the holy mountain casts his shade
Yet were not so disorderd but that still
Upon their top the featherd quiristers
Applied their wonted art and with full joy
Welcomd those hours of prime and warbled shrill
Amid the leaves that to their jocund lays
inept tenor even as from branch to branch
Along the piney forests on the shore
Of Chiassi rolls the gathring melody
When Eolus hath from his cavern loosd
The dripping south Already had my steps
Though slow so far into that ancient wood
Transported me I could not ken the place
Where I had enterd when behold my path
Was bounded by a rill which to the left
With little rippling waters bent the grass
That issued from its brink On earth no wave
How clean soeer that would not seem to have
Some mixture in itself compard with this
Transpicuous clear yet darkly on it rolld
Darkly beneath perpetual gloom which neer
Admits or sun or moon light there to shine

My feet advancd not but my wondring eyes
Passd onward oer the streamlet to survey
The tender Maybloom flushd through many a hue
In prodigal variety and there
As object rising suddenly to view
That from our bosom every thought beside
With the rare marvel chases I beheld
A lady all alone who singing went
And culling flower from flower wherewith her way
Was all oer painted Lady beautiful
Thou who if looks that use to speak the heart
Are worthy of our trust with loves own beam
Dost warm thee thus to her my speech I framd
Ah please thee hither towards the streamlet bend
Thy steps so near that I may list thy song
Beholding thee and this fair place methinks
I call to mind where wanderd and how lookd
Proserpine in that season when her child
The mother lost and she the bloomy spring

As when a lady turning in the dance
Doth foot it featly and advances scarce
One step before the other to the ground
Over the yellow and vermilion flowers
Thus turnd she at my suit most maidenlike
Valing her sober eyes and came so near
That I distinctly caught the dulcet sound
Arriving where the limped waters now
Lavd the green sward her eyes she deignd to raise
That shot such splendour on me as I ween
Neer glanced from Cythereas when her son
Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart
Upon the opposite bank she stood and smild
through her graceful fingers shifted still
The intermingling dyes which without seed
That lofty land unbosoms By the stream
Three paces only were we sunderd yet
The Hellespont where Xerxes passd it oer
A curb for ever to the pride of man
Was by Leander not more hateful held
For floating with inhospitable wave
Twixt Sestus and Abydos than by me
That flood because it gave no passage thence

Strangers ye come and haply in this place
That cradled human nature in its birth
Wondring ye not without suspicion view
My smiles but that sweet strain of psalmody
Thou Lord hast made me glad will give ye light
Which may uncloud your minds And thou who standst
The foremost and didst make thy suit to me
Say if aught else thou wish to hear for I
Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine

She spake and I replied I know not how
To reconcile this wave and rustling sound
Of forest leaves with what I late have heard
Of opposite report She answering thus
I will unfold the cause whence that proceeds
Which makes thee wonder and so purge the cloud
That hath enwraps thee The First Good whose joy
Is only in himself created man
For happiness and gave this goodly place
His pledge and earnest of eternal peace
Favourd thus highly through his own defect
He fell and here made short sojourn he fell
And for the bitterness of sorrow changd
Laughter unblamd and evernew delight
That vapours none exhald from earth beneath
Or from the waters which wherever heat
Attracts them follow might ascend thus far
To vex mans peaceful state this mountain rose
So high toward the heavn nor fears the rage
Of elements contending from that part
Exempted where the gate his limit bars
Because the circumambient air throughout
With its first impulse circles still unless
Aught interpose to cheek or thwart its course
Upon the summit which on every side
To visitation of th impassive air
Is open doth that motion strike and makes
Beneath its sway th umbrageous wood resound
And in the shaken plant such power resides
That it impregnates with its efficacy
The voyaging breeze upon whose subtle plume
That wafted flies abroad and th other land
Receiving as t is worthy in itself
Or in the clime that warms it doth conceive
And from its womb produces many a tree
Of various virtue This when thou hast heard
The marvel ceases if in yonder earth
Some plant without apparent seed be found
To fix its fibrous stem And further learn
That with prolific foison of all seeds
This holy plain is filld and in itself
Bears fruit that neer was pluckd on other soil

The water thou beholdst springs not from vein
As stream that intermittently repairs
And spends his pulse of life but issues forth
From fountain solid undecaying sure
And by the will omnific full supply
Feeds whatsoeer On either side it pours
On this devolvd with power to take away
Remembrance of offence on that to bring
Remembrance back of every good deed done
From whence its name of Lethe on this part
On th other Eunoe both of which must first
Be tasted ere it work the last exceeding
All flavours else Albeit thy thirst may now
Be well contented if I here break off
No more revealing yet a corollary
I freely give beside nor deem my words
Less grateful to thee if they somewhat pass
The stretch of promise They whose verse of yore
The golden age recorded and its bliss
On the Parnassian mountain of this place
Perhaps had dreamd Here was man guiltless here
Perpetual spring and every fruit and this
The farfamd nectar Turning to the bards
When she had ceasd I noted in their looks
A smile at her conclusion then my face
Again directed to the lovely dame




CANTO XXIX

Singing as if enamourd she resumd
And closd the song with Blessed they whose sins
Are coverd Like the woodnymphs then that trippd
Singly across the sylvan shadows one
Eager to view and one to scape the sun
So movd she on against the current up
The verdant rivage I her mincing step
Observing with as tardy step pursued

Between us not an hundred paces trod
The bank on each side bending equally
Gave me to face the orient Nor our way
Far onward brought us when to me at once
She turnd and cried My brother look and hearken
And lo a sudden lustre ran across
Through the great forest on all parts so bright
I doubted whether lightning were abroad
But that expiring ever in the spleen
That doth unfold it and this during still
And waxing still in splendor made me question
What it might be and a sweet melody
Ran through the luminous air Then did I chide
With warrantable zeal the hardihood
Of our first parent for that there were earth
Stood in obedience to the heavns she only
Woman the creature of an hour endurd not
Restraint of any veil which had she borne
Devoutly joys ineffable as these
Had from the first and long time since been mine

While through that wilderness of primy sweets
That never fade suspense I walkd and yet
Expectant of beatitude more high
Before us like a blazing fire the air
Under the green boughs glowd and for a song
Distinct the sound of melody was heard

O ye thrice holy virgins for your sakes
If eer I sufferd hunger cold and watching
Occasion calls on me to crave your bounty
Now through my breast let Helicon his stream
Pour copious and Urania with her choir
Arise to aid me while the verse unfolds
Things that do almost mock the grasp of thought

Onward a space what seemd seven trees of gold
The intervening distance to mine eye
Falsely presented but when I was come
So near them that no lineament was lost
Of those with which a doubtful object seen
Remotely plays on the misdeeming sense
Then did the faculty that ministers
Discourse to reason these for tapers of gold
Distinguish and it th singing trace the sound
Hosanna Above their beauteous garniture
Flamd with more ample lustre than the moon
Through cloudless sky at midnight in her full

I turnd me full of wonder to my guide
And he did answer with a countenance
Chargd with no less amazement whence my view
Reverted to those lofty things which came
So slowly moving towards us that the bride
Would have outstript them on her bridal day

The lady called aloud Why thus yet burns
Affection in thee for these living lights
And dost not look on that which follows them

I straightway markd a tribe behind them walk
As if attendant on their leaders clothd
With raiment of such whiteness as on earth
Was never On my left the watry gleam
Borrowd and gave me back when there I lookd
As in a mirror my left side portrayd

When I had chosen on the rivers edge
Such station that the distance of the stream
Alone did separate me there I stayd
My steps for clearer prospect and beheld
The flames go onward leaving as they went
The air behind them painted as with trail
Of liveliest pencils so distinct were markd
All those sevn listed colours whence the sun
Maketh his bow and Cynthia her zone
These streaming gonfalons did flow beyond
My vision and ten paces as I guess
Parted the outermost Beneath a sky
So beautiful came foul andtwenty elders
By two and two with flowerdeluces crownd

All sang one song Blessed be thou among
The daughters of Adam and thy loveliness
Blessed for ever After that the flowers
And the fresh herblets on the opposite brink
Were free from that elected race as light
In heavn doth second light came after them
Four animals each crownd with verdurous leaf
With six wings each was plumd the plumage full
Of eyes and th eyes of Argus would be such
Were they endued with life Reader more rhymes
Will not waste in shadowing forth their form
For other need no straitens that in this
I may not give my bounty room But read
Ezekiel for he paints them from the north
How he beheld them come by Chebars flood
In whirlwind cloud and fire and even such
As thou shalt find them characterd by him
Here were they save as to the pennons there
From him departing John accords with me

The space surrounded by the four enclosd
A car triumphal on two wheels it came
Drawn at a Gryphons neck and he above
Stretchd either wing uplifted tween the midst
And the three listed hues on each side three
So that the wings did cleave or injure none
And out of sight they rose The members far
As he was bird were golden white the rest
With vermeil interveind So beautiful
A car in Rome neer gracd Augustus pomp
Or Africanus een the suns itself
Were poor to this that chariot of the sun
Erroneous which in blazing ruin fell
At Tellus prayr devout by the just doom
Mysterious of allseeing Jove Three nymphs
at the right wheel came circling in smooth dance
The one so ruddy that her form had scarce
Been known within a furnace of clear flame
The next did look as if the flesh and bones
Were emerald snow newfallen seemd the third

Now seemd the white to lead the ruddy now
And from her song who led the others took
Their treasure swift or slow At th other wheel
A band quaternion each in purple clad
Advancd with festal step as of them one
The rest conducted one upon whose front
Three eyes were seen In rear of all this group
Two old men I beheld dissimilar
In raiment but in port and gesture like
Solid and mainly grave of whom the one
Did show himself some favourd counsellor
Of the great Coan him whom nature made
To serve the costliest creature of her tribe
His fellow markd an opposite intent
Bearing a sword whose glitterance and keen edge
Een as I viewd it with the flood between
Appalld me Next four others I beheld
Of humble seeming and behind them all
One single old man sleeping as he came
With a shrewd visage And these seven each
Like the first troop were habited but wore
No braid of lilies on their temples wreathd
Rather with roses and each vermeil flower
A sight but little distant might have sworn
That they were all on fire above their brow

Whenas the car was oer against me straight
Was heard a thundring at whose voice it seemd
The chosen multitude were stayd for there
With the first ensigns made they solemn halt




CANTO XXX

Soon as the polar light which never knows
Setting nor rising nor the shadowy veil
Of other cloud than sin fair ornament
Of the first heavn to duty each one there
Safely convoying as that lower doth
The steersman to his port stood firmly fixd
Forthwith the saintly tribe who in the van
Between the Gryphon and its radiance came
Did turn them to the car as to their rest
And one as if commissiond from above
In holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud
Come spouse from Libanus and all the rest
Took up the songAt the last audit so
The blest shall rise from forth his cavern each
Uplifting lightly his newvested flesh
As on the sacred litter at the voice
Authoritative of that elder sprang
A hundred ministers and messengers
Of life eternal Blessed thou who comst
And O they cried from full hands scatter ye
Unwithring lilies and so saying cast
Flowers over head and round them on all sides

I have beheld ere now at break of day
The eastern clime all roseate and the sky
Opposd one deep and beautiful serene
And the suns face so shaded and with mists
Attemperd at lids rising that the eye
Long while endurd the sight thus in a cloud
Of flowers that from those hands angelic rose
And down within and outside of the car
Fell showering in white veil with olive wreathd
A virgin in my view appeard beneath
Green mantle robd in hue of living flame

And oer my Spirit that in former days
Within her presence had abode so long
No shuddring terror crept Mine eyes no more
Had knowledge of her yet there movd from her
A hidden virtue at whose touch awakd
The power of ancient love was strong within me

No sooner on my vision streaming smote
The heavnly influence which years past and een
In childhood thrilld me than towards Virgil I
Turnd me to leftward panting like a babe
That flees for refuge to his mothers breast
If aught have terrified or workd him woe
And would have cried There is no dram of blood
That doth not quiver in me The old flame
Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire
But Virgil had bereavd us of himself
Virgil my bestlovd father Virgil he
To whom I gave me up for safety nor
All our prime mother lost availd to save
My undewd cheeks from blur of soiling tears

Dante weep not that Virgil leaves thee nay
Weep thou not yet behooves thee feel the edge
Of other sword and thou shalt weep for that

As to the prow or stern some admiral
Paces the deck inspiriting his crew
When mid the sailyards all hands ply aloof
Thus on the left side of the car I saw
Turning me at the sound of mine own name
Which here I am compelld to register
The virgin stationd who before appeared
Veild in that festive shower angelical

Towards me across the stream she bent her eyes
Though from her brow the veil descending bound
With foliage of Minerva sufferd not
That I beheld her clearly then with act
Full royal still insulting oer her thrall
Added as one who speaking keepeth back
The bitterest saying to conclude the speech
Observe me well I am in sooth I am
Beatrice What and hast thou deignd at last
Approach the mountainnewest not O man
Thy happiness is whole Down fell mine eyes
On the clear fount but there myself espying
Recoild and sought the greensward such a weight
Of shame was on my forehead With a mien
Of that stern majesty which doth surround
mothers presence to her awestruck child
She lookd a flavour of such bitterness
Was mingled in her pity There her words
Brake off and suddenly the angels sang
In thee O gracious Lord my hope hath been
But went no farther than Thou Lord hast set
My feet in ample room As snow that lies
Amidst the living rafters on the back
Of Italy congeald when drifted high
And closely pild by rough Sclavonian blasts
Breathe but the land whereon no shadow falls
And straightway melting it distils away
Like a firewasted taper thus was I
Without a sigh or tear or ever these
Did sing that with the chiming of heavns sphere
Still in their warbling chime but when the strain
Of dulcet symphony expressd for me
Their soft compassion more than could the words
Virgin why so consumst him then the ice
Congeald about my bosom turnd itself
To spirit and water and with anguish forth
Gushd through the lips and eyelids from the heart

Upon the chariots right edge still she stood
Immovable and thus addressd her words
To those bright semblances with pity touchd
Ye in th eternal day your vigils keep
So that nor night nor slumber with close stealth
Conveys from you a single step in all
The goings on of life thence with more heed
I shape mine answer for his ear intended
Who there stands weeping that the sorrow now
May equal the transgression Not alone
Through operation of the mighty orbs
That mark each seed to some predestind aim
As with aspect or fortunate or ill
The constellations meet but through benign
Largess of heavnly graces which rain down
From such a height as mocks our vision this man
Was in the freshness of his being such
So gifted virtually that in him
All better habits wondrously had thrivd
The more of kindly strength is in the soil
So much doth evil seed and lack of culture
Mar it the more and make it run to wildness
These looks sometime upheld him for I showd
My youthful eyes and led him by their light
In upright walking Soon as I had reachd
The threshold of my second age and changd
My mortal for immortal then he left me
And gave himself to others When from flesh
To spirit I had risen and increase
Of beauty and of virtue circled me
I was less dear to him and valued less
His steps were turnd into deceitful ways
Following false images of good that make
No promise perfect Nor availd me aught
To sue for inspirations with the which
I both in dreams of night and otherwise
Did call him back of them so little reckd him
Such depth he fell that all device was short
Of his preserving save that he should view
The children of perdition To this end
I visited the purlieus of the dead
And one who hath conducted him thus high
Receivd my supplications urgd with weeping
It were a breaking of Gods high decree
If Lethe should be past and such food tasted
Without the cost of some repentant tear




CANTO XXXI

O Thou her words she thus without delay
Resuming turnd their point on me to whom
They but with lateral edge seemd harsh before
Say thou who standst beyond the holy stream
If this be true A charge so grievous needs
Thine own avowal On my faculty
Such strange amazement hung the voice expird
Imperfect ere its organs gave it birth

A little space refraining then she spake
What dost thou muse on Answer me The wave
On thy remembrances of evil yet
Hath done no injury A mingled sense
Of fear and of confusion from my lips
Did such a Yea produce as needed help
Of vision to interpret As when breaks
In act to be dischargd a crossbow bent
Beyond its pitch both nerve and bow oerstretchd
The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark
Thus tears and sighs forth gushing did I burst
Beneath the heavy load and thus my voice
Was slackend on its way She straight began
When my desire invited thee to love
The good which sets a bound to our aspirings
What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain
Did meet thee that thou so shouldst quit the hope
Of further progress or what bait of ease
Or promise of allurement led thee on
Elsewhere that thou elsewhere shouldst rather wait

A bitter sigh I drew then scarce found voice
To answer hardly to these sounds my lips
Gave utterance wailing Thy fair looks withdrawn
Things present with deceitful pleasures turnd
My steps aside She answering spake Hadst thou
Been silent or denied what thou avowst
Thou hadst not hid thy sin the more such eye
Observes it But wheneer the sinners cheek
Breaks forth into the preciousstreaming tears
Of selfaccusing in our court the wheel
Of justice doth run counter to the edge
Howeer that thou mayst profit by thy shame
For errors past and that henceforth more strength
May arm thee when thou hearst the Sirenvoice
Lay thou aside the motive to this grief
And lend attentive ear while I unfold
How opposite a way my buried flesh
Should have impelld thee Never didst thou spy
In art or nature aught so passing sweet
As were the limbs that in their beauteous frame
Enclosd me and are scatterd now in dust
If sweetest thing thus faild thee with my death
What afterward of mortal should thy wish
Have tempted When thou first hadst felt the dart
Of perishable things in my departing
For better realms thy wing thou shouldst have prund
To follow me and never stoopd again
To bide a second blow for a slight girl
Or other gaud as transient and as vain
The new and inexperiencd bird awaits
Twice it may be or thrice the fowlers aim
But in the sight of one whose plumes are full
In vain the net is spread the arrow wingd

I stood as children silent and ashamd
Stand listning with their eyes upon the earth
Acknowledging their fault and selfcondemnd
And she resumd If but to hear thus pains thee
Raise thou thy beard and lo what sight shall do

With less reluctance yields a sturdy holm
Rent from its fibers by a blast that blows
From off the pole or from Iarbas land
Than I at her behest my visage raisd
And thus the face denoting by the beard
I markd the secret sting her words conveyd

No sooner lifted I mine aspect up
Than downward sunk that vision I beheld
Of goodly creatures vanish and mine eyes
Yet unassurd and wavering bent their light
On Beatrice Towards the animal
Who joins two natures in one form she turnd
And even under shadow of her veil
And parted by the verdant rill that flowd
Between in loveliness appeard as much
Her former self surpassing as on earth
All others she surpassd Remorseful goads
Shot sudden through me Each thing else the more
Its love had late beguild me now the more
I Was loathsome On my heart so keenly smote
The bitter consciousness that on the ground
Oerpowerd I fell and what my state was then
She knows who was the cause When now my strength
Flowd back returning outward from the heart
The lady whom alone I first had seen
I found above me Loose me not she cried
Loose not thy hold and lo had draggd me high
As to my neck into the stream while she
Still as she drew me after swept along
Swift as a shuttle bounding oer the wave

The blessed shore approaching then was heard
So sweetly Tu asperges me that I
May not remember much less tell the sound
The beauteous dame her arms expanding claspd
My temples and immergd me where t was fit
The wave should drench me and thence raising up
Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs
Presented me so lavd and with their arm
They each did cover me Here are we nymphs
And in the heavn are stars Or ever earth
Was visited of Beatrice we
Appointed for her handmaids tended on her
We to her eyes will lead thee but the light
Of gladness that is in them well to scan
Those yonder three of deeper ken than ours
Thy sight shall quicken Thus began their song
And then they led me to the Gryphons breast
While turnd toward us Beatrice stood
Spare not thy vision We have stationed thee
Before the emeralds whence love erewhile
Hath drawn his weapons on thee As they spake
A thousand fervent wishes riveted
Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes that stood
Still fixd toward the Gryphon motionless
As the sun strikes a mirror even thus
Within those orbs the twofold being shone
For ever varying in one figure now
Reflected now in other Reader muse
How wondrous in my sight it seemd to mark
A thing albeit steadfast in itself
Yet in its imagd semblance mutable

Full of amaze and joyous while my soul
Fed on the viand whereof still desire
Grows with satiety the other three
With gesture that declard a loftier line
Advancd to their own carol on they came
Dancing in festive ring angelical

Turn Beatrice was their song O turn
Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one
Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace
Hath measurd Gracious at our prayr vouchsafe
Unveil to him thy cheeks that he may mark
Thy second beauty now conceald O splendour
O sacred light eternal who is he
So pale with musing in Pierian shades
Or with that fount so lavishly imbued
Whose spirit should not fail him in th essay
To represent thee such as thou didst seem
When under cope of the stillchiming heaven
Thou gavst to open air thy charms reveald




CANTO XXXII

Mine eyes with such an eager coveting
Were bent to rid them of their ten years thirst
No other sense was waking and een they
Were fencd on either side from heed of aught
So tangled in its customd toils that smile
Of saintly brightness drew me to itself
When forcibly toward the left my sight
The sacred virgins turnd for from their lips
I heard the warning sounds Too fixd a gaze

Awhile my vision labord as when late
Upon the oerstrained eyes the sun hath smote
But soon to lesser object as the view
Was now recoverd lesser in respect
To that excess of sensible whence late
I had perforce been sunderd on their right
I markd that glorious army wheel and turn
Against the sun and sevnfold lights their front
As when their bucklers for protection raisd
A wellrangd troop with portly banners curld
Wheel circling ere the whole can change their ground
Een thus the goodly regiment of heavn
Proceeding all did pass us ere the car
Had slopd his beam Attendant at the wheels
The damsels turnd and on the Gryphon movd
The sacred burden with a pace so smooth
No feather on him trembled The fair dame
Who through the wave had drawn me companied
By Statius and myself pursued the wheel
Whose orbit rolling markd a lesser arch

Through the high wood now void the more her blame
Who by the serpent was beguild I past
With step in cadence to the harmony
Angelic Onward had we movd as far
Perchance as arrow at three several flights
Full wingd had sped when from her station down
Descended Beatrice With one voice
All murmurd Adam circling next a plant
Despoild of flowers and leaf on every bough
Its tresses spreading more as more they rose
Were such as midst their forest wilds for height
The Indians might have gazd at Blessed thou
Gryphon whose beak hath never pluckd that tree
Pleasant to taste for hence the appetite
Was warpd to evil Round the stately trunk
Thus shouted forth the rest to whom returnd
The animal twicegenderd Yea for so
The generation of the just are savd
And turning to the chariotpole to foot
He drew it of the widowd branch and bound
There left unto the stock whereon it grew

As when large floods of radiance from above
Stream with that radiance mingled which ascends
Next after setting of the scaly sign
Our plants then burgeon and each wears anew
His wonted colours ere the sun have yokd
Beneath another star his flamy steeds
Thus putting forth a hue more faint than rose
And deeper than the violet was renewd
The plant erewhile in all its branches bare

Unearthly was the hymn which then arose
I understood it not nor to the end
Endurd the harmony Had I the skill
To pencil forth how closd th unpitying eyes
Slumbring when Syrinx warbled eyes that paid
So dearly for their watching then like painter
That with a model paints I might design
The manner of my falling into sleep
But feign who will the slumber cunningly
I pass it by to when I wakd and tell
How suddenly a flash of splendour rent
The curtain of my sleep and one cries out
Arise what dost thou As the chosen three
On Tabors mount admitted to behold
The blossoming of that fair tree whose fruit
Is coveted of angels and doth make
Perpetual feast in heaven to themselves
Returning at the word whence deeper sleeps
Were broken that they their tribe diminishd saw
Both Moses and Elias gone and changd
The stole their master wore thus to myself
Returning over me beheld I stand
The piteous one who cross the stream had brought
My steps And where all doubting I exclaimd
Is BeatriceSee her she replied
Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root
Behold th associate choir that circles her
The others with a melody more sweet
And more profound journeying to higher realms
Upon the Gryphon tend If there her words
Were closd I know not but mine eyes had now
Taen view of her by whom all other thoughts
Were barrd admittance On the very ground
Alone she sat as she had there been left
A guard upon the wain which I beheld
Bound to the twyform beast The seven nymphs
Did make themselves a cloister round about her
And in their hands upheld those lights secure
From blast septentrion and the gusty south

A little while thou shalt be forester here
And citizen shalt be forever with me
Of that true Rome wherein Christ dwells a Roman
To profit the misguided world keep now
Thine eyes upon the car and what thou seest
Take heed thou write returning to that place

Thus Beatrice at whose feet inclind
Devout at her behest my thought and eyes
I as she bade directed Never fire
With so swift motion forth a stormy cloud
Leapd downward from the welkins farthest bound
As I beheld the bird of Jove descending
Pounce on the tree and as he rushd the rind
Disparting crush beneath him buds much more
And leaflets On the car with all his might
He struck whence staggering like a ship it reeld
At random drivn to starboard now oercome
And now to larboard by the vaulting waves

Next springing up into the chariots womb
A fox I saw with hunger seeming pind
Of all good food But for his ugly sins
The saintly maid rebuking him away
Scampring he turnd fast as his hidebound corpse
Would bear him Next from whence before he came
I saw the eagle dart into the hull
O th car and leave it with his feathers lind
And then a voice like that which issues forth
From heart with sorrow rivd did issue forth
From heavn and O poor bark of mine it cried
How badly art thou freighted Then it seemd
That the earth opend between either wheel
And I beheld a dragon issue thence
That through the chariot fixd his forked train
And like a wasp that draggeth back the sting
So drawing forth his baleful train he draggd
Part of the bottom forth and went his way
Exulting What remaind as lively turf
With green herb so did clothe itself with plumes
Which haply had with purpose chaste and kind
Been offerd and therewith were clothd the wheels
Both one and other and the beam so quickly
A sigh were not breathd sooner Thus transformd
The holy structure through its several parts
Did put forth heads three on the beam and one
On every side the first like oxen hornd
But with a single horn upon their front
The four Like monster sight hath never seen
Oer it methought there sat secure as rock
On mountains lofty top a shameless whore
Whose ken rovd loosely round her At her side
As t were that none might bear her off I saw
A giant stand and ever and anon
They mingled kisses But her lustful eyes
Chancing on me to wander that fell minion
Scourgd her from head to foot all oer then full
Of jealousy and fierce with rage unloosd
The monster and draggd on so far across
The forest that from me its shades alone
Shielded the harlot and the newformd brute


CANTO XXXIII

The heathen Lord are come responsive thus
The trinal now and now the virgin band
Quaternion their sweet psalmody began
Weeping and Beatrice listend sad
And sighing to the song in such a mood
That Mary as she stood beside the cross
Was scarce more changd But when they gave her place
To speak then risen upright on her feet
She with a colour glowing bright as fire
Did answer Yet a little while and ye
Shall see me not and my beloved sisters
Again a little while and ye shall see me

Before her then she marshalld all the seven
And beckning only motiond me the dame
And that remaining sage to follow her

So on she passd and had not set I ween
Her tenth step to the ground when with mine eyes
Her eyes encounterd and with visage mild
So mend thy pace she cried that if my words
Address thee thou mayst still be aptly placd
To hear them Soon as duly to her side
I now had hastend Brother she began
Why makst thou no attempt at questioning
As thus we walk together Like to those
Who speaking with too reverent an awe
Before their betters draw not forth the voice
Alive unto their lips befell me shell
That I in sounds imperfect thus began
Lady what I have need of that thou knowst
And what will suit my need She answering thus
Of fearfulness and shame I will that thou
Henceforth do rid thee that thou speak no more
As one who dreams Thus far be taught of me
The vessel which thou sawst the serpent break
Was and is not let him who hath the blame
Hope not to scare Gods vengeance with a sop
Without an heir for ever shall not be
That eagle he who left the chariot plumd
Which monster made it first and next a prey
Plainly I view and therefore speak the stars
Een now approaching whose conjunction free
From all impediment and bar brings on
A season in the which one sent from God
Five hundred five and ten do mark him out
That foul one and th accomplice of her guilt
The giant both shall slay And if perchance
My saying dark as Themis or as Sphinx
Fail to persuade thee since like them it foils
The intellect with blindness yet ere long
Events shall be the Naiads that will solve
This knotty riddle and no damage light
On flock or field Take heed and as these words
By me are utterd teach them even so
To those who live that life which is a race
To death and when thou writst them keep in mind
Not to conceal how thou hast seen the plant
That twice hath now been spoild This whoso robs
This whoso plucks with blasphemy of deed
Sins against God who for his use alone
Creating hallowd it For taste of this
In pain and in desire five thousand years
And upward the first soul did yearn for him
Who punishd in himself the fatal gust

Thy reason slumbers if it deem this height
And summit thus inverted of the plant
Without due cause and were not vainer thoughts
As Elsas numbing waters to thy soul
And their fond pleasures had not dyed it dark
As Pyramus the mulberry thou hadst seen
In such momentous circumstance alone
Gods equal justice morally implied
In the forbidden tree But since I mark thee
In understanding hardend into stone
And to that hardness spotted too and staind
So that thine eye is dazzled at my word
I will that if not written yet at least
Painted thou take it in thee for the cause
That one brings home his staff inwreathd with palm

I thus As wax by seal that changeth not
Its impress now is stampd my brain by thee
But wherefore soars thy wishdfor speech so high
Beyond my sight that loses it the more
The more it strains to reach itTo the end
That thou mayst know she answerd straight the school
That thou hast followd and how far behind
When following my discourse its learning halts
And mayst behold your art from the divine
As distant as the disagreement is
Twixt earth and heavens most high and rapturous orb

I not remember I replied that eer
I was estrangd from thee nor for such fault
Doth conscience chide me Smiling she returnd
If thou canst not remember call to mind
How lately thou hast drunk of Lethes wave
And sure as smoke doth indicate a flame
In that forgetfulness itself conclude
Blame from thy alienated will incurrd
From henceforth verily my words shall be
As naked as will suit them to appear
In thy unpractisd view More sparkling now
And with retarded course the sun possessd
The circle of midday that varies still
As th aspect varies of each several clime
When as one sent in vaward of a troop
For escort pauses if perchance he spy
Vestige of somewhat strange and rare so pausd
The sevnfold band arriving at the verge
Of a dun umbrage hoar such as is seen
Beneath green leaves and gloomy branches oft
To overbrow a bleak and alpine cliff
And where they stood before them as it seemd
Tigris and Euphrates both beheld
Forth from one fountain issue and like friends
Linger at parting O enlightning beam
O glory of our kind beseech thee say
What water this which from one source derivd
Itself removes to distance from itself

To such entreaty answer thus was made
Entreat Matilda that she teach thee this

And here as one who clears himself of blame
Imputed the fair dame returnd Of me
He this and more hath learnt and I am safe
That Lethes water hath not hid it from him

And Beatrice Some more pressing care
That oft the memory reeves perchance hath made
His minds eye dark But lo where Eunoe cows
Lead thither and as thou art wont revive
His fainting virtue As a courteous spirit
That proffers no excuses but as soon
As he hath token of anothers will
Makes it his own when she had taen me thus
The lovely maiden movd her on and calld
To Statius with an air most ladylike
Come thou with him Were further space allowd
Then Reader might I sing though but in part
That beverage with whose sweetness I had neer
Been sated But since all the leaves are full
Appointed for this second strain mine art
With warning bridle checks me I returnd
From the most holy wave regenerate
If en as new plants renewd with foliage new
Pure and made apt for mounting to the stars
