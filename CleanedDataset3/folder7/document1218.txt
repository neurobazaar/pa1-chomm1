PART ONE THE MAN IN THE CASE



CHAPTER I

THE GRAY SEAL


Among New Yorks fashionable and ultraexclusive clubs the St James
stood an acknowledged leadermore men perhaps cast an envious eye at
its portals of modest and unassuming taste as they passed by on Fifth
Avenue than they did at any other club upon the long list that the city
boasts True there were more expensive clubs upon whose membership roll
scintillated more stars of New Yorks social set but the St James was
distinctive It guaranteed a man so to speakthat is it guaranteed a
man to be innately a gentleman It required money it is true to keep
up ones membership but there were many members who were not wealthy
as wealth is measured nowadaysthere were many even who were pressed
sometimes to meet their dues and their house accounts but the accounts
were invariably promptly paid No man once in could ever afford or
ever had the desire to resign from the St James Club Its membership
was cosmopolitan men of every walk in life passed in and out of
its doors professional men and business men physicians artists
merchants authors engineers each stamped with the hall mark of
the St James an innate gentleman To receive a two weeks outoftown
visitors card to the St James was something to speak about and men
from Chicago St Louis or San Francisco spoke of it with a sort of
holierthanthou air to fellow members of their own exclusive clubs at
home again

Is there any doubt that Jimmie Dale was a gentlemanan INNATE
gentleman Jimmie Dales father had been a member of the St James
Club and one of the largest safe manufacturers of the United States a
prosperous wealthy man and at Jimmie Dales birth he had proposed his
sons name for membership It took some time to get into the St James
there was a long waiting list that neither money influence nor pull
could alter by so much as one iota Men proposed their sons names for
membership when they were born as religiously as they entered them upon
the citys birth register At twentyone Jimmie Dale was elected to
membership and incidentally that same year graduated from Harvard
It was Mr Dales desire that his son should enter the business and
learn it from the ground up and Jimmie Dale for four years thereafter
had followed his fathers wishes Then his father died Jimmie Dale had
leanings toward more artistic pursuits than business He was credited
with sketching a little writing a little and he was credited with
having received a very snug amount from the combine to which he sold out
his safemanufacturing interests He lived a bachelor lifehis mother
had been dead many yearsin the house that his father had left him on
Riverside Drive kept a car or two and enough servants to run his
menage smoothly and serve a dinner exquisitely when he felt hospitably
inclined

Could there be any doubt that Jimmie Dale was innately a gentleman

It was evening and Jimmie Dale sat at a small table in the corner of
the St James Club dining room Opposite him sat Herman Carruthers
a young man of his own age about twentysix a leading figure in the
newspaper world whose rise from reporter to managing editor of the
morning NEWSARGUS within the short space of a few years had been almost
meteoric

They were at coffee and cigars and Jimmie Dale was leaning back in his
chair his dark eyes fixed interestedly on his guest

Carruthers intently engaged in trimming his cigar ash on the edge of
the Limoges china saucer of his coffee set looked up with an abrupt
laugh

No I wouldnt care to go on record as being an advocate of crime he
said whimsically that would never do But I dont mind admitting quite
privately that its been a positive regret to me that he has gone

Made too good copy to lose I suppose suggested Jimmie Dale
quizzically Too bad too after working up a theatrical name like that
for himthe Gray Sealrather unique Who stuck that on himyou

Carruthers laughedthen grown serious leaned toward Jimmie Dale

You dont mean to say Jimmie that you dont know about that do you
he asked incredulously Why up to a year ago the papers were full of
him

I never read your beastly agony columns said Jimmie Dale with a
cheery grin

Well said Carruthers you must have skipped everything but the stock
reports then

Granted said Jimmie Dale So go on Carruthers and tell me about
himI dare say I may have heard of him since you are so distressed
about it but my memory isnt good enough to contradict anything you may
have to say about the estimable gentleman so youre safe

Carruthers reverted to the Limoges saucer and the tip of his cigar

He was the most puzzling bewildering delightful crook in the annals
of crime said Carruthers reminiscently after a moments silence
Jimmie he was the kingpin of them all Clever isnt the word for him
or daredevil isnt either I used to think sometimes his motive was
more than half for the pure deviltry of it to laugh at the police and
pull the noses of the rest of us that were after him I used to dream
nights about those confounded gray seals of histhats where he got
his name he left every job he ever did with a little gray paper affair
fashioned diamondshaped stuck somewhere where it would be the first
thing your eyes would light upon when you reached the scene and

Dont go so fast smiled Jimmie Dale I dont quite get the
connection What did you have to do with thiserGray Seal fellow
Where do you come in

I I had a good deal to do with him said Carruthers grimly I was a
reporter when he first broke loose and the ambition of my life after
I began really to appreciate what he was was to get himand I nearly
did half a dozen times only

Only you never quite did eh cut in Jimmie Dale slyly How near did
you get old man Come on now no bluffing did the Gray Seal ever even
recognise you as a factor in the hareandhound game

Youre flicking on the raw Jimmie Carruthers answered with a wry
grimace He knew me all right confound him He favoured me with
several sarcastic notesIll show em to you some dayexplaining
how Id fallen down and how I could have got him if Id done something
else Carruthers fist came suddenly down on the table And I would
have got him too if he had lived

Lived ejaculated Jimmie Dale Hes dead then

Yes averted Carruthers hes dead

Hm said Jimmie Dale facetiously I hope the size of the wreath you
sent was an adequate tribute of your appreciation

I never sent any wreath returned Carruthers for the very simple
reason that I didnt know where to send it or when he died I said he
was dead because for over a year now he hasnt lifted a finger

Rotten poor evidence even for a newspaper commented Jimmie Dale
Why not give him credit for having sayreformed

Carruthers shook his head You dont get it at all Jimmie he said
earnestly The Gray Seal wasnt an ordinary crookhe was a classic
He was an artist and the art of the thing was in his blood A man like
that could no more stop than he could stop breathingand live Hes
dead theres nothing to it but thathes dead Id bet a years salary
on it

Another good man gone wrong then said Jimmie Dale capriciously I
suppose though that at least you discovered the woman in the case

Carruthers looked up quickly a little startled then laughed shortly

Whats the matter inquired Jimmie Dale

Nothing said Carruthers You kind of got me for a moment thats
all Thats the way those infernal notes from the Gray Seal used to
end up Find the lady old chap and youll get me He had a damned
patronising familiarity that would make you squirm

Poor old Carruthers grinned Jimmie Dale You did take it to heart
didnt you

Id have sold my soul to get himand so would you if you had been in
my boots said Carruthers biting nervously at the end of his cigar

And been sorry for it afterward supplied Jimmie Dale

Yes by Jove youre right admitted Carruthers I suppose I should
I actually got to love the fellowit was the GAME really that I
wanted to beat

Well and how about this woman Keep on the straight and narrow path
old man prodded Jimmie Dale

The woman Carruthers smiled Nothing doing I dont believe there
was onehe wouldnt have been likely to egg the police and reporters on
to finding her if there had been would he It was a blind of course
He worked alone absolutely alone Thats the secret of his success
according to my way of thinking There was never so much as an
indication that he had had an accomplice in anything he ever did

Jimmie Dales eyes travelled around the clubs homelike perfectly
appointed room He nodded to a fellow member here and there then his
eyes rested musingly on his guest again

Carruthers was staring thoughtfully at his coffee cup

He was the prince of crooks and the father of originality announced
Carruthers abruptly following the pause that had ensued Half the time
there wasnt any more getting at the motive for the curious things he
did than there was getting at the Gray Seal himself

Carruthers said Jimmy Dale with a quick little nod of approval
youre positively interesting tonight But so far youve been kind
of scouting around the outside edges without getting into the thick of
it Lets have some of your experiences with the Gray Seal in detail
they ought to make ripping fine yarns

Not tonight Jimmie said Carruthers it would take too long He
pulled out his watch mechanically as he spoke glanced at itand pushed
back his chair Great Scott he exclaimed Its nearly halfpast
nine Id no idea we had lingered so long over dinner Ill have to
hurry were a morning paper you know Jimmie

What Really Is it as late as that Jimmie Dale rose from his chair
as Carruthers stood up Well if you must

I must said Carruthers with a laugh

All right O slave Jimmie Dale laughed backand slipped his hand
a trick of their old college days together through Carruthers arm as
they left the room

He accompanied Carruthers downstairs to the door of the club and saw
his guest into a taxi then he returned inside sauntered through the
billiard room and from there into one of the cardrooms where pressed
into a game he played several rubbers of bridge before going home

It was therefore well on toward midnight when Jimmie Dale arrived at
his house on Riverside Drive and was admitted by an elderly manservant

Hello Jason said Jimmie Dale pleasantly You still up

Yes sir replied Jason who had been valet to Jimmie Dales father
before him I was going to bed sir at about ten oclock when a
messenger came with a letter Begging your pardon sir a young lady
and

JasonJimmie Dale flung out the interruption sudden quick
imperativewhat did she look like

Whywhy I dont exactly know as I could describe her sir stammered
Jason taken aback Very ladylike sir in her dress and appearance
and what I would call sir a beautiful face

Hair and eyeswhat color demanded Jimmie Dale crisply Nose lips
chinwhat shape

Why sir gasped Jason staring at his master II dont rightly
know I wouldnt call her fair or dark something between I didnt take
particular notice and it wasnt overlight outside the door

Its too bad you werent a younger man Jason commented Jimmie Dale
with a curious tinge of bitterness in his voice Id have given a
years income for your opportunity tonight Jason

Yes sir said Jason helplessly

Well go on prompted Jimmie Dale You told her I wasnt home and
she said she knew it didnt she And she left the letter that I was on
no account to miss receiving when I got back though there was no need
of telephoning me to the clubwhen I returned would do but it was
imperative that I should have it theneh

Good Lord sir ejaculated Jason his jaw dropped thats exactly what
she did say

Jason said Jimmie Dale grimly listen to me If ever she comes here
again inveigle her in If you cant inveigle her use force capture
her pull her in do anythingdo anything do you hear Only dont let
her get away from you until Ive come

Jason gazed at his master as though the other had lost his reason

Use force sir he repeated weaklyand shook his head Youyou
cant mean that sir

Cant I inquired Jimmie Dale with a mirthless smile I mean every
word of it Jasonand if I thought there was the slightest chance of
her giving you the opportunity Id be more imperative still As it
iswheres the letter

On the table in your studio sir said Jason mechanically

Jimmie Dale started toward the stairsthen turned and came back to
where Jason still shaking his head heavily had been gazing anxiously
after his master Jimmie Dale laid his hand on the old mans shoulder

Jason he said kindly with a swift change of mood youve been a
long time in the familyfirst with father and now with me Youd do a
good deal for me wouldnt you

Id do anything in the world for you Master Jim said the old man
earnestly

Well then remember this said Jimmie Dale slowly looking into the
others eyes remember thiskeep your mouth shut and your eyes open
Its my fault I should have warned you long ago but I never dreamed
that she would ever come here herself There have been times when it was
practically a matter of life and death to me to know who that woman is
that you saw tonight Thats all Jason Now go to bed

Master Jim said the old man simply thank you sir thank you for
trusting me Ive dandled you on my knee when you were a baby Master
Jim I dont know what its about and it isnt for me to ask I
thought sir that maybe you were having a little fun with me But I
know now and you can trust me Master Jim if she ever comes again

Thank you Jason said Jimmie Dale his hand closing with an
appreciative pressure on the others shoulder Goodnight Jason

Upstairs on the first landing Jimmie Dale opened a door closed and
locked it behind himand the electric switch clicked under his fingers
A glow fell softly from a cluster of shaded ceiling lights It was a
large room a very large room running the entire depth of the
house and the effect of apparent disorder in the arrangement of its
appointments seemed to breathe a sense of charm There were great
cozy deep leathercovered lounging chairs a huge leathercovered
davenport and an easel or two with halffinished sketches upon them
the walls were panelled the panels of exquisite grain and matching in
the centre of the room stood a flattopped rosewood desk upon the floor
was a dark heavy velvet rug and perhaps most inviting of all there
was a great oldfashioned fireplace at one side of the room

For an instant Jimmie Dale remained quietly by the door as though
listening Six feet he stood muscular in every line of his body like
a welltrained athlete with no single ounce of superfluous fat about
himthe grace and ease of power in his poise His strong cleanshaven
face as the light fell upon it now was seriousa mood that became him
wellthe firm lips closed the dark reliant eyes a little narrowed a
frown on the broad forehead the square jaw clamped

Then abruptly he walked across the room to the desk picked up an
envelope that lay upon it and turning again dropped into the nearest
lounging chair

There had been no doubt in his mind none to dispel It was precisely
what he had expected from almost the first word Jason had spoken It was
the same handwriting the same texture of paper and there was the same
old haunting rare indefinable fragrance about it Jimmie Dales
hands turned the envelope now this way now that as he looked at it
Wonderful hands were Jimmie Dales with long slim tapering fingers
whose sensitive tips seemed now as though they were striving to decipher
the message within

He laughed suddenly a little harshly and tore open the envelope
Five closely written sheets fell into his hand He read them slowly
critically read them over again and then his eyes on the rug at his
feet he began to tear the paper into minute pieces between his fingers
depositing the pieces as he tore them upon the arm of his chair The
five sheets demolished his fingers dipped into the heap of shreds on
the arm of the chair and tore them over and over again tore them until
they were scarcely larger than bits of confetti tore at them absently
and mechanically his eyes never shifting from the rug at his feet

Then with a shrug of his shoulders as though rousing himself to present
reality a curious smile flickering on his lips he brushed the pieces
of paper into one hand carried them to the empty fireplace laid them
down in a little pile and set them afire Lighting a cigarette he
watched them burn until the last glow had gone from the last charred
scrap then he crunched and scattered them with the brasshandled fender
brush and retracing his steps across the room flung back a portiere
from where it hung before a little alcove and dropped on his knees in
front of a round squat barrelshaped safeone of his own design and
planning in the years when he had been with his father

His slim sensitive fingers played for an instant among the knobs and
dials that studded the door guided it seemed by the sense of touch
aloneand the door swung open Within was another door with locks and
bolts as intricate and massive as the outer one This too he opened
and then from the interior took out a short thick rolledup leather
bundle tied together with thongs He rose from his knees closed the
safe and drew the portiere across the alcove again With the bundle
under his arm he glanced sharply around the room listened intently
then unlocking the door that gave on the hall he switched off the
lights and went to his dressing room that was on the same floor Here
divesting himself quickly of his dinner clothes he selected a dark
tweed suit with loosefitting sack coat from his wardrobe and began to
put it on

Dressed all but his coat and vest he turned to the leather bundle that
he had placed on a table untied the thongs and carefully opened it
out to its full lengthand again that curious cryptic smile tinged his
lips Rolled the opposite away from that in which it had been tied
up the leather strip made a wide belt that went on somewhat after
the fashion of a life preserver the thongs being used for shoulder
strapsa belt that once on the vest would hide completely and
fitting close left no telltale bulge in the outer garments It was not
an ordinary belt it was full of stoutsewn upright little pockets
all the way around and in the pockets grimly lay an array of fine
bluedsteel highly tempered instrumentsa compact powerful burglars
kit

The slim sensitive fingers passed with almost a caressing touch over
the vicious little implements and from one of the pockets extracted
a thin flat metal case This Jimmie Dale opened and glanced
insidebetween sheets of oil paper lay little rows of GRAY ADHESIVE
DIAMONDSHAPED SEALS

Jimmie Dale snapped the case shut returned it to its recess and from
another took out a black silk mask He held it up to the light for
examination

Pretty good shape after a year muttered Jimmie Dale replacing it

He put on the belt then his vest and coat From the drawer of his
dresser he took an automatic revolver and an electric flashlight
slipped them into his pocket and went softly downstairs From the hat
stand he chose a black slouch hat pulled it well over his eyesand
left the house

Jimmie Dale walked down a block then hailed a bus and mounted to the
top It was late and he found himself the only passenger He inserted
his dime in the conductors little resonantbelled cash receiver and
then settled back on the uncomfortable bumping cushionless seat

On rattled the bus it turned across town passed the Circle and
headed for Fifth Avenuebut Jimmie Dale to all appearances was quite
oblivious of its movements

It was a year since she had written him SHE Jimmie Dale did not smile
his lips were pressed hard together Not a very intimate or personal
appellation thatbut he knew her by no other It WAS a woman
surelythe handwriting was feminine the diction eminently soand had
SHE not come herself that night to Jason He remembered the last letter
apart from the one tonight that he had received from her It was
a year ago nowand the letter had been hardly more than a note The
police had worked themselves into a frenzy over the Gray Seal the
papers had grown absolutely maudlinand she had written in her
characteristic way


Things are a little too warm arent they Jimmie Lets let them cool
for a year


Since then until tonight he had heard nothing from her It was a
strange compact that he had entered intoso strange that it could never
have known could never know a parallelunique dangerous bizarre it
was all that and more It had begun really through his connection with
his fathers businessthe business of manufacturing safes that should
defy the cleverest criminalswhen his brains turned into that channel
had been pitted against the underworld against the methods of a
thousand different crooks from Maine to California the report of whose
every operation had reached him in the natural course of business
and every one of which he had studied in minutest detail It had begun
through thatbut at the bottom of it was his own restless adventurous
spirit

He had meant to set the police by the ears using his grayseal device
both as an added barb and that no innocent bystander of the underworld
innocent for once might be involvedhe had meant to laugh at them and
puzzle them to the verge of madness for in the last analysis they would
find only an abortive attempt at crimeand he had succeeded And then
he had gone too farand he had been caughtby HER That string of
pearls which to study whose effect facetiously he had so idiotically
wrapped around his wrist and which so ironically he had been unable
to loosen in time and had been forced to carry with him in his sudden
desperate dash to escape from Marxs the big jewelers in Maiden Lane
whose strong room he had toyed with one night had been the lever which
AT FIRST she had held over him

The bus was on Fifth Avenue now and speeding rapidly down the deserted
thoroughfare Jimmie Dale looked up at the lighted windows of the St
James Club as they went by smiled whimsically and shifted in his seat
seeking a more comfortable position

She had caught himhow he did not knowhe had never seen herdid not
know who she was though time and again he had devoted all his energies
for months at a stretch to a solution of the mystery The morning
following the Maiden Lane affair indeed before he had breakfasted
Jason had brought him the first letter from her It had started by
detailing his every move of the night beforeand it had ended with an
ultimatum The cleverness the originality of the Gray Seal as a crook
lacked but one thing she had naively written and that one thing was
that his crookedness required a leading string to guide it into channels
that were worthy of his genius In a word SHE would plan the coups
and he would act at her dictation and execute themor else how did
twenty years in Sing Sing for that little Maiden Lane affair appeal to
him He was to answer by the next morning a simple yes or no in the
personal column of the morning NEWSARGUS

A threat to a man like Jimmie Dale was like flaunting a red rag at a
bull and a rage ungovernable had surged upon him Then cold reason had
come He was caughtthere was no question about thatshe had taken
pains to show him that he need make no mistake there Innocent enough in
his own conscience as far as actual theft went for the pearls would in
due course be restored in some way to the possession of their owner he
would have been unable to make even his own father who was alive then
believe in his innocence let alone a jury of his peers Dishonour
shame ignominy a long prison sentence stared him in the face
and there was but one alternativeto link hands with this unseen
mysterious accomplice Well he could at least temporise he could
always queer a game in some specious manner if he were pushed too
far And so in the next mornings NEWSARGUS Jimmie Dale had answered
yes And then had followed those years in which there had been NO
temporising in which every plan was carried out to the last detail
those years of curious unaccountable bewildering affairs that
Carruthers had spoken of one on top of another that had shaken the old
headquarters on Mulberry Street to its foundations until the Gray Seal
had become a name to conjure with And yes it was quite true he
had entered into it all gone the limit with an eagerness that was
insatiable

The bus had reached the lower end of Fifth Avenue passed through
Washington Square and stopped at the end of its run Jimmie Dale
clambered down from the top threw a pleasant goodnight to the
conductor and headed briskly down the street before him A little
later he crossed into West Broadway and his pace slowed to a leisurely
stroll

Here at the upper end of the street was a conglomerate business
section of rather inferior class catering doubtless to the poor
foreign element that congregated west of Broadway proper and to the
south of Washington Square The street was at first glance deserted
it was dark and dreary with stores and lofts on either side An
elevated train roared by overhead with a thunderous deafening clamour
Jimmie Dale on the righthand side of the street glanced interestedly
at the dark store windows as he went by And then a block ahead on the
other side his eyes rested on an approaching form As the other reached
the corner and paused and the light from the street lamp glinted on
brass buttons Jimmie Dales eyes narrowed a little under his slouch
hat The policeman although nonchalantly swinging a nightstick
appeared to be watching him

Jimmie Dale went on half a block farther stooped to the sidewalk to
tie his shoe glanced back over his shoulderthe policeman was not in
sightand slipped like a shadow into the alleyway beside which he had
stopped

It was another Jimmie Dale nowthe professional Jimmie Dale Quick as
a cat active lithe he was over a six foot fence in the rear of a
building in a flash and crouched a black shape against the back door
of an unpretentious unkempt dirty secondhand shop that fronted
on West Broadwaythe last place certainly in all New York that the
managing editor of the NEWSARGUS or any one else for that matter
would have picked out as the setting for the second debut of the Gray
Seal

From the belt around his waist Jimmie Dale took the black silk mask
and slipped it on and from the belt too came a little instrument
that his deft fingers manipulated in the lock A curious snipping sound
followed Jimmie Dale put his weight gradually against the door The
door held fast

Bolted said Jimmie Dale to himself

The sensitive fingers travelled slowly up and down the side of the door
seeming to press and feel for the position of the bolt through an inch
of plankthen from the belt came a tiny saw thin and pointed at the
end that fitted into the little handle drawn from another receptacle in
the leather girdle beneath the unbuttoned vest

Hardly a sound it made as it bit into the door Half a minute
passedthere was the faint fall of a small piece of woodinto the
aperture crept the delicate tapering fingerscame a slight rasping of
metalthen the door swung back the dark shadow that had been Jimmie
Dale vanished and the door closed again

A round white beam of light glowed for an instantand disappeared A
miscellaneous lumbering collection of junk and odds and ends
blocked the entry leaving no more space than was sufficient for bare
passageway Jimmie Dale moved cautiouslyand once more the flashlight
in his hand showed the way for an instantthen darkness again

The cluttered accumulation of secondhand stuff in the rear gave place to
a little more orderly arrangement as he advanced toward the front of the
store Like a huge firefly the flashlight twinkled went out twinkled
again and went out He passed a sort of crude partitionedoff
apartment that did duty for the establishments office a sort of little
boxedin place it was about in the middle of the floor Jimmie Dales
light played on it for a moment but he kept on toward the front door
without any pause

Every movement was quick sure accurate with not a wasted second It
had been barely a minute since he had vaulted the back fence It was
hardly a quarter of a minute more before the cumbersome lock of the
front door was unfastened and the door itself pulled imperceptibly
ajar

He went swiftly back to the office nowand found it even more of a
shaky cheap affair than it had at first appeared more like a box stall
with windows around the top than anything else the windows doubtless to
permit the occupant to overlook the store from the vantage point of the
high stool that stood before a long battered wobbly desk There was
a door to the place too but the door was open and the key was in
the lock The ray of Jimmie Dales flashlight swept once around the
interiorand rested on an antique ponderous safe

Under the mask Jimmie Dales lips parted in a smile that seemed almost
apologetic as he viewed the helpless iron monstrosity that was little
more than an insult to a trained cracksman Then from the belt came the
thin metal case and a pair of tweezers He opened the case and with
the tweezers lifted out one of the graycoloured diamondshaped seals
Holding the seal with the tweezers he moistened the gummed side with
his lips then laid it on a handkerchief which he took from his pocket
and clapped the handkerchief against the front of the safe sticking
the seal conspicuously into place Jimmie Dales insignia bore no finger
prints The microscopes and magnifying glasses at headquarters had many
a time regretfully assured the police of that fact

And now his hands and fingers seemed to work like lightning Into the
soft iron bit a drillbit in and throughbit in and through again
It was dark pitch blackand silent Not a sound save the quick dull
rasp of the ratchetlike the distant gnawing of a mouse Jimmie Dale
worked fastanother hole went through the face of the oldfashioned
safeand then suddenly he straightened up to listen every faculty
tense alert and strained his body thrown a little forward WHAT WAS
THAT

From the alleyway leading from the street without through which he
himself had come sounded the stealthy crunch of feet Motionless in the
utter darkness Jimmie Dale listenedthere was a scraping noise in the
rearsomeone was climbing the fence that he had climbed

In an instant the tools in Jimmie Dales hands disappeared into their
respective pockets beneath his vestand the sensitive fingers shot to
the dial on the safe

Too bad muttered Jimmie Dale plaintively to himself I could have
made such an artistic job of itI swear I could have cut Carruthers
profile in the hole in less than no timeto open it like this is really
taking the poor old thing at a disadvantage

He was on his knees now one ear close to the dial listening as the
tumblers fell while the delicate fingers spun the knob unerringlythe
other ear strained toward the rear of the premises

Came a footstepa ray of lighta stumblenearerthe newcomer was
inside the place now and must have found out that the back door had
been tampered with Nearer came the stepsstill nearerand then the
safe door swung open under Jimmie Dales hand and Jimmie Dale that he
might not be caught like a rat in a trap darted from the officebut he
had delayed a little too long

From around the cluttered piles of junk and miscellany swept the
lightfull on Jimmie Dale Hesitation for the smallest fraction of a
second would have been fatal but hesitation was something that in all
his life Jimmie Dale had never known Quick as a panther in its spring
he leaped full at the light and the man behind it The rough voice in
surprised exclamation at the sudden discovery of the quarry died in a
gasp

There was a crash as the two men metand the other reeled back before
the impact Onto him Jimmie Dale sprang and his hands flew for the
others throat It was an officer in uniform Jimmie Dale had felt the
brass buttons as they locked In the darkness there was a queer smile on
Jimmie Dales tight lips It was no doubt THE officer whom he had passed
on the other side of the street

The other was a smaller man than Jimmie Dale but powerful for his
buildand he fought now with all his strength This way and that the
two men reeled staggered swayed panting and gasping and thenthey
had lurched back close to the office doorwith a sudden swing every
muscle brought into play for a supreme effort Jimmie Dale hurled the
other from him sending the man sprawling back to the floor of the
office and in the winking of an eye had slammed shut the door and
turned the key

There was a bulllike roar the shrill CHEEPCHEEPCHEEP of the
patrolmans whistle and a shattering crash as the officer flung his
body against the partitionthen the bark of a revolver shot the tinkle
of breaking glass as the man fired through the office windowand past
Jimmie Dale speeding now for the front door a bullet hummed viciously

Out on the street dashed Jimmie Dale whipping the mask from his
faceand glanced like a hawk around him For all the racket the
neighbourhood had not yet been arousedno one was in sight From just
overhead came the rattle of a downtown elevated train In a hundredyard
sprint Jimmie Dale raced it a half block to the station tore up the
stepsand a moment later dropped nonchalantly into a seat and pulled an
evening newspaper from his pocket

Jimmie Dale got off at the second station down crossed the street
mounted the steps of the elevated again and took the next train uptown
His movements appeared to be somewhat erratiche alighted at the
station next above the one by which he had made his escape Looking down
the street it was too dark to see much of anything but a confused noise
as of a gathering crowd reached him from what was about the location of
the secondhand store He listened appreciatively for a moment

Isnt it a perfectly lovely night said Jimmie Dale amiably to
himself And to think of that cop running away with the idea that I
didnt see him when he hid in a doorway after I passed the corner Well
well strangeisnt it

With another glance down the street a whimsical lift of his shoulders
he headed west into the dilapidated tenement quarter that huddled for
a handful of blocks near by just south of Washington Square It was
a little after one oclock in the morning now and the pedestrians were
casual Jimmie Dale read the street signs on the corners as he went
along turned abruptly into an intersecting street counted the
tenements from the corner as he passed andfor the eye of any one who
might be watchingopened the street door of one of them quite as though
he were accustomed and had a perfect right to do so and went inside

It was murky and dark within hot unhealthy with lingering smells of
garlic and stale cooking He groped for the stairs and started up
He climbed one flight then anotherand one more to the top Here
treading softly he made an examination of the landing with a view
evidently to obtaining an idea of the location and the number of doors
that opened off from it

His selection fell on the third door from the head of the stairsthere
were four all told two apartments of two rooms each He paused for an
instant to adjust the black silk mask tried the door quietly found it
unlocked opened it with a sudden quick brisk movementand stepping
in side leaned with his back against it

Goodmorning said Jimmie Dale pleasantly

It was a squalid place a miserable hole in which a single flickering
yellow gas jet gave light It was almost bare of furniture there was
nothing but a couple of cheap chairs a rickety tableunpawnable A
boy he was hardly more than that perhaps twentytwo from a posture
in which he was huddled across the table with head buried in outflung
arms sprang with a startled cry to his feet

Goodmorning said Jimmie Dale again Your names Hagan Bert
Haganisnt it And you work for Isaac Brolsky in the secondhand shop
over on West Broadwaydont you

The boys lips quivered and the gaunt hollow halfstarved face
white ashenwhite now was pitiful

II guess you got me he faltered II suppose youre a
plainclothes man though I never knew dicks wore masks

They dont generally said Jimmie Dale coolly Its a fad of
mineBert Hagan

The lad hanging to the table turned his head away for a momentand
there was silence

Presently Hagan spoke again Ill go he said numbly I wont make any
trouble Wouldwould you mind not speaking loud II wouldnt like her
to know

Her said Jimmie Dale softly

The boy tiptoed across the room opened a connecting door a little
peered inside opened it a little widerand looked over his shoulder at
Jimmie Dale

Jimmie Dale crossed to the boy looked inside the other roomand his
lip twitched queerly as the sight sent a quick hurt throb through his
heart A young woman younger than the boy lay on a tumbledown bed a
rag of clothing over herher face with a deathlike pallor upon it as
she lay in what appeared to be a stupor She was ill critically ill
it needed no trained eye to discern a fact all too apparent to the most
casual observer The squalor the glaring poverty here was even more
pitifully in evidence than in the other roomonly here upon a chair
beside the bed was a cluster of medicine bottles and a little heap of
fruit

Jimmie Dale drew back silently as the boy closed the door

Hagan walked to the table and picked up his hat

ImIm ready he said brokenly Lets go

Just a minute said Jimmie Dale Tell us about it

Twont take long said Hagan trying to smile Shes my wife The
sickness took all we had II kinder got behind in the rent and things
They were going to fire us out of heretomorrow And there wasnt any
money for the medicine andand the things she had to have Maybe you
wouldnt have done itbut I did I couldnt see her dying there for the
want of something a little moneyd buyandand I couldnthe caught
his voice in a little sobI couldnt see her thrown out on the street
like that

And so said Jimmie Dale instead of putting old Isaacs cash in
the safe this evening when you locked up you put it in your pocket
insteadeh Didnt you know youd get caught

What did it matter said the boy He was twirling his misshappen hat
between his fingers I knew theyd know it was me in the morning when
old Isaac found it gone because there wasnt anybody else to do it
But I paid the rent for four months ahead tonight and I fixed it sos
shed have medicine and things to eat I was going to beat it before
daylight myselfIhe brushed his hand hurriedly across his cheekI
didnt want to goto leave her till I had to

Well saythere was wonderment in Jimmie Dales tones and his
English lapsed into ungrammatical reassuring vernacularaint that
queer Say Im no detective Gee kid did you think I was Say listen
to this I cracked old Isaacs safe half an hour agoand I guess there
wont be any idea going around that you got the money and I pulled a
lemon Say I aint superstitious but it looks like luck meant you to
have another chance dont it

The hat dropped from Hagans hands to the floor and he swayed a little

Youyou aint a dick he stammered Then howd you know about me and
my name when you found the safe empty Who told you

A wry grimace spread suddenly over Jimmie Dales face beneath the mask
and he swallowed hard Jimmie Dale would have given a good deal to have
been able to answer that question himself

Oh that said Jimmie Dale Thats easyI knew you worked there
Say its the limit aint it Talk about your luck being in why all
youve got to do is to sit tight and keep your mouth shut and youre
safe as a church Only say what are you going to do about the money
now youve got a four months start and are kind of landed on your feet

Do said the boy Ill pay it back little by little I meant to I
aint no He stopped abruptly

Crook supplied Jimmie Dale pleasantly Spit it right out kid you
wont hurt my feelings none Well Ill tell youyoure talking the way
I like to hear youyou pay that back slide it in without his knowing
it a bit at a time whenever you can and youll never hear a yip out
of me but if you dont why it kind of looks as though I have a right
to come down your street and get my share or know the reason whyeh

Then you never get any share said Hagan with a catch in his voice
I pay it back as fast as I can

Sure said Jimmie Dale Thats rightthats what I said Well so
longHagan And Jimmie Dale had opened the door and slipped outside

An hour later in his dressing room in his house on Riverside Drive
Jimmie Dale was removing his coat as the telephone a hand instrument on
the table rang Jimmie Dale glanced at itand leisurely proceeded
to remove his vest Again the telephone rang Jimmie Dale took off his
curious pocketed leather beltas the telephone repeated its summons
He picked out the little drill he had used a short while before and
inspected it criticallyfeeling its point with his thumb as one might
feel a razors blade Again the telephone rang insistently He reached
languidly for the receiver took it off its hook and held it to his
ear

Hello said Jimmie Dale with a sleepy yawn Hello Hello Why the
deuce dont you yank a man out of bed at two oclock in the morning and
have done with it andeh Oh that you Carruthers

Yes came Carruthers voice excitedly Jimmie listenlisten The
Gray Seals come to life Hes just pulled a break on West Broadway

Good Lord gasped Jimmie Dale You dont say



CHAPTER II

BY PROXY


The most puzzling bewildering delightful crook in the annals of crime
Herman Carruthers the editor of the MORNING NEWSARGUS had called the
Gray Seal and Jimmie Dale smiled a little grimly now as he recalled
the occasion of a week ago at the St James Club over their afterdinner
coffee That was before his second debut with Isaac Brolskys
povertystricken premises over on West Broadway as a setting for the
break

SHE had written Things are a little too warm arent they Jimmie
Lets let them cool for a year Well they had cooled for a year and
Carruthers as a result had been complacently satisfied in his own mind
that the Gray Seal was deaduntil that break at Isaac Brolskys over on
West Broadway

Jimmie Dales smile was tinged with whimsicality now The only effect
of the years inaction had been to usher in his renewed activity with
a furor compared to which all that had gone before was insignificant
Where the newspapers had been maudlin they now ravedraved in
editorials and raved in headlines It was an impossible untenable
unbelievable condition of affairs that this Gray Seal for all his
incomparable cleverness should flaunt his crimes in the faces of the
citizens of New York One could actually see the editors writhing in
their swivel chairs as their fiery denunciations dripped from their
pens What was the matter with the police Were the police children
or worse still imbecilesor still worse again was there some one
higher up who was profiting by this rogues work New York would not
stand for itNew York would most decidedly notand the sooner the
police realised that fact the better If the police were helpless or
tools the citizens of New York were not and it was time the citizens
were thoroughly aroused

There was a way too to arouse the citizens that was both good
business from the newspaper standpoint and efficacious as a method
Carruthers of the MORNING NEWSARGUS had initiated it The MORNING
NEWSARGUS offered twentyfive thousand dollars reward for the capture
of the Gray Seal Other papers immediately followed suit in varying
amounts The authorities State and municipal goaded to desperation
did likewise and the five million men women and children of New York
were automatically metamorphosed into embryonic sleuths New York was
aroused

Jimmie Dale alias the Gray Seal member of the ultraexclusive St
James Club the latter fact sufficient in itself to guarantee his
social standing graduate of Harvard inheritor of his deceased fathers
immense wealth amassed in the manufacture of burglarproof safes some
of the most ingenious patents on which were due to Jimmie Dale himself
figured with a pencil on the margin of the newspaper he had been
reading using the arm of the big luxurious leatherupholstered
lounging chair as a support for the paper The result of his
calculations was eightyfive thousand dollars

He brushed the paper onto the Turkish rug dove into the pocket of his
dinner jacket for his cigarettes and began to smoke as his eyes strayed
around the room his own particular den in his fashionable Riverside
Drive residence

Eightyfive thousand dollars reward Jimmie Dale blew meditative rings
of cigarette smoke at the fireplace What would she say to that Would
she decide it was too hot again and call it off It added quite a
little hazard to the gameQUITE a little If he only knew who she
was It was a strange partnershipthe strangest partnership that had
ever existed between two human beings

He turned a little in his chair as a step sounded in the hallway
withoutthat is Jimmie Dale caught the sound muffled though it was by
the heavy carpet Came then a knock upon the door

Come in invited Jimmie Dale

It was old Jason the butler The old man was visibly excited as he
extended a silver tray on which lay a letter

Jimmie Dales hand reached quickly out the long slim tapering fingers
closed upon the envelopebut his eyes were on Jason significantly
questioningly

Yes Master Jim said the old man I recognised it on the instant
sir After what you said sir last week honouring me I might say to
a certain extent with your confidence though Im sure I dont know what
it all means I

Who brought it this time Jason inquired Jimmie Dale quietly

Not the young person begging your pardon not the young lady sir A
shuffer in a big automobile Your master at once he says and shoves
the letter into my hand and was off

Very good Jason said Jimmie Dale You may go

The door closed Yes it was from HERit was the same texture of paper
there was the same rare haunting fragrance clinging to it

He tore the envelope open and extracted a folded sheet of paper What
was it this time To call the partnership off again until the present
furor should have subsided once moreor the skilfully sketched outline
of a new adventure Which He glanced at the few lines written on the
sheet and lunged forward from his chair to his feet It was neither one
nor the other It was

Jimmie Dales face was set and an angry red surge swept his cheeks His
lips moved muttering audibly fragments of the letter as he stared at
it

incredible that youa heinous thingact instantlythis is ruin

For an instanta rare occurrence in Jimmie Dales lifehe stood like a
man stricken still staring at the sheet in his hand Then mechanically
his fingers tore the paper into little pieces and the little pieces
into tiny shreds Anger fled and a sickening sense of impotent dismay
took its place the red left his cheeks and in its stead a grayness
came

Act instantly The words seemed to leap at him drum at his ears with
constant repetition Act instantly But how How Then his brainthat
keen clear master brainsprang from stunned inaction into virility
again Of courseCarruthers It was in Carruthers line

He stepped to the deskand paused with his hand extended to pick up the
telephone How explain to Carruthers that he Jimmie Dale already knew
what Carruthers might not yet have heard of even though Carruthers
would naturally be among the first to be in touch with such affairs No
that would never do Better get there himself at once and trust to

The telephone rang

Jimmie Dale waited until it rang again then he lifted the receiver from
the hook

Hello he said

Hello Hello Jimmie came a voice This is Carruthers That you
Jimmie

Yes said Jimmie Dale and sat down limply in the desk chair

Its the Gray Seal again I promised you Id let you in on the ground
floor next time anything happened so come on down here quick if you
want to see some of his work at firsthand

Jimmie Dale flirted a bead of sweat from his forehead

Carruthers said Jimmie languidly you newspaper chaps make me tired
with your Gray Seal Im just going to bed

Bed nothing spluttered Carruthers from the other end of the wire
Come down I tell you Its worth your whilehalf the population of
New York would give the toes off their feet for the chance Come down
you blast idiot The Gray Seal has gone the limit this timeits
MURDER

Jimmie Dales face was haggard

Oh he said peevishly Sounds interesting Where are you I guess
maybe Ill jog along

I should think you would snapped Carruthers You know the Palace on
the Bowery Yes Well meet me on the corner there as soon as you can
Hustle Good

Oh I say Carruthers interposed Jimmie Dale

Yes demanded Carruthers

Thanks awfully for letting me know old man

Dont mention it returned Carruthers sarcastically You always were
a grateful beast Jimmie Hurry up

Jimmie Dale hung up the receiver of the city phone and took down the
receiver of another a privatehouse installation and rang twice for
the garage

The light car at once Benson he ordered curtly At once

Jimmie Dale worked quickly then In his dressing room he changed from
dinner clothes to tweeds spent a second or so over the contents of a
locked drawer in the dresser from which he selected a very small but
serviceable automatic and a very small but highly powerful magnifying
glass whose combination of little round lenses worked on a pivot and
closed over one another were of about the compass of a quarter of a
dollar

In three minutes he was outside the house and stepping into the car
just as it drew up at the curb

Benson he said tersely to his chauffeur drop me one block this
side of the Palace on the Boweryand forget there was ever a speed law
enacted Understand

Very good sir said Benson touching his cap Ill do my best sir

Jimmie Dale in the tonneau stretched out his legs under the front
seat and dug his hands into his pocketsand inside the pockets his
hands were clenched and knotted fists

Murder At times it had occurred to him that there was a possibility
that some crook of the underworld would attempt to cover his tracks and
take refuge from pursuit by foisting himself on the authorities as the
Gray Seal That was a possibility a risk always to be run But that
MURDER should be laid to the Gray Seals door Anger merciless and
unrestrained surged over Jimmie Dale

There was peril here live and imminent Suppose that some day he should
be caught in some little affair recognised and identified as the Gray
Seal there would be the charge of murder hanging over himand the
electric chair to face

But the peril was not the only thing Even worse to Jimmie Dales
artistic and sensitive temperament was the vilification the holding up
to loathing contumely and abhorrence of the name the stainless name
of the Gray Seal It WAS stainless He had guarded it jealouslyas a
man guards the womans name he loves

Affairs that had mystified and driven the police distracted with
impotence there had been many of them and on the face of themcrimes
But no act ever committed had been in reality a crimenone without
the highest of motives the righting of some outrageous wrong the
protection of some poor stumbling fellow human

That had been his partnership with her How by what amazing means by
what power that smacked almost of the miraculous she came in touch with
all these things and supplied him with the data on which to work he
did not knowonly that thanks to her there were happier hearts and
happier homes since the Gray Seal had begun to work Dear Philanthropic
Crook she often called him in her letters And nowit was MURDER

Take Carruthers for instance For years as a reporter before he had
risen to the editorial desk he had been one of the keenest on the scent
of the Gray Seal but always for the sake of the gamealways filled
with admiration as he said himself for the daring the originality of
the most puzzling bewildering delightful crook in the annals of crime
Carruthers was but an example Carruthers now would hunt the Gray Seal
like a mad dog The Gray Seal to Carruthers and every one else would
be the vilest name in the landa synonym for murder

On the car flewand upon Jimmie Dales face as though chiselled in
marble was a look that was not good to see And a mirthless smile set
frozen on his lips

Ill get the man that did this gritted Jimmie Dale between his teeth
Ill GET him And when I get him Ill wring a confession from him if
I have to swing for it

The car swept from Broadway into Astor Place on down the Bowery and
presently stopped

Jimmie Dale stepped out I shall not want you any more Benson he
said You may return home

Jimmie Dale started down the blocka nonchalant Jimmie Dale now if
anything bored a little Near the corner a figure back turned was
lounging at the edge of the sidewalk Jimmie Dale touched the man on the
arm

Hello Carruthers he drawled

Ah Jimmie Carruthers turned with an excited smile Thats the boy
Youve made mighty quick time

Well you told me to hurry grumbled Jimmie Dale Im doing my best
to please you tonight Came down in my car and got summoned for three
fines tomorrow

Carruthers laughed Come on he said and linking his arm in Jimmie
Dales turned the corner and headed west along the cross street This
is going to make a noise he continued a grim note creeping into his
voice The biggest noise the city has ever heard I take back all I
said about the Gray Seal Id always pictured his cleverness as being
inseparable with at least a decent sort of man even if he was a rogue
and a criminal but Im through with that Hes a rotter and a hound
of the rankest sort I didnt think there was anything more vulgar or
brutal than murder but hes shown me that there is A guttersnipes got
more decency To murder a man and then boastfully label the corpse is

Say Carruthers said Jimmie Dale plaintively suddenly hanging back
I say you know itsits all right for you to mess up in this sort
of thing its your beastly business and Im awfully damned thankful to
you for giving me a lookin but isnt iterrather INFRA DIG for me
A bit morbid you know and all that sort of thing Id never hear the
end of it at the clubyou know what the St James is Couldnt I be
Merideth Stanley Annstruther or something like that one of your new
reporters or something like that you know

Carruthers chuckled Sure Jimmie he said Youre the latest
addition to the staff of the NEWSARGUS Dont worry the incomparable
Jimmie Dale wont figure publicly in this

Its awfully good of you said Jimmie gratefully I have to have a
notebook or something dont I

Carruthers from his pocket handed him one Thanks said Jimmie Dale

A little way ahead a crowd had collected on the sidewalk before a
doorway and Carruthers pointed with a jerk of his hand

Its in Moriartys placea gambling hell he explained I havent
got the story myself yet though Ive been inside and had a look
around Inspector Clayton discovered the crime and reported it at
headquarters I was at my desk in the office when the news came and as
you know the interest Ive taken in the Gray Seal I decided to cover
it myself When I got here Clayton hadnt returned from headquarters
so as you seemed so keenly interested last week I telephoned you If
Claytons back now well get the details Claytons a good fellow with
the press and he wont hold anything out on us Now here we are
Keep close to me and Ill pass you in

They shouldered through the crowd and up to an officer at the door
The officer nodded stepped aside and Carruthers with Jimmie Dale
following entered the house

They climbed one flight and then another The cardrooms the faro
stud and roulette layouts were deserted save for policemen here and
there on guard Carruthers led the way to a room at the back of the
hall whose door was open and from which issued a hubbub of voicesone
voice rose above the others heavy and gratingly complacent

Claytons back observed Carruthers

They stepped over the threshold and the heavy voice greeted them

Ah heres Carruthers now Hare you Carruthers They told me youd
been here and were coming back so Ive been keeping the boys waiting
before handing out the dope Youve had a look at thateh He flung
out a fat hand toward the bed

The voices rose again all directed at Carruthers now

Bubbles burst eh Carruthers What about the Prince of Crooks
Artistry in crime wasnt it you said They were quoting from his
editorials of bygone days a half dozen reporters of rival papers
grinning and joshing him goodnaturedly seemingly quite unaffected by
what lay within arms reach of them upon the bed

Carruthers smiled a little wryly shrugged his shouldersand presented
Jimmie Dale to Inspector Clayton

Mr Matthewson a new man of oursinspector

Glad to know you Mr Matthewson said the inspector

Jimmie Dale found his hand grasped by another that was flabby and
unpleasantly moist and found himself looking into a face that was red
with heavy rolls of unhealthy fat terminating in a double chin and a
thick apoplectic necka huge round face with rats eyes

Clayton dropped Jimmie Dales hand and waved his own in the air Jimmie
Dale remained modestly on the outside of the circle as the reporters
gathered around the police inspector

Now then said Clayton coarsely the guy thats croaked there is
Metzer Jake Metzer Get that

Jimmie Dale scribbling hurriedly in his notebook like all the rest
turned a little toward the bed and his lower jaw crept out the fraction
of an inch Both gas jets in the room were turned on full giving ample
light A man fully dressed a man of perhaps forty lay upon his back on
the bed one arm outflung across the bedspread the other dangling
with fingers just touching the floor the head at an angle and off the
pillow It was as though he had been carried to the bed and flung upon
it after the deed had been committed Jimmie Dales eyes shifted and
swept the room Yes everything was in disorder as though there had
been a strugglea chair upturned a table canted against the wall
broken pieces of crockery from the washstand on the carpet and

Metzer was a stool pigeon see went on Clayton and he lived here
Moriarty wasnt on to him Metzer stood in thick with a wider circle of
crooks than any other snitch in New York

Jimmie Dale still scribbling as Clayton talked stepped to the bed and
leaned over the murdered man The murder had been done with a blackjack
evidentlya couple of blows The left side of the temple was crushed
in Right in the middle of the forehead pasted there a graycolored
diamond shaped paper seal flaunted itselfthe device of the Gray Seal
In Jimmie Dale hand hidden as he turned his back the tiny combination
of powerful lenses was focused on the seal

Clayton guffawed Thats right he called out Take a good look
Thats a bright young man youve got Carruthers

Jimmie Dale looked up a little sheepishlyand got a grin from the
assembled reporters and a scowl from Carruthers

Now then continued Clayton heres the factsas much of em as I
can let you boys print at present You know Im stretching a point
to let you in heredont forget that when you come to write up the
casehonour wheres honours due you know Well me and Metzer there
was getting ready to close down on a big piece of game and I was over
here in this room talking to him about it early this afternoon We had
it framed to get our man tonightsee I left Metzer say about three
oclock and he was to show up over at headquarters with another little
bit of evidence we wanted at eight oclock tonight

Jimmie Dale was listeningto every word But he stooped now again over
the murdered mans head deliberately though he felt the inspectors
rats eyes upon himstooped and with his finger nail lifted back the
righthand point of the diamondshaped seal where it bordered a faint
thread of blood on the mans forehead

There was a bulllike roar from the inspector and he burst through the
ring of reporters and grabbed Jimmie Dale by the shoulder

Here you what in hell are you doing he spluttered angrily

Embarrassed and confused Jimmie Dale drew back glanced around and
smiled again a little sheepishly as his eyes rested on the redflushed
jowl of the inspector

II wanted to see how it was stuck on he explained inanely

Stuck on bellowed Clayton Ill show you how its STUCK on if you
monkey around here Dont you know any better than that Where were you
dragged up anyway The coroner hasnt been here yet Youre a hot cub
of a reporter you are He turned to Carruthers Yought to get out
printed instructions for em before you turn em loose he snapped

Carruthers face was red with mortification There was a grin expanded
on the faces of the others

Stand away from that bed roared Clayton at Jimmie Dale And if you
go near it again Ill throw you out of here bodily

Jimmie Dale edged away and eyes lowered fumbled nervously with the
leaves of his notebook

Clayton grunted glared at Jimmie Dale for an instant viciouslyand
resumed his story

I was saying he said that Metzer was to come to headquarters at
eight oclock this evening Well he didnt show up That looked queer
It was mighty important business We was after one of the biggest hauls
wed ever pulled off I waited till nine oclock an hour ago and I
was getting nervous Then I started over here to find out what was the
matter When I got here I asked Moriarty if hed seen Metzer Moriarty
said he hadnt since I was here before He was a little suspicious that
I had something on Metzersee Well by pumping Moriarty he admitted
that Metzer had had a visitor about an hour after I left

Who was it Know what his name is inspector asked one of the
reporters quickly

Inspector Clayton winked heavily Dont be greedy boys he grinned

You mean youve got him burst out another one of the men excitedly

Sure Sure Ive got him Inspector Clayton waved his fat hand airily
Or I will have before morningbut I aint saying anything more till
its over He smiled significantly Well thats about all Youve
got the details right around you I left Moriarty downstairs and came up
here and found just what you seeMetzer laying on the bed there and
the gray seal stuck on his foreheadandhe ended abruptlyIll have
the Gray Seal himself behind the bars by morning

A chorus of ejaculations rose from the reporters while their pencils
worked furiously

Then Jimmie Dale appeared to have an inspiration Jimmie Dale turned a
leaf in his notebook and began to sketch rapidly cocking his head now
on one side now on the other With a few deft strokes he had outlined
the figure of Inspector Clayton The reporter beside Jimmie Dale leaned
over to inspect the work and another did likewise Jimmie Dale drew
in Claytons face most excellently if somewhat flatteringly and then
with a little flourish of pride wrote under the drawing The Man Who
Captured the Gray Seal

Thats a cracking good sketch pronounced the reporter at his side
Let the inspector see it

What is it demanded Clayton scowling

Jimmie Dale handed him the notebook modestly

Inspector Clayton took it looked at it looked at Jimmie Dale then his
scowl relaxed into a selfsufficient and pleased smile and he grunted
approvingly

Thats the stuff to put over he said Mabbe youre not much of
a reporter but you can draw Yre all right sportyre all right
Forget what I said to you a while ago

Jimmie Dale smiled toodeprecatingly And put the notebook in his
pocket

An officer entered the room hurriedly and drawing Clayton aside spoke
in an undertone A triumphant and malicious grin settled on Claytons
features and he started with a rush for the door

Come around to headquarters in two hours boys he called as he went
out and Ill have something more for you

The room cleared the reporters tumbling downstairs to make for the
nearest telephones to get their copy into their respective offices

On the street a few doors up from the house where they were free from
the crowd Carruthers halted Jimmie Dale

Jimmie he said reproachfully you certainly made a mark of us both
There wasnt any need to play the cub so egregiously However Ill
forgive you for the sake of the sketchhand it over Jimmie Im going
to reproduce it in the first edition

It wasnt drawn for reproduction Carruthersat least not yet said
Jimmie Dale quietly

Carruthers stared at him Eh he asked blankly

Ive taken a dislike to Clayton said Jimmie Dale whimsically Hes
too patently after free advertising and Im not going to help along his
boost You cant have it old man so lets think about something
else Whatll they do with that bit of paper thats on the poor devils
forehead up there for instance

Say said Carruthers does it strike you that youre acting queer
You havent been drinking have you Jimmie

Whatll they do with it persisted Jimmie Dale

Well said Carruthers smiling a little tolerantly theyll
photograph it and enlarge the photograph and label it Exhibit A or
Exhibit B or something like thatand file it away in the archives
with the fifty or more just like it that are already in their
collection

Thats what I thought observed Jimmie Dale He took Carruthers by the
lapel of the coat Id like a photograph of that Id like it so much
that Ive got to have it Know the chap that does that work for the
police

Yes admitted Carruthers

Very good said Jimmie Dale crisply Get an extra print of the
enlargement from him thenfor a considerationwhatever he asksIll
pay for it

But what for demanded Carruthers I dont understand

Because said Jimmie Dale very seriously put it down to imagination
or whatever you like I think I smell something fishy here

You WHAT exclaimed Carruthers in amazement Youre not joking are
you Jimmie

Jimmie Dale laughed shortly Its so far from a joke he said in
a low tone that I want your word youll get that photograph into my
hands by tomorrow afternoon no matter what transpires in the meantime
And look here Carruthers dont think Im playing the silly thickhead
and trying to mystify you Im no detective or anything like that Ive
just got an idea that apparently hasnt occurred to any one elseand
of course I may be all wrong If I am Im not going to say a word even
to you because it wouldnt be playing fair with some one else if Im
right the MORNING NEWSARGUS gets the biggest scoop of the century Will
you go in on that basis

Carruthers put out his hand impulsively If youre in earnest
Jimmieyou bet

Good returned Jimmie Dale The photograph by tomorrow afternoon
then And now

And now said Caruthers Ive got to hurry over to the office and get
a writeup man at work Will you come along or meet me at headquarters
later Clayton said in two hours hed

Neither said Jimmie Dale Im not interested in headquarters Im
going home

Well all right then Carruthers returned You can bank on me for
tomorrow Goodnight Jimmie

Goodnight old man said Jimmie Dale and turning walked briskly
toward the Bowery

But Jimmie Dale did not go home He walked down the Bowery for three
blocks crossed to the east side and turned down a cross street Two
blocks more he walked in this direction and halfway down the next
Here he paused an instantthe street was dimly lighted almost dark
deserted Jimmie Dale edged close to the houses until his shadow blended
with the shadows of the wallsand slipped suddenly into a pitchblack
areaway

He opened a door stepped into an unlighted hallway where the air was
close and evil smelling mounted a stairway and halted before another
door on the first landing There was the low clicking of a lock three
times repeated and he entered a room closing and fastening the door
behind him

Jimmie Dale called it his Sanctuary In one of the worst
neighbourhoods of New York where no questions were asked as long as the
rent was paid it had the further advantage of three separate exitsone
by the areaway where he had entered one from the street itself and
another through a back yard with an entry into a saloon that fronted on
the next street It was not often that Jimmie Dale used his Sanctuary
but there had been times when it was no more nor less than exactly what
he called ita sanctuary

He stepped to the window assured himself that the shade was downand
lighted the gas blinking a little as the yellow flame illuminated the
room

It was a rough place dirty uninviting a bedroom furnished in the
most scanty fashion Neither apparently was there anything suspicious
about it to reward one curious enough to break in during the owners
absencesome rather disreputable clothes hanging on the wall and flung
untidily across the bedthat was all

Alone now Jimmie Dales face was strained and anxious and
occasionally as he undressed himself his hands clenched until his
knuckles grew white The gray seal on the murdered mans forehead was
a GENUINE GRAY SEALone of Jimmie Dales own There was no doubt of
thathe had satisfied himself on that point

Where had it come from How had it been obtained Jimmie Dale carefully
placed the clothes he had taken off under the mattress pulled a
disreputable collarless flannel shirt over his head and pulled on a
disreputable pair of boots There were only two sources of supply His
ownand the collection that the police had made which Carruthers had
referred to

Jimmie Dale lifted a corner of the oilcloth in a corner of the room
lifted a piece of the flooring lifted out a little box which he placed
upon the rickety table and sat down before a cracked mirror Who was
it that would have access to the gray seals in the possession of the
police since obviously it was one of those that was on the dead mans
forehead The answer came quick enoughcame with the sudden outthrust
of Jimmie Dales lower jaw ONE OF THE POLICE THEMSELVESno one else
Claytons heavy cunning face Claytons shifty eyes Claytons sudden
rush when he had touched the dead mans forehead pictured themselves
in a red flash of fury before Jimmie Dale There was no mask now no
facetiousness no acted partonly a merciless rage and the muscles of
Jimmie Dales face quivered and twitched MURDER foisted shifted upon
another upon the Gray Sealmaking of that name a calumnyruining
forever the work that she and he might do

And then Jimmie Dale smiled mirthlessly with thinning lips The box
before him was open His fingers worked quicklya little wax behind the
ears in the nostrils under the upper lip deftly placedhands wrists
neck throat and face received their quota of stain applied with an
artists touchand then the spruce muscular Jimmie Dale transformed
into a slouching viciousfeatured denizen of the underworld replaced
the box under the flooring pulled a slouch hat over his eyes
extinguished the gas and went out

Jimmie Dales range of acquaintanceship was widefrom the upper strata
of the St James Club to the elite of New Yorks gangland And adored
by the one he was trusted implicitly by the othernot understood
perhaps by the latter for he had never allied himself with any of
their nefarious schemes but trusted implicitly through long years of
personal contact It had stood Jimmie Dale in good stead before this
association where in a sort of strange carefully guarded exchange
the news of the underworld was common property to those without the law
To New York in its millions the murder of Metzer the stool pigeon
would be unknown until the city rose in the morning to read the
sensational details over the breakfast table here it would already be
the topic of whispered conversations here it had probably been known
long before the police had discovered the crime Especially would it be
expected to be known to Pete Lazanis commonly called the Runt who
was a power below the dead line and more pertinent still one in whose
confidence Jimmie Dale had rejoiced for years

Jimmie Dale as Larry the Bata euphonious monaker bestowed possibly
because this particular world knew him only by nightbegan a search for
the Runt From one resort to another he hurried talking in the accepted
style through one corner of his mouth to hardvisaged individuals behind
dirty reeking bars that were reared on equally dirty and foulsmelling
sawduststrewn floors visiting dance halls secretive back rooms and
certain Chinese pipe joints

But the Runt was decidedly elusive There had been no news of him no
one had seen himand this after fully an hour had passed since Jimmie
Dale had left Carruthers in front of Moriartys The possibilities
however were still legionnumbered only by the numberless dives and
dens sheltered by that quarter of the city

Jimmie Dale turned into Chatham Square heading for the Pagoda Dance
Hall A man loitering at the curb shot a swift searching glance at him
as he slouched by Jimmie Dale paused in the doorway of the Pagoda and
looked up and down the street The man he had passed had drawn a little
closer another man in an apparently aimless fashion lounged a few yards
away

Something up muttered Jimmie Dale to himself Lansing of
headquarters and the other looks like Milrae

Jimmie Dale pushed in through the door of the Pagoda A bedlam of noise
surged out at hima tinpan piano and a mandolin were going furiously
from a little raised platform at the rear in the centre of the room a
dozen couples were in the throes of the tango and the bunnyhug around
the sides at little tables men and women laughed and applauded and
thumped time on the tabletops with their beer mugs while waiters with
beerstained aprons and unshaven faces juggled marvelous handfuls of
glasses and mugs from the bar beside the platform to the patrons at the
tables

Jimmie Dales eyes swept the room in a swift comprehensive glance
fixed on a little fellow loudly dressed who shared a table halfway
down the room with a woman in a picture hat and a smile of relief
touched his lips The Runt at last

He walked down the room caught the Runts eyes significantly as he
passed the table kept on to a door between the platform and the bar
opened it and went out into a lighted hallway at one end of which a
door opened onto the street and at the other a stairway led above

The Runt joined him Wots de row Larry inquired the Runt

Nuthin much said Jimmie Dale Only I tought Id let youse know
I was passin Moriartys an got de tip Say some guys croaked Jake
Metzer dere

Aw ferget it observed the Runt airily Dats stale Was wise to dat
hours ago

Jimmie Dales face fell But I just come from dere he insisted an
de harness bulls only just found it out

Mabbe grunted the Runt But Metzer got his early in de
afternoonsee

Jimmie Dale looked quickly around himand then leaned toward the Runt

Wots de lay Runt he whispered

The Runt pulled down one eyelid and with his knowing grin the
cigarette clinging to his upper lip sagged down in the opposite corner
of his mouth

Jimmie Dale grinned tooin a flash inspiration had come to Jimmie
Dale

Say Runthe jerked his head toward the street doorwots de fly
cops doin out dere

The grin vanished from the Runts lips He stared for a second wildly at
Jimmie Dale and then clutched at Jimmie Dales arm

De WOT he said hoarsely

De fly cops Jimmie Dale repeated in wellsimulated surprise Dey was
dere when I come inLansing an Milrae an

The Runt shot a hurried glance at the stairway and licked his lips as
though they had gone suddenly dry

My Gawd I He gasped and shrank hastily back against the wall
beside Jimmie Dale

The door from the street had opened noiselessly instantly Black forms
bulked therethen a rush of feetand at the head of half a dozen men
the face of Inspector Clayton loomed up before Jimmie Dale There was
a seconds pause in the rush and in the pause Claytons voice in a
vicious undertone

You two ginks open your traps and Ill run you both in

And then the rush passed and swept on up the stairs

Jimmie Dale looked at the Runt The cigarette dangled limply the Runts
eyes were like a hunted beasts

Dey got him he mumbled Its StaceStace Morse He come to me after
croakin Metzer an hes been hidin up dere all afternoon

Stace Morseknown in gangland as a man with every crime in the calendar
to his credit and prominent because of it Something seemed to go
suddenly queer inside of Jimmie Dale Stace Morse Was he wrong after
all Jimmie Dale drew closer to the Runt

Yer givin me a steer aint youse He spoke again from the corner
of his mouth almost inaudibly Are youse sure it was Stace croaked
Metzer Wot fer Howd yer know

The Runt was listening his eyes strained toward the stairs The hall
door to the street was closed but both were quite well aware that there
was an officer on guard outside

He told me whispered the Runt Metzer was fixin ter snitch on him
ternight Deyve got de goods on Stace too He made a bum job of it

Why didnt he get out of de country den when he had de chanst instead
of hangin around here all afternoon demanded Jimmie Dale

He was broke the Runt answered We was gettin de coin fer him ter
fade away wid ternight an

A revolver shot from above cut short his words Came then the sound of a
struggle oaths the shuffling tread of feetbut in the dance hall the
piano still rattled on the mandolin twanged voices sang and applauded
and beer mugs thumped time

They were on the stairs now the officers half carrying half dragging
some one between themand the man they dragged cursed them with utter
abandon As they reached the bottom of the stairs Jimmie Dale
caught sight of the prisoners facenot a prepossessing
onevillainouslowbrowed contorted with a mixture of fear and rage

Its a lie A lie A lie the man shrieked I never seen him in me
lifeblast youcurse youdye hear

Inspector Clayton caught Jimmie Dale and the Runt by the collars

Theres nothing to interest you around here he snapped maliciously
Go on nowbeat it And he pushed them toward the door

They had heard the disturbance in the dance hall now and the occupants
were swarming to the sidewalk A patrol wagon came around the corner In
the crowd Jimmie Dale slipped away from the Runt

Was he wrong after all A fierce passion seized him It was Stace Morse
who had murdered Metzer the Runt had said In Jimmie Dales brain the
words began to reiterate themselves in a singsong fashion It was Stace
Morse It was Stace Morse Then his lips drew tight together WAS it
Stace Morse He would have given a good deal for a chance to talk to the
maneven for a minute But there was no possibility of that now Later
tomorrow perhaps if he was wrong after all

Jimmie Dale returned to the Sanctuary removed from his person all
evidences of Larry the Batand from the Sanctuary went home to
Riverside Drive

In his den there in the morning after breakfast Jason the butler
brought him the papers Threeinch headlines in red ink screamed
exulted and shrieked out the news that the Gray Seal in the person of
Stace Morse fence yeggman and murderer had been captured The public
if it had held any private admiration for the onetime mysterious crook
could now once and forever disillusion itself The Gray Seal was Stace
Morseand Stace Morse was of the dregs of the citys scum a pariah
an outcast with no single redeeming trait to lift him from the ruck
of mire and slime that had strewn his life from infancy The face of
Inspector Clayton blandly selfcomplacent leaped out from the paper
to meet Jimmie Dales eyesand with it a column and a half of perfervid
eulogy

Something at first like dismay the dismay of impotency filled Jimmie
Daleand then cold leaving him unnaturally calm the old merciless
rage took its place There was nothing to do now but waitwait until
Carruthers should send that photograph Then if after all he were
wrongthen he must find some other way But was he wrong The notebook
that Carruthers had given him open at the sketch he had made of
Clayton lay upon the desk Jimmie Dale picked it uphe had already
spent quite a little time over it before breakfastand examined it
again minutely even resorting to his magnifying glass He put it down
as a knock sounded at the door and Jason entered with a silver card
tray From Carruthers already Jimmie Dale stepped quickly forwardand
then Jimmie Dale met the old mans eyes It wasnt from Carruthersit
was from HER

The same shuffer brought it Master Jim said Jason

Jimmie Dale snatched the envelope from the tray and waved the other
from the room As the door closed he tore open the letter There was
just a single line


JimmieJimmie you havent failed have you


Jimmie Dale stared at it Failed FailedHER The haggard look was in
his face again It was the bond between them that was at stakethe Gray
Sealthe bond that had come he knew for all time in that instant to
mean his life

God knows he muttered hoarsely and flung himself into a lounging
chair still staring at the note

The hours dragged by Luncheon time arrived and passedand then by
special messenger the little package from Carruthers came

Jimmie Dale started to undo the string then laid the package down
and held out his hands before him for inspection They were trembling
visibly It was a strange condition for Jimmie Dale either to witness or
experience unlike him foreign to him

This wont do Jimmie he said grimly shaking his head

He picked up the package again opened it and from between two pieces
of cardboard took out a large photographic print A moment two Jimmie
Dale examined it used the magnifying glass again and then a strange
gleam came into the dark eyes and his lips moved

Ive won said Jimmie Dale with ominous softness Ive WON

He was standing beside the rosewood desk and he reached for the phone
Carruthers would be at home nowhe called Carruthers there After a
moment or two he got the connection

This is Jimmie Carruthers he said Yes I got it Thanks   
Yes    Listen I want you to get Inspector Clayton and bring him up
here at once    What No nono    How    Whyertell him
youre going to run a full page of him in the Sunday edition and you
want him to sit for a sketch Hed go anywhere for that    Yes   
Half an hour    YES    Goodbye

Jimmie Dale hung up the receiver and hastily now began to write upon
a pad that lay before him on the desk The minutes passed As he wrote
he scored out words and lines here and there substituting others At
the end he had covered three large pages with to any one but himself
an indecipherable scrawl These he shoved aside now and very
carefully very legibly made a copy on fresh sheets As he finished he
heard a car draw up in front of the house Jimmie Dale folded the copied
sheets neatly tucked them in his pocket lighted a cigarette and was
lolling lazily in his chair as Jason announced Mr Carruthers sir
and another gentleman to see you

Show them up Jason instructed Jimmie Dale

Jimmie Dale rose from his chair as they came in Jason welltrained
servant closed the door behind them

Hello Carruthers hello inspector said Jimmie Dale pleasantly and
waved them to seats Take this chair Carruthers He motioned to one
at his elbow Glad to see you inspectortry that one in front of the
desk youll find it comfortable

Carruthers trying to catch Jimmie Dales eye for some sort of a cue
and failing sat down Inspector Clayton stared at Jimmie Dale

Oh its YOU eh His eyes roved around the room fastened for an
instant on some of Jimmie Dales work on an easel came back finally
to Jimmie Daleand he plumped himself down in the chair indicated
Thought you was moren a cub reporter he remarked with a grin
You were too slick with your pencil Pretty fine studio you got here
Carruthers says youre going to draw me

Jimmie Dale smilednot pleasantlyand leaned suddenly over the desk

Yes he said slowly a grim intonation in his voice going to draw
youTRUE TO LIFE

With an exclamation Clayton slued around in his chair half rose and
his shifty eyes small and cunning bored into Jimmie Dales face

What dye mean by that he snapped out

Just exactly what I say replied Jimmie Dale curtly No more
no less But first not to be too abrupt I want to join with the
newspapers in congratulating you on the remarkableshall I call it
celerity or acumenwith which you solved the mystery of Metzers
death and placed the murderer behind the bars It is really remarkable
inspector so remarkable in fact that its almostSUSPICIOUS Dont
you think so No Well thats what Mr Carruthers was good enough to
bring you up here to talk overin an intimate and confidential way you
know

Inspector Clayton surged up from his chair to his feet his fists
clenched the red sweeping over his faceand then he shook one fist at
Carruthers

So thats your game is it he stormed Trying to crawl out of that
twentyfive thousand reward eh And as for youhe turned on Jimmie
Daleyouve rigged up a nice little plant between you eh Well it
wont workand Ill make you squirm for this both of you damn you
before Im through He glared from one to the other for a momentthen
swung on his heel Goodafternoon gentlemen he sneered as he
started for the door

He was halfway across the room before Jimmie Dale spoke

Clayton

Clayton turned Jimmie Dale was still leaning over the desk but now one
elbow was propped upon it and in the most casual way a revolver covered
Inspector Clayton

If you attempt to leave this room said Jimmie Dale without raising
his voice I assure you that I shall fire with as little compunction as
though I were aiming at a mad dogand I apologise to all mad dogs for
coupling your name with them His voice rang suddenly cold Come back
here and sit down in that chair

The colour ebbed slowly from Claytons face He hesitatedthen sullenly
retraced his steps hesitated again as he reached the chair and finally
sat down

Whatwhat dye mean by this he stammered trying to bluster

Just this said Jimmie Dale That I accuse you of the murder of Jake
MetzerIT WAS YOU WHO MURDERED METZER

Good God burst suddenly from Carruthers

You lie yelled Claytonand again he surged up from his chair

That is what Stace Morse said said Jimmie Dale coolly Sit down

Then Clayton tried to laugh Youreyoure having a joke aint you
It was StaceI can prove it Come down to headquarters and I can prove
it I got the goods on him all the way I tell youhis voice rose
shrillyit was Stace Morse

You are a despicable hound said Jimmie Dale through set lips
Herehe handed the revolver over to Carrutherskeep him covered
Carruthers Youre going to the CHAIR for this Clayton he said in
a fierce monotone The chair You cant send another there in your
placethis time Shall I draw you nowtrue to life Youve been
grafting for years on every disreputable den in your district Metzer
was going to show you up and so Metzer being in the road you removed
him And you seized on the fact of Stace Morse having paid a visit to
him this afternoon to fix the crime onStace Morse Proofs Oh yes I
know youve manufactured proofs enough to convict himif there werent
stronger proofs to convict YOU

Convict ME Claytons lower jaw hung loosely but still he made
an effort at bluster You havent a thing on menot a thingnot a
thing

Jimmie Dale smiled againunpleasantly

You are quite wrong Clayton Seehere He took a sheet of paper from
the drawer of his desk

Clayton reached for it quickly What is it he demanded

Jimmie Dale drew it back out of reach

Just a minute he said softly You remember dont you that in the
presence of Carruthers here of myself and of half a dozen reporters
you stated that you had been alone with Metzer in his room at three
oclock yesterday and that it was youalonewho found the body later
on at nine oclock Yes I mention this simply to show that from your
own lips the evidence is complete that you had an OPPORTUNITY to commit
the crime Now you may look at this Clayton He handed over the sheet
of paper

Clayton took it stared at it turning it over from first one side to
the other Then a sort of relief seemed to come to him and he gulped

Nothing but a damned piece of blank paper he mumbled

Jimmie Dale reached over and took back the sheet

Youre wrong again Clayton he said calmly It WAS quite blank
before I handed it to youbut not now I noticed yesterday that your
hands were generally moist I am sure they are more so nowexcitement
you know Carruthers see that he doesnt interrupt

From a drawer Jimmie Dale took out a little black bottle the notebook
he had used the day before and the photograph Carruthers had sent him
On the sheet of paper Clayton had just handled Jimmie Dale sprinkled a
little powder from the bottle

Lampblack explained Jimmie Dale He shook the paper carefully
allowing the loose powder to fall on the desk blotterand held out the
sheet toward Clayton Rather neat isnt it A very good impression
too Your thumb print Clayton Now dont move You may looknot
touch He laid the paper down on the desk in front of Clayton Beside
it he placed the notebook open at the sketcha black thumb print now
upon it You recall handling this yesterday Im sure Clayton I tried
the same experiment with the lampblack on it this morning you see And
thisbeside the notebook he placed the police photograph that
too in its enlargement showed sharply defined a thumb print on
a diamondshaped background You will no doubt recognise it as an
official photograph enlarged taken of the gray seal on Metzers
foreheadAND THE THUMB PRINT OF METZERS MURDERER You have only to
glance at the little scar at the edge of the centre loop to satisfy
yourself that the three are identical Of course there are a dozen
other points of similarity equally indisputable but

Jimmie Dale stopped Clayton was on his feetrocking on his feet His
face was deathlike in its pallor Moisture was oozing from his forehead

I didnt do it I didnt do it he cried out wildly My God I tell
you I DIDNT do itandandthat would send me to the chair

Yes said Jimmie Dale coldly and thats precisely where youre
goingto the chair

The man was beside himself nowracked to the soul by a paroxysm of
fear

Im innocentinnocent he screamed out Oh for Gods sake dont
send an innocent man to his death It WAS Stace Morse Listen Listen
Ill tell the truth He was clawing with his hands piteously over the
desk at Jimmie Dale When the big rewards came out last week I stole
one of the gray seals from the bunch at headquarters toto use it the
first time any crime was committed when I was sure I could lay my hands
on the man who did it Dont you see Of course hed deny he was the
Gray Seal just as hed deny that he was guiltybut Id have the
proof both ways andand Id collect the rewards andand The man
collapsed into the chair

Carruthers was up from his seat his hands gripping tight on the edge of
the desk as he leaned over it

JimmieJimmiewhat does this mean he gasped out

Jimmie Dale smiledpleasantly now

That he has told the truth said Jimmie Dale quietly It is quite
true that Stace Morse committed the murder Shows up the value of
circumstantial evidence though doesnt it This would certainly have
got him off and convicted Clayton here before any jury in the land But
the point is Carruthers that Stace Morse ISNT the Gray Sealand that
the Gray Seal is NOT a murderer

Clayton looked up Youyou believe me he stammered eagerly

Jimmie Dale whirled on him in a sudden sweep of passion

NO you cur he flashed Its not you I believe I simply wanted your
confession before witnesses He whipped the three written sheets from
his pocket Here substantially is that confession written out He
passed it to Carruthers Read it to him Carruthers

Carruthers read it aloud

Now said Jimmie Dale grimly this spells ruin for you Clayton You
dont deserve a chance to escape prison bars but Im going to give you
one for youre going to get it pretty stiff anyhow If you refuse to
sign this Ill hand you over to the district attorney in half an hour
and Carruthers and I will swear to your confession on the other hand
if you sign it Carruthers will not be able to print it until tomorrow
morning and that gives you something like fourteen hours to put
distance between yourself and New York Here is a penif you are quick
enough to take us by surprise once you have signed you might succeed in
making a dash for that door and effecting your escapewithout forcing
us to compound a felonyunderstand

Claytons hand trembled violently as he seized the pen He scrawled
his namelooked from one to the otherwet his lipsand then taking
Jimmie Dale at his word rushed for the doorand the door slammed
behind him

Carruthers face was hard What did you let him go for Jimmie he
said uncompromisingly

Selfishness Pure selfishness said Jimmie Dale softly Theyd guy me
unmercifully if they ever heard of it at the St James Club The
honour is all yours Carruthers I dont appear on the stage Thats
understood Yes Well thenhe handed over the signed confessionis
the scoop big enough

Carruthers fingered the sheets but his eyes in a bewildered way
searched Jimmie Dales face

Big enough he echoed as though invoking the universe Its the
biggest thing the newspaper game has ever known But how did you come to
do it What started you Where did you get your lead

Why from you I guess Carruthers Jimmie Dale answered thoughtfully
with artfully puckered brow I remembered that you had said last week
that the Gray Seal never left finger marks on his workand I saw one on
the seal on Metzers forehead Then you know I lifted one corner where
the seal overlapped a thread of blood and underneath the thread of
blood wasnt in the slightest disturbed so of course I knew the seal
had been put on quite a long time after the man was deadnot until the
blood had dried thoroughly to a crust you know so that even the damp
surface of the sticky side of the seal hadnt affected it And then
I took a dislike to Clayton somehowand put two and two together
and took a flyer in getting him to handle the notebook I guess thats
allno other reason on earth Jolly lucky dont you think

Carruthers didnt say anything for a moment When he spoke it was
irrelevantly

You saved me twentyfive thousand dollars on that reward Jimmie

Thats the only thing I regret said Jimmie Dale brightly It wasnt
nice of you Carruthers to turn on the Gray Seal that way And
it strikes me you owe the chap whoever he is a pretty emphatic
exoneration after what you said in this mornings edition

Jimmie said Carruthers earnestly You know what I thought of him
before Its like a new lease of life to get back ones faith in him
You leave it to me Ill put the Gray Seal on a pedestal tomorrow that
will be worthy of the immortalsyou leave it to me

And Carruthers kept his word Also before the paper had been an hour
off the press Carruthers received a letter It thanked Carruthers
quite genuinely even if couched in somewhat facetious terms for his
sweeping vindication twitted him gently for his backsliding
begged to remain his gratefully and in lieu of signature there was a
graycoloured piece of paper shaped like this

Picture

Only there were no fingerprints on it



CHAPTER III

THE MOTHER LODE


It was the following evening and they had dined together again at the
St James ClubJimmie Dale and Carruthers of the MORNING NEWSARGUS
From Clayton and a discussion of the Metzer murder the conversation had
turned not illogically upon the physiognomy of criminals in general
Jimmie Dale lazily ensconced now in a lounging chair in one of the
clubs private library rooms flicked a minute speck of cigar ash from
the sleeve of his dinner jacket and smiled whimsically across the table
at his friend

Oh I dare say theres a lot in physiognomy Carruthers he drawled
Never studied the thing you knowthat is from the standpoint
of crime Personally Ive only got one prejudice I distrust on
principle the man who wears a perennial and pompous smirkwhich isnt
of course strictly speaking physiognomy at all You see a man cant
help his eyes being beady or his nose pronounced but pomposity and a
smirk now Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders

Carruthers laughedand then glanced ludicrously at Jimmie Dale as the
door ajar was pushed open and a man entered

Speaking of angels murmured Jimmie Daleand sat up in his chair
Hello Markel he observed casually Youve met Carruthers of the
NEWSARGUS havent you

Markel was fat and important he had beady black eyes fastidiously
trimmed whiskersand a pronounced smirk

Markel blew his nose vigorously coughed asthmatically and held out his
hand

Of course certainly said he effusively Ive met Carruthers several
timesused his sheet more than once to advertise a new bond flotation

The dominant note in Markels voice was an ingratiating and unpleasant
whine and Carruthers nodded not very cordiallyand shook hands

Markel went back to the door closed it carefully and returned to the
table

Fact is he smiled confidentially I saw you two come in here a few
minutes ago and Ive got something that I thought Carruthers might be
glad to have for his society columnsay in the Sunday edition

He dove into the inside pocket of his coat produced a large morocco
leather jewellers case and holding it out over the table between
Carruthers and Jimmie Dale suddenly snapped the cover openand then
with a complacent little chuckle that terminated in another fit of
coughing spilled the contents on the table under the electric reading
lamp

Like a thing of living pulsing fire it rolled before their eyesa
magnificent diamond necklace of wondrous beauty gleaming and
scintillating as the light rays shot back from a thousand facets

For a moment both men gazed at it without a word

Little surprise for my wife volunteered Markel with a debonair wave
of his pudgy hand and trying to make his voice sound careless

The case lay openpatently displaying the name of the most famous
jewelry house in America Jimmie Dales eyes fixed on Markels whiskers
where they were brushed outward in an ornate and fastidious grayblack
sweep

By Jove he commented You dont do things by halves do you
Markel

Two hundred and ten thousand dollars I paid for that little bunch of
gewgaws said Markel waving his hand again Then he clapped Carruthers
heartily on the shoulder What do you think of it Carrutherseh
Say a photograph of it and one of Mrs Markeleh Please her you
knowshes crazy on this society stuntall flubdub to me of course
Hows it strike you Carruthers

Carruthers very evidently liked neither the man nor his manners but
Carruthers above everything else was a gentleman

To be perfectly frank with you Mr Markel he said a little frigidly
I dont believe in this sort of thing Its all right from a newspaper
standpoint and we do it but its just in this way that owners of
valuable jewelry lay themselves open to theft It simply amounts to
advising every crook in the country that you have a quarter of a million
at his disposal which he can carry away in his vest pocket once he can
get his hands on itand you invite him to try

Jimmie Dale laughed What Carruthers means Markel is that youll have
the Gray Seal down your street Carruthers talks of crooks generally
but he thinks in terms of only one He cant help it Hes been
trying so long to catch the chap that its become an obsession Eh
Carruthers

Carruthers smiled seriously Perhaps he admitted I hope though
for Mr Markels sake that the Gray Seal wont take a fancy to itif
he does Mr Markel can say goodbye to his necklace

Pouf coughed Markel arrogantly Overrated His cleverness is all
in the newspaper columns If he knows whats good for him hell know
enough to leave this alone

Jimmie Dale was leaning over the table poking gingerly with the tip of
his forefinger at the centre stone in the setting revolving it gently
to and fro in the lighta very large stone whose weight would hardly
be less than fifteen carats Jimmie Dale lowered his head for a closer
examinationand to hide a curious mocking little gleam that crept into
his dark eyes

Yes I should say youre right Markel he agreed judicially He
ought to know better than to touch this Itit would be too hard to
dispose of

Im not worrying declared Markel importantly

No said Jimmie Dale Two hundred and ten thousand you said
Any specialersignificance to the occasion if the questions not
impertinent Birthday wedding anniversaryor something like that

No nothing like that Markel grinned winked secretively and rubbed
his hands together Im feeling good thats allIm going to make the
killing of my life tomorrow

Oh said Jimmie Dale

Markel turned to Carruthers Ill let you in on that too Carruthers
in a day or two if youll send a reporter aroundfinancial man you
know Itll be worth your while And now how about this What do you
say to a little article and the photos next Sunday

There was a slight hint of rising colour in Carruthers face

If youll send them to the society editor Ive no doubt hell be able
to use them he said brusquely

Right said Markel and coughed and patted Carruthers shoulder
patronisingly again Ill just do that little thing He picked up the
necklace dangled it till it flashed and flashed again under the light
then restored it very ostentatiously to its case and the case to his
pocket Thanks awfully Carruthers he said as he rose from his
chair See you again Dale Goodnight

Carruthers glared at the door as it closed behind the man

Say it prodded Jimmie Dale sweetly Dont feel restrained because
you are a guestI absolve you in advance

Rotter said Carruthers

Well said Jimmie Dale softly You seeCarruthers

Carruthers match crackled savagely as he lighted a cigar

Yes I see he growled But I dont seeyoull pardon my saying
sohow vulgarity like that ever acquired membership in the St James
Club

Carruthers said Jimmie Dale plaintively you ought to know better
than that You know to begin with since it seems he has advertised
with you that he runs some sort of brokerage business in Boston Hes
taken a summer home up here on Long Island and some misguided chap put
him on the clubs visitors list His card will NOT be renewed Sleek
customer isnt he Trifle familiarI was only introduced to him last
night

Carruthers grunted broke his burned match into pieces and began to
toss the pieces into an ash tray

Jimmie Dale became absorbed in an inspection of his handsthose
wonderful hands with long slim tapering fingers whose clean pink
flesh masked a strength and power that was like to a steel vise

Jimmie Dale looked up Going to print a nice little story for him about
the costliest and most beautiful necklace in America he inquired
innocently

Carruthers scowled No he said bluntly I am not Hell read the
NEWSARGUS a long time before he reads anything about that Jimmie

But therein Carruthers was wrongthe NEWSARGUS carried the story of
Markels diamond necklace in threeinch caps in red ink on the front
page in the next mornings editionand Carruthers gloated over it
because the morning NEWSARGUS was the ONLY paper in New York that did
Carruthers was to hear more of Markel and Markels necklace than he
thought though for the time being the subject dropped between the two
men

It was still early barely ten oclock when Carruthers left the club
and preferring to walk to the newspaper offices refused Jimmie Dales
offer of his limousine It was but five minutes later when Jimmie Dale
after chatting for a moment or two with those about in the lobby in
turn sought the coat room where Markel was being assisted into his
coat

Getting home early arent you Markel remarked Jimmie Dale
pleasantly

Yes said Markel and ran his fingers fussily comb fashion through
his whiskers Quite a little run out to my place you knowand with
you know what I dont care to be out too late

No of course concurred Jimmie Dale getting into his own coat

They walked out of the club together and Markel climbed importantly
into the tonneau of a big gray touring car

Ahhome Peters he sniffed at his chauffeur and then with a
grandiloquent wave of his hand to Jimmie Dale Night Dale

Jimmie Dale smiled with his eyeswhich were hidden by the brim of his
hat

Goodnight Markel he replied and the smile crept curiously to
the corners of his mouth as he watched the gray car disappear down the
street

A limousine drew up and Benson Jimmie Dales chauffeur opened the
door

Home Mr Dale he asked cheerily touching his cap Yes
Bensonhome said Jimmie Dale absently and stepped into the car

It was a luxurious car as everything that belonged to Jimmie Dale was
luxuriousand he leaned back luxuriously on the cushions extended
his legs luxuriously to their full length plunged his hands into his
overcoat pocketsand then a change stole strangely slowly over Jimmie
Dale

The sensitive fingers of his right hand in the pocket had touched and
now played delicately over a sealed envelope that they had found there
played over it as though indeed by the sense of touch alone they could
read the contentsand he drew his body gradually erect

It was another of those mysterious missives fromHER The texture of
the paper was invariably the samelike this one How had it come there
Collusion with the coat boy at the club That was hardly probable
Perhaps it had been there before he had entered the club for dinnerhe
remembered now that there had been several people passing and that he
had been jostled slightly in crossing the sidewalk What however did
it matter It was there mysteriously as scores of others had come to
him mysteriously with never a clew to her identity to the identity of
hishe smiled a little grimlyaccomplice in crime

He took the envelope from his pocket and stared at it His fingers had
not been at faultit was one of hers The faint elusive exquisite
fragrance of some rare perfume came to him as he held it

Id give said Jimmie Dale wistfully to himselfId give everything
I own to know who you areand some day please God I will know

Jimmie Dale tore the envelope very gently as though the tearing almost
were an act of desecrationand extracted the letter from within He
began to read aloud hurriedly and in snatches

Through the glasspanelled front of the car Jimmie Dale could see his
chauffeurs back and the hand that held the letter dropped now to his
side and Jimmie Dale staredat his chauffeurs back Then presently
he read the letter again as though committing it to memory now and
then tearing the paper into tiny shreds as he did with every one of
her communications he reached out of the window and allowed the little
pieces to filter gradually from his hand

The Gray Seal He smiled in his whimsical way If it were ever known
He Jimmie Dale with his social standing his wealth his positionthe
Gray Seal Not a police official not a secretservice bureau probably
in the civilised world but knew the namenot a man woman or child
certainly in this great city around him but to whom it was as
familiar as their own Danger Yes A battle of wits Yes His against
everybodyseven against Carruthers his old college chum For even
as a reporter before he had risen to the editorial desk and even now
that he had Carruthers had been one of the keenest on the scent of the
Gray Seal

Danger Yes But it was worth it Worth it a thousand times for the very
lure of the danger itself but worth it most of all for his association
with her who by some amazing means verging indeed on the miraculous
came into touch with all these things and supplied him with the data on
which to workthat always some wrong might be righted or gladness
come where there had been gloom before or hope where there had been
despairthat into some fellow humans heart should come a gleam
of sunshine Yes in spite of the howls of the police the virulent
diatribes of the press an angry public screaming for his arrest
conviction and punishment there were those perhaps who even on their
bended knees at night asked Gods blessing onthe Gray Seal

Was it strange then after all that the police seeking a clew through
motive should have been driven to frenzy on every occasion in finding
themselves forever confronted with what from every angle they were able
to view it was quite a purposeless crime On one point only they
were right the old dogma the old old cry old as the institution of
police older than that old since time immemorialCHERCHEZ LA FEMME
Quite rightbut also quite purposeless Jimmie Dales eyes grew
wistful He had been hunting for the woman in the case himself
now for months and years indefatigably using every resource at his
commandquite purposelessly

Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders Why go over all this tonightthere
were other things to do She had come to him againand this time with
a matter that entailed more than ordinary difficulty more than usual
danger that would tax his wits and his skill to the utmost not only
to succeed but to get out of it himself with a whole skin Markeleh
Jimmie Dale leaned back in his seat clasped his hands behind his
headand his eyes half closed now were studying Bensons back again
through the plateglass front

He was still sitting in that position as the car approached his
residence on Riverside Drivebut as it came to a stop and Benson
opened the door it was a very alert Jimmie Dale that stepped to the
sidewalk

Benson he said crisply I am going downtown again later on but I
shall drive myself Bring the touring car around and leave it in front
of the house Ill run it into the garage when I get backyou need not
wait up

Very good sir said Benson

In the hallway Jason the butler who had been butler to Jimmie Dales
father before him took Jimmie Dales hat and coat

Its a fine evening Master Jim said the privileged old man
affectionately

Jimmie Dale took out his silver cigarette case selected a cigarette
tapped it daintily on the cover of the caseand accepted the match the
old man hastily produced

Yes Jason said Jimmie Dale pleasantly facetious it a fine night
a glorious night moon and stars and a balmy breezequite too fine
indeed to remain indoors In fact you might lay out my gray ulster I
think I will go for a spin presently when I have changed

Yes sir said Jason Anything else Master Jim

No thats all Jason Dont sit up for meyou may go to bed now

Thank you sir said the old man

Jimmie Dale went upstairs opened the door of his own particular den on
the right of the landing stepped inside closed the door switched on
the lightand Jimmie Dales debonair nonchalance dropped from him as a
mask instantlyand it was another Jimmie Dalethe professional Jimmie
Dale

Quick now in every action he swung aside the portiere that curtained
off the squat barrelshaped safe in the little alcove opened the safe
took out that curious leather girdle with its kit of burglars tools
added to it a flashlight and an automatic revolver closed the safeand
passed into his dressing room Here he proceeded to divest himself
rapidly of his evening clothes selecting in their stead a suit of dark
tweed He heard Jason come up the stairs pass along the hall and mount
the second flight to his own quarters and presently came the sound of
an automobile without The dressing room fronted on the DriveJimmie
Dale looked out Benson was just getting out of the touring car
Slipping the leather girdle then around his waist Jimmie Dale put on
his vest then his coatand walked briskly downstairs

Jason had laid out a gray ulster on the hall stand Jimmie Dale put it
on selected a leather cap with motorgoggle attachment that pulled down
almost to the tip of his nose tucked a slouch hat into the pocket of
the ulster and leaving the house climbed into his car

He glanced at his watch as he startedit was a quarter of eleven
Jimmie Dales lips pursed a little

I guess itll make a night of it and a tight squeeze at that to get
back under cover before daylight he muttered Ill have to do some
tall speeding

But at first across the city and through Brooklyn for all his
impatience it was necessarily slowafter that Jimmie Dale took
chances and once on the country roads of Long Island the big
powerful car tore through the night like a greyhound whose leash is
slipped

A half hour passedJimmie Dales eyes shifting occasionally from the
gray thread of road ahead of him under the glare of the dancing lamps
to the road map spread out at his feet upon which from time to time
he focused his pocket flashlight And then finally he slowed the car
to a snails pacehe should be very near his destinationthat very
ultraexclusive subdivision of Charleton Park Manor

On either side of the road now was quite a thickly set stretch of wooded
land rising slightly on the rightand this Jimmie Dale scrutinised
sharply In fact he stopped for an instant as he came opposite to a
wagon trackit seemed to be little more than thatthat led in through
the trees

If its not too far from the seat of war commented Jimmie Dale to
himself as he went on again it will do admirably

And then a hundred yards farther on Jimmie Dale nodded his head in
satisfactionhe was passing the rather ornate stone pillars that marked
the entrance to Charleton Park Manor and on which the initial promoters
of the subdivision the realestate people had evidently deemed it good
advertising policy to expend a small fortune

Another hundred yards farther on Jimmie Dale turned his car around
and returned past the gates to the wagon track again The road was
desertednot a car nor a vehicle of any description was in sight
Jimmie Dale made sure of thatand in another instant Jimmie Dales own
car every light extinguished had vanishedhe had backed it up the
wagon track just far enough in for the trees to screen it thoroughly
from the main road

Nor did Jimmie Dale himself appear again on the main roaduntil just as
he emerged close to the gates of Charleton Park Manor from a short cut
through the woods Also he was without his ulster now and the slouch
hat had replaced the motor cap

Jimmie Dale in the moonlight took stock of his surroundings as he
passed in at a businesslike walk through the gates It was a large park
if that name could properly be applied to it at all and the houseshe
caught sight of one set back from the driveway on the rightwere quite
far apart each in its own rather spacious grounds among the trees

The second house on the right her letter had said Jimmie Dale had
already passed the first onethe next would be Markels thenand it
loomed ahead of him now black and shadowy and unlighted

Jimmie Dale shot a glance around himthere was stillness quiet
everywhereno sign of lifeno sound

Jimmie Dales face became tense his lips tightand he stepped suddenly
from the sidewalk in among the trees They were not thick here of
course the trees and the turf beneath his feet was well keptand
therefore soundless He moved quickly now but cautiously from tree to
tree for the moonlight flooding the lawn and house threw all objects
into bold relief

A minute two three went byand a shadow flitted here and there across
the lightgreen sward like the moving of the trees swaying in the
breezeand then Jimmie Dale was standing close up against one side of
the house hidden by the protecting black shadows of the walls

But here for a moment Jimmie Dale seemed little occupied with the
house itselfhe was staring down past its length to where the woods
made a heavy dark background at the rear Then he turned his head
to face directly to the main road then back again slowly as though
measuring an angle Jimmie Dale had no intention of making his escape by
the roundabout way in which he had been forced to come in order to make
certain of locating the right house the second one from the gatesand
he was getting the bearings of his car and the wagon track now

I guess thatll be about right Jimmie Dale muttered finally And now
for

He slipped along the side of the house and halted where almost on a
level with the ground the French windows of the dining room opened on
the lawn Jimmie Dale tried them gently They were locked

An indulgent smile crept to Jimmie Dales lipsand his hand crept in
under his vest It came out againnot emptyand Jimmie Dale leaned
close against the window There was a faint almost inaudible
scratching sound then a slight brittle crackand Jimmie Dale laid a
neat little fourinch square of glass on the ground at his feet Through
the aperture he reached in his hand turned the key that was in the
lock turned the boltrod handle pushed the doors silently openwide
openleft them openand stepped into the room

He could see quite well within thanks to the moonlight Jimmie Dale
produced a black silk mask from one of the little leather pockets
adjusted it carefully over his face and crossed the room to the hall
door He opened thiswide openleft it openand entered the hall

Here it was darka pitch blackness He stood for a moment
listeningutter silence And thenalert strained tense in an
instant Jimmie Dale crouched against the walland then he smiled a
little grimly It was only some one coughing upstairsMarkelin his
sleep perhaps or perhapsin wakefulness

Im a fool confided Jimmie Dale to himself as he recognised the
cough that he had heard at the club And yetI dont know Ones
nerves get sort of taut Pretty stiff business If Im ever caught the
penitentiary sentence I get will be the smallest part of whats to pay

A round button of light played along the wall from the flashlight in
his handjust for an instantand all was blackness again But in that
instant Jimmie Dale was across the hall and his fingers were tracing
the telephone connection from the instrument to where the wires
disappeared in the baseboard of the floor Another instant and he had
severed the wires with a pair of nippers

Again the quick firefly gleam of light to locate the stair case and the
library door opposite to itand moving without the slightest noise
Jimmie Dales hand was on the door itself Again he paused to listen
All was silence now

The door swung under his hand and left open behind him he was in
the room The flashlight winked oncesuspiciously Then he snapped its
little switch keeping the current on and the ray dodged impudently
here and there all over the apartment

The safe was set in a sort of clothes closet behind the desk she had
said Yes there it wasthe door at least Jimmie Dale moved toward
itand paused as his light swept the top of the intervening desk A
mass of papers books and correspondence littered it untidily The
yellow sheet of a telegram caught Jimmie Dales eye

He picked it up and glanced at it It read


Vein uncovered today Undoubtedly mother lode Enormously rich Put
the screws on at once THURL


Under the mask Jimmie Dales lips twitched

I think Markel you miserable hound said he softly that God will
forgive me for depriving you of a share of the profits Two hundred and
ten thousand I think it was you said the sparklers cost A curious
little sound came from Jimmie Dales lipslike a chuckle

Jimmie Dale tossed the telegram back on the desk moved on behind the
desk opened the door of the closet that had been metamorphosed into
a vaultand the white light travelled slowly searchingly critically
over the shining blackenamelled steel the nickelled knobs and dials
of a safe that confronted him

Jimmie Dale nodded at itfamiliarly grimly

Its number onefourthreetwoone all right he murmured And one
of the best we ever made Pretty tough But Ive done it before Say
half an hour of gentle persuasion It would be too bad to crack it with
soupbesides thats crudeCarruthers would never forgive the Gray
Seal for that

The light went outblackness fell Jimmie Dales slim sensitive
fingers closed on the dials knob his head touched the steel front of
the safe as he pressed his ear against it for the tumblers fall

And then silence It seemed to grow heavier that silence with
each secondto palpitate through the quiet houseto grow pregnant
premonitory of dread of fearit seemed to throb in long undulations
and the stillness grew LOUD A moonbeam filtered in between the edge
of the drawn shade and the edge of the window It struggled across the
floor in a wavering path strayed over the desk and died away shadowy
and formless against the blackness of the opened recess door against
the blackness of the great steel safe the blackness of a huddled
form crouched against it Only now and then in a strange projected
wraithlike effect the moon ray glinted timidly on the tip of a nickel
dial and ghostlike disclosed a human hand

Upstairs Markel coughed again Then from the safe a whisper
heavybreathed as from great exertion

MISSED IT

The dial whirled with faint musical little metallic clicks then
began to move slowly again very very slowly The moonbeam as though
petulant at its own abortive attempt to satisfy its curiosity retreated
back across the floor and faded away

Blackness

Time passed Then from the safe again but now in a low gasp a pant of
relief

Ah

The ear might barely catch the soundit was as of metal sliding in
welloiled grooves of metal meeting metal in a padded thud The massive
door swung outward Jimmie Dale stood up easing his cramped muscles
and flirted the sweat beads from his forehead

After a moment he knelt again There was still the inner doorbut that
was a minor matter to Jimmie Dale compared with what had gone before

Stillness once morea long period of it And then again that cough from
abovea prolonged paroxysm of it this time that went racketing through
the house

Jimmie Dale in the act of swinging back the inner door of the safe
paused to listen and little furrows under his mask gathered on his
forehead The coughing stopped Jimmie Dale waited a moment still
listeningthen his flashlight bored into the interior of the safe

The cash box probably quoted Jimmie Dale beneath his breathand
picked it up from where it lay in the bottom compartment of the safe

The lock snipped under the insistent probe of a delicate little
bluedsteel instrument and Jimmie Dale lifted the cover There was
a package of papers and documents on top held together with elastic
bands Jimmie Dale spent a moment or two examining these then
his fingers dived down underneath and the next minute under the
flashlight the morocco leather case open the diamond necklace was
sparkling and flashing on its white satin bed

A tempting little thing isnt it said Jimmie Dale gently It was
really thoughtful of you Markel to buy that this afternoon

Jimmie Dale replaced the necklace in the cash box set the cash box on
the floor closed the inner door of the safe and swung the outer door
a little inwardbut left it flauntingly ajar Then from a pocket of the
leather girdle beneath his vest he produced his small thin flat metal
case From this from between sheets of oil paper with the aid of a
pair of tweezers he lifted out a gray diamondshaped seal Jimmie
Dale was apparently fastidious He held the seal with the tweezers as
he moistened the adhesive side with his tongue laid the seal on his
handkerchief and pressed the handkerchief firmly against the safeas
usual Jimmie Dales insignia bore no finger prints as it lay neatly
capping the knob of the dial

He reached down picked up the cash boxand then for the second time
that night held suddenly tense alert listening his every muscle
taut A door opened upstairs There came a murmur of voices Then a
momentary lull

Jimmie Dale listened Like a statue he stood there in the black
absolutely motionlesshis head a little forward and to one side
Nothingnot a sound Then a very low curious swishing noise and a
faint creak SOMEBODY WAS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS

Jimmie Dale moved stealthily from the recess and noiselessly to the
desk Very faintly but distinctly now came a pad of either slippered
or bare feet on the stairway carpet Like a cat soundless in his
movements Jimmie Dale crept toward the door of the room Down the
stairs came that pad of feet occasionally came that swishing sound
Nearer the door crept Jimmie Dale and his lips were thinned now his
jaws clamped How near were they together he and this night prowler At
times he could not hear the other at all and besides the heavy carpet
made the judgment of distance an impossibility If he could gain the
hall and in the darkness elude the other the way of escape through
the dining room was open And then within a few feet of the door
Jimmie Dale halted abruptly as a womans voice rose querulously from
the hallway above

You are making a perfect fool of yourself Theodore Markel Come back
here to bed

Jimmie Dales face hardened like stonethe answer came almost from the
very threshold in front of him

I cant sleep I tell youit was Markels voice in a disgruntled
snarl I was a fool to bring the confounded thing home Im going to
take the library couch for the rest of the night

It happened quick thenquick as the winking of an eye Two sharp
almost simultaneous clicks of the electriclight buttons pressed by
Markel and the hall and library were a flood of lightand Jimmie Dale
leaped forward to where in dressing gown and pajamas blankets and
bedding over one arm a revolver dangling in the other hand Markel
stood full before the door in the hallway without

There was a wild yell of terror and surprise from Markel then a
deafening roar and a spit of flame from his revolvera bitter
smothered exclamation from Jimmie Dale as the cash box crashed to the
floor from his left hand and he was upon the other like a tiger

With the impact both men went to the floor grappled and rolled over
and over Half mad with fear shock and surprise Markel fought like a
maniac and his voice in gasping shouts rang through the house

A minute two passedand the men rolled about the hall floor Markel
over middle age and unheathily fat against Jimmie Dales six feet of
muscleonly Jimmie Dales left hand dripping a red stream now was
almost useless

From above came wild confusionwomens voices in little shrieks mens
voices shouting in excitement doors opening running feet And then
Jimmie Dale had snatched the revolver from the floor where Markel
had dropped it in the scuffle and was pressing it against Markels
foreheadand Markel terrorstricken had collapsed in a flabby pliant
heap

Jimmie Dale still covering Markel with the weapon stood up The
frightened faces of women protruded over the banisters above The two
menservants at best none too enthusiastically on the way down stopped
as though stunned as Jimmie Dale swung the revolver upon them

Then Jimmie Dale spoketo Markelpointing the weapon at Markel again

I dont like you Markel he said with cold impudence The only
decent thing youll ever do will be to dieand if those men of yours
on the stairs move another step it will be your death warrant Do you
understand I would suggest that you request them to stay where they
are

Cold sweat was on Markels face as he stared into the muzzle of the
revolver and his teeth chattered

Go back he screamed hysterically at the servants Go back Sit down
Dont move Do what he tells you

Thank you said Jimmie Dale grimly Now get up yourself

Markel got up

Jimmie Dale backed to the library door picked up the cash box tucked
it under his left armpit and faced those on the stairs

Mr Markel and I are going out for a little walk he announced coolly
If one of you make a move or raise an alarm before your master comes
back I shall be obliged in selfdefence to shootMr Markel Mr
Markel quite understands thatI am sure Do you not Mr Markel

Helen screamed Markel to his wife dont let em move For Gods
sake do as he says

Jimmie Dales lips just showing beneath the edge of his mask broadened
in a pleasant little smile

Will you lead the way Mr Markel he requested with ironic
deference Through the dining room please Yes thats right

Markel walked weakly into the dining room and Jimmie Dale followed A
prod in the back from the revolver muzzle and Markel stepped through
the French windows and out on the lawn Jimmie Dale faced the other
toward the woods at the rear of the house

Go on Jimmie Dales voice was curt now uncompromising And step
lively

They passed on along the side of the house and in among the trees Fifty
yards or so more and Jimmie Dale halted He backed Markel up against a
large treenot over gently

II sayMarkels teeth were going like castanets I

Youll oblige me by keeping your mouth shut observed Jimmie Dale
politelyand he whipped the cord of Markels dressing gown loose
and began to tie the man to the tree You have many unpleasant
characteristics Markelyour voice is one of them Shall I repeat that
I do not like you He stepped to the back of the tree Pardon me if I
draw this uncomfortably tight I dont think you can reach around to the
knot No The trunk is too large Quite so He stepped around to face
Markel againthe man was thoroughly frightened his face was livid his
jaw sagged weakly and his eyes followed every movement of the revolver
in Jimmie Dales hand in a sort of miserable fascination Jimmie Dale
smiled unhappily I am going to do something Markel that I should
advise no other man to doI am going to put you on your honour For the
next fifteen minutes you are not to utter a sound Do you understand

Yyes said Markel hoarsely

No said Jimmie Dale sadly I don think you do Let me be painfully
explicit If you break your vow of silence by so much as a second then
tomorrow or the next day or the day after at my convenience Markel
you and I will meet againfor the LAST time There can be no possible
misapprehension on your part nowMarkel

NnoMarkel could scarcely chatter out the word

Quite so said Jimmie Dale in velvet tones He stood for an
instant looking at the other with cool insolence then Goodnight
Markeland five minutes later a great touring car was tearing New
Yorkward over the Long Island roads at express speed

It was one oclock in the morning as Jimmie Dale swung the car into a
cross street off lower Broadway and drew up at the curb beside a large
office building He got out snuggled the cash box under his ulster
went around to the Broadway entrance glanced up to note that a light
burned in a fifthstory window and entered the building

The hallway was practically in darkness one or two incandescents only
threw a dim light about Jimmie Dale stopped for a moment at the foot
of the stairs beside the elevator well to listenif the watchman was
making rounds it was in another part of the building Jimmie Dale began
to climb

He reached the fifth floor turned down the corridor and halted in
front of a door through the groundglass panel of which a light glowed
faintlyas though coming from an inner office beyond Jimmie Dale drew
the black silk mask from his pocket adjusted it tried the door found
it unlocked opened it noiselessly and stepped inside Across the
room through another door half open the light streamed into the outer
office where Jimmie Dale stood

Jimmie Dale stole across the room crouched by the door to look into the
inner officeand his face went suddenly rigid

Good God he whispered As bad as thatbut it was a nonchalant
Jimmie Dale to all outward appearances that on the instant stepped
unconcernedly over the threshold

An elderly man whitehaired kindlyfaced kindlyeyed save now that
the face was drawn and haggard the eyes full of weariness was standing
behind a flattopped desk his fingers twitching nervously on a revolver
in his hand He whirled with a startled cry at Jimmie Dales entrance
and the revolver clattered from his fingers to the floor

I am afraid said Jimmie Dale smiling pleasantly that you were
going to shoot yourself Your name is Wilbur Henry Wilbur isnt it

Unmanned trembling the other stoodand nodded mechanically

Its really not a nice thing to do said Jimmie Dale confidentially
Makes a mess you see toohe was pulling off his motor gauntlet
his ulster his jacket and having set the cash box on the desk was
rolling back his sleeve as he spoke Had a little experience myself
this evening He held out his hand that with the forearm was covered
with blood A little above the wristfortunately only a flesh wounda
little memento from a chap named Markel and

MARKEL The word burst quivering from the others lips

Yes said Jimmie Dale imperturbably Do you mind if I wash a bitand
could you oblige me with a towel or something that would do for a
bandage

The man seemed dazed In a subconscious way he walked from the desk to
a little cupboard and took out two towels

Jimmie Dale stooped while the others back was turned picked up the
revolver from the floor and slipped it into his trousers pocket

Markel said Wilbur again the same trembling anxiety in his voice as
he handed Jimmie Dale the towels and motioned toward a washstand in the
corner of the room Did you say MarkelTheodore Markel

Yes said Jimmie Dale examining his wound critically

You had troublea fight with him Is hehedead

No said Jimmie Dale smiling a little grimly Hes pretty badly
hurt though I imaginebut not in a physical way

Strange whispered Wilbur in a numbed tone to himself and he went
back and sank down in his desk chair Strange that you should speak of
Markelstrange that you should have come here tonight

Jimmie Dale did not answer He glanced now and then at the other as he
deftly dressed his wristthe man seemed on the verge of collapse on
the verge of a nervous breakdown Jimmie Dale swore softly to himself
Wilbur was too old a man to be called upon to stand against the trouble
and anxiety that was mirrored in the misery in his face that had
brought him to the point of taking his own life

Jimmie Dale put on his coat again walked over to the desk and picked
up the phone

If I may he inquired courteouslyand confided a number to the
mouthpiece of the instrument

There was a moments wait during which Wilbur in a desperate sort of
way seemed to be trying to rally himself to piece together a puzzle
as it were and for the first time he appeared to take a personal
interest in the masked figure that leaned against his desk He kept
passing his hands across his eyes staring at Jimmie Dale

Then Jimmie Dale spokeinto the phone

MORNING NEWSARGUS office Mr Carruthers please Thank you

Another waitthen Jimmie Dales voice changed its pitch and register to
a pleasant and natural though quite unrecognisable bass

Mr Carruthers Yes I thought it might interest you to know that
Mr Theodore Markel purchased a very valuable diamond necklace this
afternoon    Oh you knew that did you Well so much the better
youll be all the more keenly interested to know that it is no longer in
his possession    I beg pardon Oh yes I quite forgotthis is the
Gray Seal speaking    Yes    The Gray Seal    I have just
come from Mr Markels country house and if you hurry a man out there
you ought to be able to give the public an exclusive bit of news
a scoop I believe you call ityou see Mr Carruthers I am not
ungrateful for I might say the eulogistic manner in which the MORNING
NEWSARGUS treated me in that last affair and I trust I shall be able
to do you many more favoursI am deeply in your debt And oh yes
tell your reporter not to overlook the detail of Mr Markel in his
pajamas and dressing gown tied to a tree in his parkMr Markel might
be inclined to be reticent on that point and it would be a pity to
deprive the public of anyeratmosphere in the story you know   
What    No I am afraid Mr Markels phone iserout of order
   Yes    And by the way speaking of phones Mr Carruthers
between gentlemen I know you will make no effort under the
circumstances to discover the number I am calling from Goodnight Mr
Carruthers Jimmie Dale hung the receiver abruptly on the hook

You see said Jimmie Dale turning to Wilburand then he stopped The
man was on his feet swaying there his face positively gray

My God Wilbur burst out What have you done A thousand times better
if I had shot myself as I would have done in another moment if you had
not come in I was only ruined thenI am disgraced now You have robbed
Markels safeI am the one man in the world who would have a reason
above all others for doing thatand Markel knows it He will accuse
me of it He can prove I had a motive I have not been home tonight
Nobody knows I am here I cannot prove an alibi What have you done

Really said Jimmie Dale almost plaintively swinging himself up on
the corner of the desk and taking the cash box on his knee really you
are alarming yourself unnecessarily I

But Wilbur stopped him You dont know what you are talking about
Wilbur cried out in a choked way then his voice steadying he rushed
on Listen I am a ruined man absolutely ruined And Markel has ruined
meI did not see through his trick until too late Listen For years
as a mining engineer I made a good salaryand I saved it Two years
ago I had nearly seventy thousand dollarsit represented my life work
I bought an abandoned mine in Alaska for next to nothingI was certain
it was rich A man by the name of Thurl Jason T Thurl another mining
engineer a steamer acquaintance was out there at the timehe was a
partner of Markels though I didnt know it then I started to work the
mine It didnt pan out I dropped nearly every cent Then I struck
a small vein that temporarily recouped me and supplied the necessary
funds with which to go ahead for a while Thurl who had tried to buy
the mine out from under my option in the first place repeatedly then
tried to buy it from me at a ridiculous figure I refused He persisted
I refusedI was confident I KNEW I had one of the richest properties
in Alaska

Wilbur paused A little row of glistening drops had gathered on his
forehead Jimmie Dale balancing Markels cash box on one knee drummed
softly with his finger tips on the cover

The vein petered out Wilbur went on But I was still confident
I sank all the proceeds of the first strikeand sank them fast for
unaccountable accidents that crippled me both financially and in the
progress of the work began to happen Wilbur flung out his hands
impotently Oh its a long storytoo long to tell Thurl was at the
bottom of those accidents He knew as well as I did that the mine was
richbetter than I did for that matter for we discovered before we
ran him out of Alaska that he had made secret borings on the property
But what I did not know until a few hours ago was that he had actually
uncovered what we uncovered only yesterdaythe mother lode He was
driving me as fast as he could into the last ditchfor Markel I
didnt know until yesterday that Markel had any thing to do with it I
struggled on out there hoping every day to open a new vein I raised
money on everything I had except my insurance and the mineand sank
it in the mine No one out there would advance me anything on a property
that looked like a failure that had once already been abandoned I
have always kept an office here and I came back East with the idea of
raising something on my insurance Markel quite by haphazard as I then
thought was introduced to me just before we left San Francisco on
our way to New York On the run across the continent we became very
friendly Naturally I told him my story He played sympathetic good
fellow and offered to lend me fifty thousand dollars on a demand note
I did not want to be involved for a cent more than was necessary and
as I said I hoped from day to day to make another strike I refused
to take more than ten thousand I remember now that he seemed strangely
disappointed

Again Wilbur stopped He swept the moisture from his foreheadand his
fist clenched came down upon the desk

You see the gamethere was bitter anger in his voice now You see
the game He wanted to get me in deep enough so that I couldnt wriggle
out deeper than ten thousand that I could get at any time on my
insurance he wanted me where I couldnt get awayand he got me The
first ten thousand wasnt enough I went to him for a second a third a
fourth a fifthhoping always that each would be the last Each time a
new note a demand note for the total amount was made cancelling the
former one I didnt know his game didnt suspect itI blessed God for
giving me such a frienduntil this or rather yesterday afternoon
when I received a telegram from my manager at the mine saying that
he had struck what looked like a very rich veinthe mother lode
AndWilburs fist curled until the knuckles were like ivory in their
whitenesshe added in the telegram that Thurl had wired the news of
the strike to a man in New York by the name of Markel Do you see I
hadnt had the telegram five minutes when a messenger brought me a
letter from Markel curtly informing me that I would have to meet my note
tomorrow morning I cant meet it He knew I couldnt With wealth in
sightIm wiped out A DEMAND note a call loan do you understandand
with a few months in which to develop the new vein I could pay it
readily As it isI default the noteMarkel attaches all I have left
which is the mine The mine is sold to satisfy my indebtedness Markel
buys it in legally upheld by the lawand acquires ROBS me of it
and

And so said Jimmie Dale musingly you were going to shoot yourself

Wilbur straightened up and there was something akin to pathetic
grandeur in the set of the old shoulders as they squared back

Yes he said in a low voice And shall I tell you why Even if
which is not likely there was something reverting to me over the
purchase price it would be a paltry thing compared with the mine I
have a wife and children If I have worked for them all my life could I
stand back now at the last and see them robbed of their inheritance by a
blackhearted scoundrel when I could still lift a hand to prevent it
I had one way left What is my life I am too old a man to cling to it
where they are concerned I have referred to my insurance several times
I have always carried heavy insurancehe smiled a little curious
mirthless smileTHAT HAS NO SUICIDE CLAUSE He swept his hand over
the desk indicating the papers scattered there I have worked late
tonight getting my affairs in order My total insurance is fiftytwo
thousand dollars though I couldnt BORROW anywhere near the full amount
on itbut at my death paid in full it would satisfy the note My
executors by instruction would pay the noteand no dollar from the
mine no single grain of gold not an ounce of quartz would Markel ever
get his hands on and my wife and children would be saved That is

His words ended abruptlywith a little gasp Jimmie Dale had opened
the cash box and was dangling the necklace under the lighta stream of
fiery flashing sparkling gems

Then Wilbur spoke again a hard bitter note in his voice pointing his
hand at the necklace

But now on top of everything you have brought me disgracebecause
you broke into his safe tonight for THAT He would and will accuse me
I have heard of youthe Gray Sealyou have done a pitiful nights work
in your greed for that thing there

For this Jimmie Dale smiled ironically holding the necklace up
Then he shook his head I didnt break into Markels safe for thisit
wouldnt have been worth while Its only paste

PASTE exclaimed Wilbur in a slow way

Paste said Jimmie Dale placidly dropping the necklace back into its
case Quite in keeping with Markel isnt itto make a sensation on
the cheap

But that doesnt change matters Wilbur cried out sharply after a
numbed instants pause You still broke into the safe even if you
didnt know then that the necklace was paste

Ah but you seeI did know then said Jimmie Dale softly I am
reallyyou must take my word for ita very good judge of stones and I
haderseen these before

Wilbur staredbewildered confused

Then whywhat was it that

A paper said Jimmie Dale with a little chuckleand produced it from
the cash box It reads like this On demand I promise to pay

My note It came in a great surging cry from Wilbur and he strained
forward to read it

Of course said Jimmie Dale Of courseyour note Did you think that
I had just happened to drop in on you Now then see here you just
buck up andersmile There isnt even a possibility of you being
accused of the theft In the first place Markel saw quite enough of me
to know that it wasnt you Secondly neither Markel nor any one else
would ever dream that the break was made for anything else but the
necklace with which you have no connectionthe papers were in the cash
box and were just taken along with it Dont you see And besides the
police with my very good friend Carruthers at their elbows will see
very thoroughly to it that the Gray Seal gets full and ample credit for
the crime ButJimmie Dale pulled out his watch and yawned under his
maskits getting to be an unconscionable hourand youve still a
letter to write

A letter Wilburs voice was broken his lips quivering

To Markel said Jimmie Dale pleasantly Write him in reply to his
letter of the afternoon and post it before you leave herejust as
though you had written it at once promptly on receipt of his He will
still get it on the morning delivery State that you will take up the
note immediately on presentation at whatever bank he chooses to name
Thats all Seeing that he hasnt got it he cant very well present
itcan he Eventually havingerno use for fake diamonds I
shall return the necklace together with the papers in his cash box
hereincluding your note

Eventually Uncomprehendingly stumblingly Wilbur repeated the word

In a month or two or three as the case may be explained Jimmie
Dale brightly Whenever you insert a personal in the NEWSARGUS to
the effect that the mother lode has given you the cash to meet it He
replaced the note in the cash box slipped down to his feet from the
deskand then he choked a little Wilbur the tears streaming down
his face unable to speak was holding out his hands to Jimmie Dale
Iergoodnight said Jimmie Dale hurriedlyand stepped quickly
from the room

Halfway down the first flight of stairs he paused Steps running after
him sounded along the corridor above and then Wilburs voice

Dont gonot yet cried the old man I dont understand How did you
knowwho told you about the note

Jimmie Dale did not answerhe went on noiselessly down the stairs His
mask was off now and his lips curved into a strange little smile

I wish I knew said Jimmie Dale wistfully to himself



CHAPTER IV

THE COUNTERFEIT FIVE


It was still early in the evening but a little after nine oclock
The Fifth Avenue bus wended its way jouncing its patrons particularly
those on the top seats across town and turned into Riverside Drive A
short distance behind the bus a limousine rolled down the cross street
leisurely silently

As the lights of passing craft on the Hudson and a myriad scintillating
luminous points dotting the west shore came into view Jimmie Dale rose
impulsively from his seat on the top of the bus descended the little
circular iron ladder at the rear and dropped off into the street It
was only a few blocks farther to his residence on the Drive and
the night was well worth the walk besides restless disturbed and
perplexed in mind the walk appealed to him

He stepped across to the sidewalk and proceeded slowly along A month
had gone by and he had not heard a word fromHER The break on West
Broadway the murder of Metzer in Moriartys gambling hell the theft
of Markels diamond necklace had followed each other in quick
successionand then this month of utter silence with no sign of her
as though indeed she had never existed

But it was not this temporary silence on her part that troubled Jimmie
Dale now In the years that he had worked with this unknown mysterious
accomplice of his whom he had never seen there had been longer
intervals than a bare month in which he had heard nothing from herit
was not that It was the failure total absolute and complete
that was the only result for the month of ceaseless unremitting
doggedlyexpended effort even as it had been the result many times
before in an attempt to solve the enigma that was so intimate and vital
a factor in his own life

If he might lay any claims to cleverness his resourcefulness at
least he was forced to admit was no match for hers She came she went
without being seenand behind her remained instead of clews to her
identity only an amazing intangible mystery that left him at times
appalled and dismayed How did she know about those conditions in West
Broadway how did she know about Metzers murder how did she know about
Markel and Wilburhow did she know about a hundred other affairs of the
same sort that had happened since that night years ago now when out of
pure adventure he had tampered with Marxs the jewellers strong
room in Maiden Lane and she had mysteriously then too solved HIS
identity discovered him to be the Gray Seal

Jimmie Dale wrapped up in his own thoughts entirely oblivious to his
surroundings traversed another block There had never been since the
world began and there would never be again so singular and bizarre a
partnership as thisof hers and his He Jimmie Dale with his strange
double life one of New Yorks young bachelor millionaires one whose
social status was unquestioned and she whowho WHAT That was just
it Who what What was she What was her name What one personal
intimate thing did he know about her And what was to be the end
Not that he would have severed his association with hernot for
worldsthough every time that by some new and curious method one of
her letters found its way into his hands outlining some fresh coup
for him to execute his peril and danger of discovery was increased in
staggering ratio Today the police hunted the Gray Seal as they hunted
a mad dog the papers stormed and raved against him in every detective
bureau of two continents he was catalogued as the most notorious
criminal of the ageand yet strange paradox no single crime had ever
been committed

Jimmie Dales strong finefeatured face lighted up Crime Thanks to
her there were those who blessed the name of the Gray Seal those
into whose lives had come joy relief from misery escape from death
evenand their blessings were worth a thousandfold the risk and peril
of disaster that threatened him at every minute of the day

Thank God for her murmured Jimmie Dale softly Butbut if I could
only find her see her know who she is talk to her and hear her
voice Then he smiled a little wanly Its been a pretty tough
monthand nothing to show for it

It had It had been one of the hardest months through which Jimmie Dale
had ever lived The St James that most exclusive club his favourite
haunt had seen nothing of him the easel in his den that was his
hobby had been untouched there had been days even when he had not
crossed the threshold of his home Every resource at his command he
had called into play in an effort to solve the mystery For nearly the
entire month following first this lead and then that he had lived in
the one disguise that he felt confident she knew nothing ofthat was
or rather had become almost a dual personality with him From the
Sanctuary that miserable and disreputable room in a tenement on the
East Side a tenement that had three separate means of entrance and
exit he had emerged day after day as Larry the Bat a character as well
known and as well liked in the exclusive circles of the underworld as
was Jimmie Dale in the most exclusive strata of New Yorks society
and fashion And it had been uselessall useless Through his own
endeavours through the help of his friends of the underworld the
lives of half a dozen men Bert Hagans on West Broadway for instance
Markels and others had been laid bare to the last shred but nowhere
could be found the one vital point that linked their lives with hers
that would account for her intimate knowledge of them and so furnish
him with the clew that would then with certainty lead him to a solution
of her identity

It was baffling puzzling unbelievable bordering indeed on the
miraculousherself everything about her her acts her methods her
cleverness intangible in one sense were terrifically real in another
Jimmie Dale shook his head The miraculous and this practical everyday
life were wide and far apart There was nothing miraculous about itit
was only that the key to it was so far beyond his reach

And then suddenly Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders in consonance with
a whimsical change in both mood and thought

Larry the Bat is a hard taskmaster he muttered facetiously Im
afraid Im not very presentable this eveningno bath this morning
and no shave and after nearly a month of makeup that beastly grease
paint gets into the skin creases in a most intimate way He chuckled
as the thought of old Jason his butler came to him I saw Jason
torn between two conflicting emotions shaking his head over the black
circles under my eyes last nighthe didnt know whether to worry over
the first signs of a galloping decline or break his heart at witnessing
the young master he had dandled on his knees going to the damnation
bowwows and turning into a confirmed roue I guess Ill have to mind
myself though Even Carruthers detached his mind far enough from his
editorial desk and the hope of exclusively publishing the news of the
Gray Seals capture in the MORNING NEWSARGUS to tell me I was looking
seedy Its wonderful the way a little paint will metamorphose a man
Well anyway heres for a good hot tub tonight and a fresh start

He quickened his pace There were still three blocks to go and here was
no hurrying jostling crowd to impede his progress indeed as far as he
could see up the Drive there was not a pedestrian in sight And then
as he walked involuntarily insistently his mind harked back into the
old groove again

Ive tried to picture her said Jimmie Dale softly to himself Ive
tried to picture her a hundred yes a thousand times and

A bus rumbling cityward went by him squeaking creaking and rattling
in its uneasy jointsand out of the noise almost at his elbow it
seemed a voice spoke his nameand in that instant intuitively he KNEW
and it thrilled him stopped the beat of his heart as dulcet soft
clear as the note of a silver bell it felland only one word

Jimmie

He whirled around A limousine wheels just grazing the curb was
gliding slowly and silently past him and from the window a womans
arm whitegloved and dainty was extended and from the fingers to the
pavement fluttered an envelopeand the car leaped forward

For the fraction of a second Jimmie Dale stood dazed immovable a
gamut of emotions surprise fierce exultation amazement a strange
joy a mighty uplift swirling upon himand then snatching up the
envelope from the ground he sprang out into the road after the car It
was the one chance he had ever had the one chance she had ever given
him and he had seena whitegloved arm He could not reach the car
it was speeding away from him like an arrow now but there was something
else that would do just as well something that with all her cleverness
she had overlookedthe cars number dangling on the rear axle the
rays of the little lamp playing on the enamelled surface of the plate
Gasping panting he held his own for a yard or more and there floated
back to him a little silvery laugh from the body of the limousine and
then Jimmie Dale laughed too and stoppedit was No 15836

He stood and watched the car disappear up the Drive What delicious
irony A month of gruelling ceaseless toil that had been vain futile
uselessand the key when he was not looking for it unexpectedly
through no effort of his was thrust into his handNo 15836

Jimmie Dale the gently ironic smile still on his lips those slim
supersensitive fingers of his subconsciously noting that the texture of
the envelope was the same as she always used retraced his steps to the
sidewalk

Number fifteen thousand eight hundred and thirtysix said Jimmie Dale
aloudand halted at the curb as though rooted to the spot It sounded
strangely familiar that number He repeated it over again slowly
Onefiveeightthreesix And the smile left his lips and upon his
face came the look of a chastened child She had used a duplicate plate
Fifteen thousand eight hundred and thirtysix was the number of one of
his own carshis own particular runabout

For a moment longer he stood there undecided whether to laugh or swear
and then his eyes fastened mechanically on the envelope he was twirling
in his fingers Here at least was something that was not elusive
that on the contrary as a hundred others in the past had done
outlined probably a grim nights work ahead for the Gray Seal And if
it were as those others had been every minute from the moment of its
receipt was precious time He stepped under the nearest street light
and tore the envelope open

Dear Philanthropic Crook it beganand then followed two closely
written pages Jimmie Dale read them his lips growing gradually
tighter a smouldering light creeping into his dark eyes and once he
emitted a short low whistle of consternationthat was at the end as
he read the postscript that was heavily underscored Work quickly
They will raid tonight Be careful Look out for Kline he is the
sharpest man in the United States secret service

For a brief instant longer Jimmie Dale stood under the street lamp
his mind in a lightningquick way cataloguing every point in her letter
viewing every point from a myriad angles constructing devising
mapping out a plan to dovetail into themand then Jimmie Dale swung on
a downtown bus There was neither time nor occasion to go home nowthat
marvellous little kit of burglars tools that peeped from their tiny
pockets in that curious leather undervest and that reposed now in
the safe in his den would be useless to him tonight besides in the
breast pocket of his coat neatly folded was a black silk mask and
relics of his role of Larry the Bat an automatic revolver an
electric flashlight a steel jimmy and a bunch of skeleton keys were
distributed among the other pockets of his smart tweed suit

Jimmie Dale changed from the bus to the subway leaving behind him
strewn over many blocks the tiny and minute fragments into which he had
torn her letter at Astor Place he left the subway walked to Broadway
turned uptown for a block to Eighth Street then along Eighth Street
almost to Sixth Avenueand stopped

A rather shabby shop a pitiful sort of a place displaying in its
window a heterogeneous conglomeration of cheap odds and ends ink
bottles candy pencils cigarettes pens toys writing pads marbles
and a multitude of other small wares confronted him Within a little
old sweetfaced grayhaired woman stood behind the counter pottering
over the rearrangement of some articles on the shelves

My word said Jimmie Dale softly to himself You wouldnt believe it
would you And Ive always wondered how these little stores managed to
make both ends meet Think of that old soul making fifteen or twenty
thousand dollars from a layout like thiseven if it has taken her a
lifetime

Jimmie Dale had halted nonchalantly and unconcernedly by the curb
not too near the window busied apparently in an effort to light a
refractory cigarette and then about to enter the store he gazed
aimlessly across the street for a moment instead A man came briskly
around the corner from Sixth Avenue opened the store door and went in

Jimmie Dale drew back a little and turned his head again as the door
closedand a sudden quick alert and startled look spread over his
face

The man who had entered bent over the counter and spoke to the old lady
She seemed to listen with a dawning terror creeping over her features
and then her hands went piteously to the thin hair behind her ears The
man motioned toward a door at the rear of the store She hesitated
then came out from behind the counter and swayed a little as though her
limbs would not support her weight

Jimmie Dales lips thinned

Im afraid he muttered slowly Im afraid that Im too late even
now And then as she came to the door and turned the key on the
inside Pray Heaven she doesnt turn the light outor somebody might
think I was trying to break in

But in that respect Jimmie Dales fears were groundless She did not
turn out either of the gas jets that lighted the little shop instead
in a faltering reluctant sort of manner she led the way directly
through the door in the rear and the man followed her

The shop was emptyand Jimmie Dale was standing against the door on the
outside His position was perfectly naturala hundred passersby would
have noted nothing but a most commonplace occurrencea man in the act
of entering a store And if he appeared to fumble and have trouble with
the latch what of it Jimmie Dale however was not fumblinghidden by
his back that was turned to the street those wonderful fingers of his
in whose tips seemed embodied and concentrated every one of the human
senses were working quickly surely accurately without so much as the
wasted movement of a single muscle

A faint tinkleand the key within fell from the lock to the floor A
faint clickand the bolt of the lock slipped back Jimmie Dale restored
the skeleton keys and a little steel instrument that accompanied them
to his pocketand quietly opened the door He stepped inside picked up
the key from the floor inserted it in the lock closed the door behind
him and locked it again

To guard against interruption observed Jimmie Dale a little
quizzically

He was perhaps thirty seconds behind the others He crossed the shop
noiselessly cautiously and passed through the door at the rear It
opened into a short passage that after a few feet gave on a sort of
corridor at right anglesand down this latter facing him at the end
the door of a lighted room was open and he could see the figure of the
man who had entered the shop back turned standing on the threshold
Voices indistinct came to him

The corridor itself was dark and Jimmie Dale satisfied that he was
fairly safe from observation stole softly forward He passed two
doors on his leftand the curious arrangement of the building that had
puzzled him for a moment became clear The store made the front of an
old tenement building with apartments above and the rear of the store
was a sort of apartment toothe old ladys living quarters

Step by step testing each one against a possible creaking of the floor
Jimmie Dale moved forward keeping close up against one wall The man
passed on into the roomand now Jimmie Dale could distinguish every
word that was being spoken and crouched up in the dark corridor in
the angle of the wall and the door jamb itself could see plainly enough
into the room beyond Jimmie Dales jaw crept out a little

A young man gaunt pale wrapped in blankets half sat half reclined
in an invalids chair the old lady on her knees the tears streaming
down her face had her arms around the sick mans neck while the other
man apparently upset at the scene tugged vigorously at long gray
mustaches

Sammy Sammy sobbed the woman piteously Say you didnt do it
Sammysay you didnt do it

Look here Mrs Matthews said the man with the gray mustaches gently
now dont you go to making things any harder Ive got to do my duty
just the same and take your son

The young man a hectic flush beginning to burn on his cheeks gazed
wildly from one to the other

Whatwhat is it he cried out

The man threw back his coat and displayed a badge on his vest

Im Kline of the secret service he said gravely Im sorry Sammy
but I want you for that little job in Washington at the bureaubefore
you left on sick leave

Sammy Matthews struggled away from his mothers arms pulled himself
forward in his chairand his tongue licked dry lips

Whatwhat job he whispered thickly

You know dont you the other answered steadily He took a large
flat pocketbook from his pocket opened it and took out a fivedollar
bill He held this before the sick mans eyes but just out of reach
one finger silently indicating the lower lefthand corner

Matthews stared at it for a moment and the hectic flush faded to a
grayish pallor and a queer impotent sound gurgled in his throat

I see you recognise it said the other quietly Its open and shut
Sammy That little imperfection in the plates got you my boy

Sammy Sammy sobbed the woman again Sammy say you didnt do it

Its a lie said Matthews hoarsely Its a lie That plate was
condemned in the bureau for that imperfectioncondemned and destroyed

Condemned TO BE destroyed corrected the other without raising his
voice Theres a little difference there Sammyabout twenty years
differencein the Federal pen But it wasnt destroyed this note was
printed from it by one of the slickest gangs of counterfeiters in the
United Statesbut I dont need to tell you that I guess you know who
they are Ive been after them a long time and Ive got them now just
as tight as Ive got you Instead of destroying that plate you stole
it and disposed of it to the gang How much did they give you

Matthews face seemed to hold a dumb horror and his fingers picked at
the arms of the chair His mother had moved from beside him now and
both her hands were patting at the mans sleeve in a pitiful way while
again and again she tried to speak but no words would come

Its a lie said Matthews again in a colourless mechanical way

The man glanced at Mrs Matthews as he put the fivedollar note back
into his pocket seemed to choke a little shook his head and all trace
of the official sternness that had crept into his voice disappeared

Its no good he said in a low tone Dont do that Mrs Matthews
Ive got to do my duty He leaned a little toward the chair Its dead
to rights Sammy You might as well make a clean breast of it It was
up to you and Al Gregor to see that the plate was destroyed It WASNT
destroyed instead it shows up in the hands of a gang of counterfeiters
that Ive been watching for months Furthermore Ive got the plate
itself And finally though I havent placed him under arrest yet for
fear you might hear of it before I wanted you to and make a getaway
Ive got Al Gregor where I can put my hands on him and Ive got his
confession that you and he worked the game between you to get that plate
out of the bureau and dispose of it to the gang

Oh my Godit came in a wild cry from the sick man and in a
desperate lurching way he struggled up to his feet Al Gregor said
that Thenthen Im done He clutched at his temples But its not
trueits not true If the plate was stolen and it must have been
stolen or that note wouldnt have been found it was Al Gregor who
stole itI didnt I tell you I knew nothing of it except that he and
I were responsible for it andand I left it to himthats the only way
Im to blame Hes caught and hes trying to get out of it with a light
sentence by pretending to turn States evidence butbut Ill fight
himhe cant prove itits only his word against mine and

The other shook his head again

Its no good Sammy he said a touch of sternness back in his tones
again I told you it was open and shut Its not only Al Gregor One
of the gang got weak knees when I got him where I wanted him the other
night and he swears that you are the one who DELIVERED the plate to
them Between him and Gregor and what I know myself Ive got evidence
enough for any jury against every one of the rest of you

Horror fear helplessness seemed to mingle in the sick mans staring
eyes and he swayed unsteadily upon his feet

Im innocent he screamed out But Im caught Im caught in a net
and I cant get outthey lied to youbut no one will believe it any
more than you do andand it means twenty years for meoh Godtwenty
years and His hands went wriggling to his temples again and he
toppled back in a faint into the chair

Youve killed him Youve killed my boy the old lady shrieked out
piteously and flung herself toward the senseless figure

The man jumped for the table across the room on which was a row of
bottles snatched one up drew the cork smelled it and ran back with
the bottle He poured a little of the contents into his cupped hand
held it under young Matthews nostrils and pushed the bottle into Mrs
Matthews hands

Bathe his forehead with this Mrs Matthews he directed reassuringly
Hell be all right again in a moment There seehes coming around
now

There was a long fluttering sigh and Matthews opened his eyes then
a moments silence and then he spoke with an effort with long pauses
between the words

AmItogonow

The words seemed to ring absolute terror in the old ladys ears She
turned and dropped to her knees on the floor

Mr Kline Mr Kline she sobbed out oh for Gods love dont take
him Let him off let him go Hes my boyall Ive got Youve got
a mother havent you You know The tears were streaming down the
sweet old face again Oh wont you for Gods dear name wont you
let him go Wont

Stop the man cried huskily He was mopping at his face with his
handkerchief I thought I was casehardened I ought to bebut I guess
Im not But Ive got to do my duty Youre only making it worse for
Sammy there as well as me

Her arms were around his knees now clinging there

Why cant you let him off she pleaded hysterically Why cant
you Why cant you Nobody would know and Id do anythingId pay
anythinganythingIll give you tenfifteen thousand dollars

My poor woman he said kindly placing his hand on her head you are
talking wildly Apart altogether from the question of duty even if
I succeeded in hushing the matter up I would probably at least be
suspected and certainly discharged and I have a family to supportand
if I were caught Id get ten years in the Federal prison for it Im
sorry for this I believe its your boys first offence and if I could
let him off I would

But you canyou can she burst out rocking on her knees clinging
tighter still to him as though in a paroxysm of fear that he might
somehow elude her It will kill himit will kill my boy And you can
save him And even if they discharged you what would that mean against
my boys life You wouldnt suffer your family wouldnt suffer
IllIll take care of thatperhaps I could raise a little more than
fifteen thousandbut oh have pity have mercydont take him away

The man stared at her a moment stared at the white face on the
reclining chairand passed his hand heavily across his eyes

You will You will It came in a great surging cry of joy from the old
lady You willoh thank God thank GodI can see it in your face

II guess Im soft he said huskily and stooped and raised Mrs
Matthews to her feet Dont cry any more Itll be all rightitll be
all right IllIll fix it up somehow I havent made any arrests yet
andwell Ill take my chances Ill get the plate and turn it over to
you tomorrow onlyonly its got to be destroyed in my presence

Yes yes she cried trying to smile through her tearsand then
she flung her arms around her sons neck again And when you come
tomorrow Ill be ready with the money to do my share too and

But Sammy Matthews shook his head

Youre wrong both of you he said weakly Youre a white man
Kline But destroying that plate wont save me The minute a single note
printed from it shows up theyll know back there in Washington that the
plate was stolen and

No youre safe enough there the other interposed heavily Knowing
what was up you dont think Id give the gang a chance to get them
into circulation do you I got them all when I got the plate Andhe
smiled a little anxiouslyIll bring them here to be destroyed with
the plate It would finish me now as well as you if one of them ever
showed up Say he said suddenly with a catch in his breath II
dont think I know what Im doing

Mrs Matthews reached out her hands to him

What can I say to you she said brokenly What

Jimmie Dale drew back along the wall A little way from the door he
quickened his pace still moving however with extreme caution They
were still talking behind him as he turned from the corridor into the
passageway leading to the store and from there into the store itself
And then suddenly in spite of caution his foot slipped on the bare
floor It was not muchjust enough to cause his other foot poised
tentatively in air to come heavily down and a loud and complaining
creak echoed from the floor

Jimmie Dales jaws snapped like a steel trap From down the corridor
came a sudden excited exclamation in the little old ladys voice and
then her steps sounded running toward the store In the fraction of a
second Jimmie Dale was at the front door

Clumsy blundering fool he whispered fiercely to himself as he turned
the key opened the door noiselessly until it was just ajar and turned
the key in the lock again leaving the bolt protruding out One step
backward and he was rapping on the counter with his knuckles Isnt
anybody here he called out loudly Isnt anyohas Mrs Matthews
appeared in the back doorway A package of cigarettes please

She stared at him a little frightened her eyes red and swollen with
recent crying

Howhow did you get in here she asked tremendously

I beg your pardon inquired Jimmie Dale in polite surprise

II locked the doorIm sure I did she said more to herself than
to Jimmie Dale and hurried across the floor to the door as she spoke

Jimmie Dale still politely curious turned to watch her For a moment
bewilderment and a puzzled look were in her faceand then a sort of
surprised relief

I must have turned the key in the lock without shutting the door
tight she explained for I knew I turned the key

Jimmie Dale bent forward to examine the lockand nodded

Yes he agreed with a smile I should say so Then gravely
courteous Im sorry to have intruded

It is nothing she answered and evidently anxious to be rid of him
moved quickly around behind the counter What kind of cigarettes do you
want

Egyptiansany kind said Jimmie Dale laying a bill on the counter

He pocketed the cigarettes and his change and turned to the door

Goodevening he said pleasantlyand went out

Jimmie Dale smiled a little curiously a little tolerantly As he
started along the street he heard the door of the little shop close
with a sort of supercareful bang the key turned and the latch rattle
to try the doorthe little old lady was bent on making no mistake a
second time

And then the smile left Jimmie Dales lips his face grew strained and
serious and he broke into a run down the block to Sixth Avenue Here he
paused for an instantthere was the elevated the surface carswhich
would be the quicker He looked up the avenue There was no train
coming the nearest surface car was blocks away He bit his lips in
vexationand then with a jump he was across the street and hailing a
passing taxicab that his eyes had just lighted on

Got a fare called Jimmie Dale

No sir answered the chauffeur bumping his car to an abrupt halt

Good Jimmie Dale ran alongside and yanked the door open Do you
know where the Palace Saloon on the Bowery is

Yes sir replied the man

Jimmie Dale held a tendollar bank note up before the chauffeurs eyes

Earn that in four minutes then he snappedand sprang into the cab

The taxicab swerved around on little better than two wheels started on
a mad dash down the Avenueand Jimmie Dale braced himself grimly in
his seat The cab swerved again tore across Waverly Place circuited
Washington Square crossed Broadway and whirled finally into the upper
end of the Bowery

Jimmie Dale spoke onceto himselfplaintively

Its too bad I cant let old Carruthers in on this for a scoop with his
precious MORNING NEWSARGUSbut if I get out of it alive myself Ill
do well Wonder if the dayll ever come when he finds out that his very
dear friend and old college pal Jimmie Dale is the Gray Seal that hes
turned himself inside out for about four years now to catch and that
hed trade his soul with the devil any time to lay hands on Good old
Carruthers The most puzzling bewildering delightful crook in the
annals of crimeam I

The cab drew up at the curb Jimmie Dale sprang out shoved the bill
into the chauffeurs hand stepped quickly across the sidewalk and
pushed his way through the swinging doors of the Palace Saloon Inside
leisurely and nonchalantly he walked down past the length of the bar to
a door at the rear This opened into a passageway that led to the side
entrance of the saloon on the cross street Jimmie Dale emerged from
the side entrance crossed the street retraced his steps to the Bowery
crossed over and walked rapidly down that thoroughfare for two blocks
Here he turned east into the cross street and here once more his pace
became leisurely and unhurried

Its a strange coincidence though possibly a very happy one said
Jimmie Dale as he walked along that it should be on the same street
as the Sanctuaryah this ought to be the place

An alleyway corresponding to the one that flanked the tenement where
as Larry the Bat he had paid room rent as a tenant for several years
in fact the alleyway next above it and but a short block away
intersected the street narrow black and uninviting Jimmie Dale as
he passed peered down its length

No lightthats good commented Jimmie Dale to himself Then Window
opens on alleyway ten feet from groundshoe store Russian Jew in
basementgo in front doorstraight hallwayroom at endRussian
Jew probably accomplicebe careful that he does not hear you moving
overheadJimmie Dales mind with that curious faculty of his was
subconsciously repeating snatches from her letter word for word even
as he noted the dimly lighted untidy and disorderly interior of what
from strings of leather slippers that decorated the cellarlike entrance
was evidently a cheap and shoddy shoe store in the basement of the
building

The building itself was rickety and tumbledown three stories high and
given over undoubtedly to gregarious foreigners of the poorer class a
rabbit burrow as it were having a multitude of roomers and lodgers
There was nothing ominous or even secretive about itup the short
flight of steps to the entrance even the door hung carelessly half
open

Jimmie Dales slouch hat was pulled a little farther down over his eyes
as he mounted the steps and entered the hallway He listened a moment
A sort of subdued querulous hubbub seemed to hum through the place as
voices mens womens and childrens echoing out from their various
rooms above mingled together and floated down the stairways in a
discordant medley Jimmie Dale stepped lightly down the length of
the halland listened again this time intently with his ear to the
keyhole of the door that made the end of the passage There was not a
sound from within He tried the door smiled a little as he reached for
his keys worked over the lockand straightened up suddenly as his
ear caught a descending step on the stairs It was two flights up
howeverand the door was unlocked now Jimmie Dale opened it and like
a shadow slipped inside and as he locked the door behind him smiled
once morethe door lock was but a paltry makeshift at best but INSIDE
his fingers had touched a massive steel bolt that when shot home would
yield when the door itself yieldedand not before Without moving the
bolt he turnedand his flashlight for a moment swept the room

Not much like the way they describe this sort of place in storybooks
murmured Jimmie Dale capriciously But I get the idea Mr Russian Jew
downstairs makes a bluff at using it for a storeroom

Again the flashlight made a circuit Here there and everywhere
seemingly without any attempt at order were piles of wooden shipping
cases Only the centre of the room was clear and empty that and a
vacant space against the wall by the window

Jimmie Dale moving without sound went to the window There was a shade
on it and it was pulled down He reached up underneath it felt for
the window fastening and unlocked it then cautiously tested the window
itself by lifting it an inch or twoit slid easily in its grooves

He stood then for a moment hardfaced a frown gathering his forehead
into heavy furrows as the flashlights ray again and again darted
hither and thither There was nothing absolutely nothing in the room
but wooden packing cases He lifted the cover of the one nearest to him
and looked inside It was quite empty except for some pieces of heavy
cord and a few cardboard shoe boxes that in turn were empty too

Its here of course said Jimmie Dale thoughtfully to himself
Clever work too But I cant move half a hundred packing cases without
that chap below hearing me and I cant do it in ten minutes either
which I imagine is the outside limit of time Fortunately though
these cases are not without their compensationa dozen men could hide
here

He began to move about the room And now he stooped before one pile of
boxes and then another curiously attempting to lift up the entire pile
from the bottom Some he could not move others by exerting all his
strength gave a little and then finally over in one corner he found
a pile that appeared to answer his purpose

These are certainly empty he muttered

There was just room to squeeze through between them and the next stack
of cases alongside but once through by the simple expedient of moving
the cases out a little to take advantage of the angle made by the
corner of the room he obtained ample space to stand comfortably upright
against the wall But Jimmie Dale was not satisfied yet Could he see
out into the room He experimented with his flashlightand carefully
shifted the screen of cases before him a little to one side And yet
still he was not satisfied With a sort of ironical droop at the
corners of his lips as though suddenly there had flashed upon him the
inspiration that fathered one of those whimsical ideas and fancies that
were so essentially a characteristic of Jimmie Dale he came out from
behind the cases went across the room to the case he had opened when he
first entered took out the cord and the cover of one of the cardboard
shoe boxes and with these returned to his hiding place once more

The sounds from the upper stories of the tenement now reached him hardly
at all but from below directly under his feet almost he could hear
some one the proprietor of the shoe store probably walking about

Tense every faculty now on the alert his head turned in a strained
attentive attitude Jimmie Dale threw on the flashlights tiny switch
took that intimate and thin metal case from his pocket extracted a
diamondshaped gray paper seal with the little tweezers moistened the
adhesive side and stuck it in the centre of the white cardboardbox
cover then tore the edges of the cardboard down until the whole was
just small enough to slip into his pocket Through the cardboard he
looped a piece of cord placard fashion and with his pencil printed the
four wordswith the compliments of above the gray seal He
surveyed the result with a grim mirthless chuckleand put the piece of
cardboard in his pocket

Im taking the longest chances I ever took in my life said Jimmie
Dale very seriously to himself as his fingers twisted and doubled
and tied the remaining pieces of cord together and finally fashioned a
running noose in one end I dont The cord and the flashlight went
into his pocket the room was in darkness the black mask was whipped
from his breast pocket and adjusted to his face and his automatic was
in his hand

Came the creak of a footstep as though on a ladder exactly below him
another and another receding curiously in its direction yet at the
same time growing louder in sound as if nearer the floorthen a crack
of light showed in the floor in the centre of the room This held for
an instant then expanded suddenly into a great luminous squareand
through a trapdoor opened wide now a mans head appeared

Jimmie Dales eyes fixed through the space between the piles of cases
narrowedthere was indeed little doubt but that the shoestore
proprietor below was an accomplice The store served a most convenient
purpose in every respectas a secret means of entry into the room as
a sort of guarantee of innocence for the room itself Why not To the
superficial observer to the man who might by some chance blunder into
the roomit was but an adjunct of the store itself

The man in the trapdoorway paused with his shoulders above the floor
looked around listened then drew himself up walked across the floor
and shot the heavy bolt on the door that led into the hallway of the
house He returned then to the trapdoor bent over it and whistled
softly Two more men in answer to the summons came up into the room

The Capll be along in a minute one of them said Turn on the
light

A switch clicked flooding the room with sudden brilliancy from half a
dozen electric bulbs

Too many grunted the same voice again We aint working
tonightturn out half of em

The sudden transition from the darkness for a moment dazzled Jimmie
Dales eyesbut the next moment he was searching the faces of the three
men There were few crooks few denizens of the crime world below the
now obsolete but still famous dead line that as Larry the Bat he did
not know at least by sight

Moulton Whitie Burns and Marty Dean confided Jimmie Dale softly
to himself And I dont know of any worse exceptthe Cap And gun
fighters every one of them toonice odds to say nothing of

Heres the Cap now announced one of the three Hello Cap whered
you raise the mustache

Jimmie Dales eyes shifted to the trapdoor and into them crept a
contemptuous and sardonic smilethe man who was coming up now and
hoisting himself to the floor was the man who half an hour before had
threatened young Sammy Matthews with arrest

The Cap alias Bert Malone alias a score of other names closed the
trapdoor after him pulled off his mustache and gray wig tucked them in
his pocket and faced his companions brusquely

Never mind about the mustache he said curtly Get busy the lot of
you Stir around and get the works out

What for inquired Whitie Burns a sharp ferretfaced little man We
got enough of the old stuff on hand now and that bum break Gregor made
when he pinched the cracked plate put the finish on that Say Cap

Close your face Whitie and get the works out Malone cut in shortly
Weve only got the whole night ahead of usbut well need it all
Were going to run the queer off that cracked plate

One of the others Marty Dean this time a certain brutal aggressiveness
in both features and physique edged forward

Say whats the lay he demanded A joke We printed one fiver off
that plateand then we knew enough to quit With that crack along
the corner you couldnt pass em on a blind man And Gregor saying he
thought we could patch the plate up enough to get by with gives me a
painhes got jingles in his dome factory Run them fivers ehsay are
you cracked too

Aw forget it observed Malone caustically Whos running this gang
Then with a malicious grin I got a customer for those fiversfifteen
thousand dollars for all we can turn out tonight See

The others stared at him for a moment incredulity and greed mingling in
a curious halfhesitant halfexpectant look on their faces

Then Whitie Burns spoke circling his lips with the tip of his tongue

Dye mean it Caphonest Whats the lay Howd you work it

Malone unbending with the sensation he had created grinned again

Easy enough he said offhandedly It was like falling off a log
Gregor said didnt he that the only way he had been able to get
his claws on that plate was on account of young Matthews going away
sickeh Well the old Matthews woman his mother has got moneyabout
fifteen thousand I guess she aint got any more than that or Id have
raised the ante Aw it was easy She threw it at me I framed one up on
them thats all Im Kline of the secret servicesee I dont suppose
theyd ever seen him though theyd know his name fast enough but I
made up something like him I showed them where I had a case against
Sammy for pinching the plate that was strong enough to put a hundred
innocent men behind the bars Of course he knew well enough he was
innocent but he could see the twenty years I showed him with both eyes
Say he mussed all over the place and went and fainted like a girl And
then the old woman came across with an offer of fifteen thousand for the
plate and corrupted me Malones cunning vicious face now that
the softening effects of the gray hair and mustache were gone seemed
accentuated diabolically by the grin broadening into a laugh as he
guffawed

Marty Deans hand swung with a bang to Malones shoulder

Say Capsay youre all right he exclaimed excitedly Youre
the boy But whats the good of running anything off the plate before
turning it over to emthe stuffs no good to us

You got a wooden nut with sawdust for brains said Malone
sarcastically If hed thought the gang of counterfeiters that was
supposed to have bought the plate from him had run off only one fiver
and then stopped because they say it wouldnt get by and werent going
to run any more and just destroy the plate like it was supposed to have
been destroyed to begin with and it all end up with no one the wiser
where dye think wed have banked that fifteen thousand I told him I
had the whole run confiscated and that the queer went with the plate
so well just make that little run tonightthats why I sent word
around to you this morning

By the jumping ejaculated Whitie Burns heavy with admiration You
got a head on you Cap

Its a good thing for some of you that I have returned Malone
complacently But dont stand jawing all night Go on nowget busy

There was no surprise in Jimmie Dales facehe had chosen his position
behind a pile of cases that he had been extremely careful as a man
is careful when his life hangs in the balance to assure himself were
empty None of the four came near or touched the pile behind which he
stood but here and there about the room they pulled this one and that
one out from various stacks In scarcely more than a moment the room
was completely transformed It was no longer a storeroom for surplus
stock for the storage of bulky and empty packing cases From the cases
the men had picked out like a touch of magic appeared a veritable
printing plant an elaborate engravers outfita highly efficient
footpower press rapidly being assembled by Whitie Burns an electric
dryer inks a pile of white silkthreaded banknote paper a cutter
and a score of other appurtenances

Yes said Jimmie Dale very gently to himself Yes quite sobut the
plate Ah Malone was taking it out from the middle of a bundle of old
newspapers loosely tied together that he had lifted from one of the
cases

Jimmie Dales eyes fastened on itand from that instant never left it
A minute passed two three of themthe four men were silently busy
about the roomMalone was carefully cleaning the plate

They will raid tonight Look out for Kline he is the sharpest man in
the United State secret servicethe warning in her letter was running
through Jimmie Dales mind Klinethe real Klinewas going to raid
the place tonight When At what time It must be nearly eleven oclock
already and

It came sudden quick as the crack of dooma terrific crash against the
bolted doorbut the door undoubtedly to the surprise of those without
held fast thanks to the bolt The four men whitefaced seemed for an
instant turned to statues Came another crash against the doorand a
sharp imperative order to those within to open it and surrender

Were pinched Beat it whispered Whitie Burns wildlyand dashed for
the trapdoor

Like a rat for its hole Marty Dean followed Malone farther away
dropped the plate on the floor and rushed with Moulton beside him
after the othersbut he never reached the trapdoor

Over the crashing blows raining now in quick succession on the door of
the room over a startled commotion as lodgers roomers and tenants on
the floor above awoke into frightened activity with shouts and cries
came the louder crash of a pile of packing boxes hurled to the floor
And over them vaulting those scattered in his way Jimmie Dale sprang
at Malone The man reeled back with a cry Moulton dashed through
the trapdoor and disappeared The short ugly barrel of Jimmie Dales
automatic was between Malones eyes

You make a move said Jimmie Dale in a low sibilant way and
Ill drop you where you stand Put your hands behind your backpalms
together

Malone dazed cowed obeyed A panel of the door split and rent down
its lengththe hinges were sagging Jimmie Dale worked like lightning
The cord with the slip noose from his pocket went around Malones
wrists jerked tight and knotted the placard his lips grim with no
sign of humour Jimmie Dale dangled around the mans neck

An introduction for you to Mr Kline out therethat you seem so fond
of gritted Jimmie Dale Then working as he talked Ive got no time
to tell you what I think of you you pitiful houndhe snatched up the
plate from the floor and put it in his pocketTwenty years I think
you said didnt youhis hand shot into Malones pocketbook and
extracted the fivedollar noteIf you can open this with your toes
maybe you can get a wayhe wrenched the trapdoor over and slammed it
shutgoodnight Maloneand he leaped for the window

The door tottered inward from the top ripping tearing smashing
hinges panels and jamb Jimmie Dale got a blurred vision of brass
buttons blue coats and helmets and in the forefront of a stocky
graymustached grayhaired man in plain clothes

Jimmie Dale threw up the window swung out as with a rush the officers
burst through into the room and a revolver bullet hummed viciously past
his ear and dropped to the groundinto encircling arms

Ah no you dont my bucko snapped a hoarse voice in his ear Keep
quiet now or Ill crack your beanunderstand

But the officer too heavy to be muscular was no match for Jimmie
Dale who even as he had dropped from the sill had caught sight of
the lurking form below and now with a quick sudden lithe movement he
wriggled loose his fist from a shortarm jab smashed upon the point of
the others jaw sending the man staggering backwardand Jimmie Dale
ran

A crowd was already collecting at the mouth of the alleyway mostly
occupants of the house itself and into these scattering them in all
directions eluding dexterously another officer who made a grab for him
Jimmie Dale charged at top speed burst through and headed down the
street running like a deer

Yells went up a revolver spat venomously behind him came the shrill
CHEEPCHEEP of the police whistle and heavy boots pounding the
pavement in pursuit

Down the block Jimmie Dale raced The yells augmented in his rear
Another shotand this time he heard the bullet buzz And then he
swervedinto the next alleywaythat flanked the Sanctuary

He had perhaps a ten yards lead just a little more than the distance
from the street to the side door of the Sanctuary that opened on
the alleyway And as he ran now his fingers tore at his clothing
loosening his tie unbuttoning coat vest collar shirt and
undershirt He leaped at the door swung it open flung himself
insideand then sacrificing speed to silence went up the stairs like a
cat cramming his mask now into his pocket

His room was on the first landing In an instant he had unlocked the
door entered and locked it again behind him From outside an excited
street urchins voice shrilled up to him

He went in that door I seen him

The police whistle chirped again and then an authoritative voice

Get around and watch the saloon back of this Heeneytheres a way out
through there from this joint

Jimmie Dale divested of every stitch of clothing that he had worn
pulled a disreputable collarless flannel shirt over his head pulled on
a dirty and patched pair of trousers and slipped into a threadbare and
filthy coat Jimmie Dale was working against seconds They were at the
lower door now He lifted the oilcloth in the corner of the room
lifted up the loose piece of the flooring shoved his discarded garments
inside and from a little box that was there smeared the hollow of
his hand with some black substance possessed himself of two little
articles replaced the flooring replaced the oilcloth and in bare
feet stole across the room to the door Against the door without a
sound Jimmie Dale placed a chair and on the chair seat he laid the two
little articles he had been carrying in his hand It was intensely black
in the room but Jimmie Dale needed no light here From under the bed he
pulled out a pair of woolen socks and a pair of congress boots both as
disreputable as the rest of his attire put them onand very quietly
softly cautiously stretched himself out on the bed

The officers were at the top of the stairs A voice barked out

Stand guard on this landing Peters Higgins you take the one above
Well start from the top of the house and work down Allow no one to
pass you

Yes sir Very good Mr Kline was the response

Klinethe sharpest man in the United States secret service she had
said Jimmie Dales lips set

Im glad I had no shave this morning said Jimmie Dale grimly to
himself

His fingers were working with the black substance in the hollow of his
handand the long slim tapering fingers the shapely wellcaredfor
hands grew unkempt and grimy black beneath the finger nailsand a
little too played its part on the days growth of beard a little
around the throat and at the nape of the neck a little across the
forehead to meet the locks of straggling and disordered hair Jimmie
Dale wiped the residue from the hollow of his hand on the knee of his
trousersand lay still

An officer paced outside Upstairs doors opened and closed Gruff harsh
tones in commands echoed through the house The search party descended
to the second floorand again the same sounds were repeated And then
thumping down the creaking stairs they stopped before Jimmie Dales
room Some one tried the door and finding it locked rattled it
violently

Open the door It was Klines voice

Jimmie Dales eyes were closed and he was breathing regularly though
just a little slower than in natural respiration

Break it down ordered Kline tersely

There was a rush at itand it gave It surged inward knocked against
the chair upset the latter something tinkled to the floorand four
officers with Kline at their head jumped into the room

Jimmie Dale never moved A flashlight played around the room and focused
upon himand then he was shaken roughlyonly to fall inertly back on
the bed again

I guess this is all right Mr Kline said one of the officers Its
Larry the Bat and hes doped to the eyes Theres the stuff on the
floor we knocked off the chair

Light the gas directed Kline curtly and being obeyed stooped to
the floor and picked up a hypodermic syringe and a small bottle He held
the bottle to the light and read the label LIQUOR MORPHINAE Shake
him again he commanded

None too gently a policeman caught Jimmie Dale by the shoulder and
shook him vigorouslyagain Jimmie Dale once the other let go his hold
fell back limply on the bed breathing in that same slightly slowed
way

Larry the Bat eh grunted Kline then to the officer who had
volunteered the information Whos Larry the Bat What is he And how
long have you known him

I dont know who he is any more than what you can see there for
yourself replied the officer Hes a dope fiend and I guess a pretty
tough case though weve never had him up for anything Hes lived here
ever since Ive been on the beat and thats three years or

All right interrupted Kline crisply Hes no good to us You say
theres an exit from this house into that saloon at the back

Yes sir but the fellow whoever he is couldnt get away from there
Heeneys been over on guard from the start

Then hes still inside there said Kline clipping off his words
Well search the saloon Nice nights work this is One out of the
whole gangand that one with the compliments of the Gray Seal

The men went out and began to descend the stairs

One said Jimmie Dale to himself still motionless still breathing in
that slow way so characteristic of the drug Two Three Four

The minutes went bya quarter of an houra half hour Still Jimmie
Dale lay therestill motionlessstill breathing with slow regularity
His muscles began to cramp to give him exquisite torture Around
him all was silenceonly distant sounds from the street reached
him muffled and at intervals Another quarter of an hour passedan
eternity of torment It seemed to Jimmie Dale for all his will power
that he could not hold himself in check that he must move scream out
even in the torture that was passing all endurance It was silent now
utterly silentand then out of the silence just outside his door a
footstep creakedand a man walked to the stairs and went down

Five said Jimmie Dale to himself The sharpest man in the United
States secret service

And then for the first time Jimmie Dale movedto wipe away the beads of
sweat that had sprung out upon his forehead



CHAPTER V

THE AFFAIR OF THE PUSHCART MAN


Larry the Bat shambled out of the side door of the tenement into the
back alleyway shambled along the black alleyway to the streetand
smiled a little grimly as a shadow across the roadway suddenly shifted
its position The game was growing acute critical desperate evenand
it was his move

Larry the Bat disreputable denizen of the underworld alias Jimmie
Dale millionaires clubman alias the Gray Seal whom Carruthers of the
MORNING NEWSARGUS called the master criminal of the age shuffled along
in the direction of the Bowery his hands plunged deep in the pockets
of his frayed and tattered trousers where his fingers in a curious
wistful way fondled the keys of his own magnificent residence on
Riverside Drive It was his moveand it was an impasse ironical
sardonic and it was worseit was full of peril

True he had outwitted Kline of the secret service two nights before
when Kline had raided the counterfeiters den true he had no reason to
believe that Kline suspected HIM specifically but the man Kline wanted
HAD entered the tenement that night and since then the house had been
shadowed day and night The result was both simple and disastrousto
Jimmie Dale Larry the Bat a known inmate of the house might come
and go as he pleasedbut to emerge from the Sanctuary in the person of
Jimmie Dale would be fatal Kline had been outwitted but Kline had not
acknowledged final defeat The tenement had been searched from top to
bottomunostentatiously His own room on the first landing had been
searched the previous afternoon when he was out but they had failed to
find the cunningly contrived opening in the floor under the oilcloth in
the corner an impromptu wardrobe that would proclaim Larry the Bat and
Jimmie Dale to be one and the same personthat would inevitably lead
further to the establishment of his identity as the Gray Seal In time
of course the surveillance would ceasebut he could not wait That was
the monumental irony of itthe factor that all unknown to Kline was
forcing the issue hard now It was his move

Since years ago now as the Gray Seal he had begun to work with HER
that unknown mysterious accomplice of his and the police stung to
madness both by the virulent and constant attacks of the press and by
the humiliating prod of their own failures sought daily high and low
with every resource at their command for the Gray Seal he had never
been in quite so strange and perilous a plight as he found himself at
that moment To preserve inviolate the identity of Larry the Bat was
absolutely vital to his safety It was the one secret that even she who
so strangely appeared to know all else about him he was sure had not
discoveredand it was just that in a way that had brought the present
impossible situation to pass

In the month previous in a lull between those letters of hers he had
set himself doggedly and determinedly to the renewed task of what had
become so dominantly now a part of his very existencethe solving of
HER identity And for that month as the best means to the endmeans
however that only resulted as futilely as the attempts that had gone
beforehe had lived mostly as Larry the Bat returning to his home in
his proper person only when occasion and necessity demanded it He had
been going home that evening two nights before walking along Riverside
Drive when from the window of the limousine she had dropped the letter
at his feet that had plunged him into the affair of the Counterfeit
Fiveand he had not gone home Eventually to save himself he had in
the Sanctuary performing the transformation in desperate haste again
been forced to assume the role of Larry the Bat

That was really the gist of it And yesterday morning he had remembered
to his dismay that he had had little or no money left the night before
He had intended of course to replenish his supplywhen he got home
Only he hadnt gone home And now he needed moneyneeded it badly
desperately With thousands in the bank with abundance even in
his safe in his own den at home a supply kept there always for an
emergency he was facing actual wanthe rattled two dimes a nickel
and a few odd pennies thoughtfully against the keys in his pocket

To a certain extent old Jason his butler could be trusted Jason even
knew that mysterious letters of tremendous secretive importance came
to the house and the old man always meant wellbut he dared not trust
even Jason with the secret of his dual personality What was he to do
He needed money imperativelyat once Thanks to Kline for the time
being at least he could not rid himself of the personality of Larry
the Bat by the simple expedient or slipping into the clothes of Jimmie
Dalehe must live act and remain Larry the Bat until the secret
service officer gave up the hunt How bridge the gulf between Jimmie
Dale and Larry the Bat in old Jasons eyes

Nor was that all There was still another matter and one that in order
to counteract it demanded at once a serious inroadto the extent of
a telephone callupon his slender capital A too prolonged and
unaccountedfor absence from home and old Jason in his anxious
blundering solicitude would have the fat in the fire at that endand
the city and the social firmament thereof would be humming with the
startling news of the disappearance of a wellknown millionaire The
complications that would then ensue with himself powerless to lift a
finger Jimmie Dale did not care to think aboutsuch a contretemps must
at all hazards be prevented

Jimmie Dale reached the corner of the street where it intersected
the Bowery and paused languidly by the curb No one appeared to be
following He had not expected that there would bebut it was as well
to be sure He walked then a few steps along the Boweryand slipped
suddenly into a doorway from where he could command a view of the
street corner that he had just left At the end of ten minutes
satisfied that no one had any concern in his immediate movements he
shambled on again down the Bowery

There was a saloon two blocks away that boasted a private telephone
booth Jimmie Dale made that his destination

Larry the Bat was a very wellknown character in that resort and the
bulletheaded dispenser of drinks behind the bar nodded unctuously to
him over the heads of those clustered at the rail as he entered Larry
the Bat as befitted one of the elite of the underworld was graciously
pleased to acknowledge the proletariat salutation with a curt nod He
walked down to the end of the room entered the telephone boothand was
carelessly careful to close the door tightly behind him

He gave the number of his residence on Riverside Drive and waited for
the connection After some delay Jasons voice answered him

Jason said Jimmie Dale in matteroffact tones I shall be out
of the city for another three or four days possibly a week and he
stopped abruptly as a sort of gasp came to him over the wire

Thank God thats you sir exclaimed the old butler wildly Ive been
near mad sir all day

Dont get excited Jason said Jimmie Dale a little sharply The mere
matter of my absence for the last two days is nothing to cause you any
concern And while I am on the subject Jason let me say now that I
shall be glad if you will bear that fact in mind in future

Yes sir stammered Jason But sir it aint thatgood Lord Master
Jim it aint that sir Itsits one of them letters

Something like a galvanic shock seemed to jerk the disreputable
loosejointed frame of Larry the Bat suddenly erectand a strained
whiteness crept over the dirty unwashed face

Go on Jason said Jimmie Dale without a quiver in his voice

It came this morning sirthat shuffer with his automobile left it
I had just time to say you werent at home sir and he was gone And
then sir there aint been an hour gone by all through the day that a
woman sira lady begging your pardon Master Jimhasnt rung up
on the telephone asking if you were back and if I could get you and
where you were and half frantic sir half sobbing sometimes sir and
saying there was a life hanging on it Master Jim

Larry the Bat staring into the mouthpiece of the instrument
subconsciously passed his hand across his forehead and subconsciously
noted that his fingers as he drew them away were damp

Where is the letter now Jason inquired Jimmie Dale coolly

Here on your desk Master Jim Shall I bring it to you

Bring it to him How When Where Bring it to him The ghastly irony
of it Jimmie Dale tried to thinkprodding spurring desperately that
keen lightning brain of his that had never failed him yet How bridge
the gulf between Larry the Bat and Jimmie Dale in Jasons eyesnot just
for the replenishing of funds now but with a life at stake

NoI think not Jason said Jimmie Dale calmly Just leave it where
it is And if she telephones again say that you have told methat will
be sufficient to satisfy any further inquiries And Jason

Yes sir

If she telephones again try and find out where the call comes from

I havent forgotten what you said once Master Jim sir said the old
man eagerly And Ive been trying that sir all day Theyve all come
from different pay stations sir

A mirthless little smile tinged Jimmie Dales lips Of course He might
have known It was always that way always the same He was as near to
the solution of her identity at that moment as he had been years ago
when she in some mysterious way alone of all the world had identified
him as the Gray Seal

Very good Jason he said quietly Dont bother about it any more
It will be all right You can expect me when you see me Goodnight He
hung the receiver on the hook walked out of the booth and mechanically
reached the street

All right It was far from all rightvery far from it It was no
trivial thing that letter they never had been trivial things those
letters of hers that involved so often a matter of life and deathas
this one now perhaps as her actions would seem to indicate involved
life and death more urgently than any that had gone before It was far
from all rightat a moment when his own position his own safety was
at best but a desperate chance when his every energy brain wit and
cunning were taxed to the utmost to save himself And yet somehow some
way at any cost he must get that letterand at any cost he must act
upon it To fail her was to fail utterly in everything that failure in
its most miserable its widest sense impliedfailure in that which
rose paramount to every other consideration in life

Fail her Jimmie Dales lips thinned into a hard drawn lineand then
parted slowly in a curiously whimsical smile It would be a strange
burglary that he had decided upon in order that he might not fail
herstranger than any the Gray Seal had ever committed and in some
respects even more perilous

He started along the Bowery walking briskly now toward the nearest
subway station at Astor Place his mind for the moment electing to face
the situation in a humour as whimsical as his smile Supposing that
as Larry the Bat he were caught and arrested during the next hour in
Jimmies Dales residence on Riverside Drive With his arrest as Larry
the Bat Jimmies Dale would automatically disappear Would follow then
the suspicion that Jimmie Dale the millionaire had met with foul play
and as time went on and Jimmie Dale being then in prison as Larry
the Bat did not reappear the assurance of it then the certainty
that suspicion would focus on Larry the Bat as being connected with
the millionaires death since Larry the Bat had been caught in Jimmie
Dales homeand he would be accused of his own murder It was quite
humourous of course quite grotesquely bizarrebut it was equally
an exceedingly grim possibility There were drawbacks to a dual
personality

In a word confided Jimmie Dale softly to himself and a serious light
crept into the dark steady eyes Im in a bit of a nasty mess

At Astor Place he entered the subway at Fourteenth Street he changed
to an express and at Ninetysixth Street he got out It was but a short
walk west to Riverside Drive and from there his house was only a few
blocks farther on

Jimmie Dale did not slouch now And for all his disreputable attire
incongruous as it was in that neighbourhood few people that he
passed paid any attention to him none gave him more than a casual
glanceJimmie Dale swung along upright with no attempt to make
himself inconspicuous hurrying a little as one intent upon a definite
errand As he neared his house he slowed his pace a little until a
couple who were passing in front of it had gone on then he went up
the steps but noiselessly as a shadow now to the front door opened
it softly closed it softly behind him and crouched for a moment in the
vestibule

Through the monogrammed lace on the plate glass of the inner doors he
could see a little indistinctly into the reception hall beyond The
hall was empty Jason for that matter would be the only one likely to
be about the other servants would have no business there in any case
and whether in their quarters above or below they had their own stairs
at the rear

Jimmie Dale inserted the key in the spring lock and opened the door
a cautious fraction of an inchto listen There was no soundyes
a subdued murmuredthe servants were downstairs in the basement He
slipped inside slipped in a flash across the hall and treading like
a cat went up the stairs He scarcely seemed to breathe until with a
little sigh of relief he stood inside his den on the first floor with
the door shut behind him

I must speak to Jason about being a little more watchful muttered
Jimmie Dale facetiously Heres all my property at the mercy ofLarry
the Bat

An instant he stood by the door looking about himin the bright
moonlight streaming in through the side windows the rooms appointments
stood out in soft shadows the huge davenport the great luxurious
easychairs an easel with a halffinished canvas as he had left it
the big flattopped rosewood desk the open fireplaceand then his
steps silent on the thick velvet rug under foot he walked quickly to
the desk

Yes there it wasthe letter He placed it hurriedly in his pocketthe
moonlight was not strong enough to read by and he dared not turn on the
lights

And now moneyfunds In the alcove behind the portiere Jimmie Dale
dropped on his knees before the squat barrelshaped safe and opened
it He reached inside took out a package of banknotes placed the bills
in his pocketand hesitated a moment What else would he require What
act did that letter call upon the Gray Seal to perform in the next few
hours Jimmie Dale stared thoughtfully into the interior of the safe
Whatever it was it must be performed in the role of Larry the Bat for
though he could get into his dressing room now and become Jimmie Dale
again there were still those watchers outside the SanctuaryTHEY must
not become suspiciousand if Larry the Bat disappeared mysteriously
Larry the Bat would be the man that Kline and the secret service of the
United States would never cease hunting for and that would mean that
he could never reassume a character that was as necessary for his
protection as breath was to life so long as the Gray Seal worked True
he could change now to Jimmie Dale but he would have to change back
again and return to the Sanctuary before morning as Larry the Batand
remain there until Kline beaten called off his human bloodhounds No
a change was not to be thought of

What then would he requirethat compact little kit of burglar tools
rolled in its leather jacket that unrolled slipped about his body like
a closefitting undervest As well to take it anyway He removed his
coat and vest took out the leather bundle from the safe untied the
thongs that bound it together unrolled it passed it around his body
life belt fashion secured the thongs over his shoulders and put on
his coat and vest again A revolver a flashlight He had bothat
the Sanctuary under the flooringbut there were duplicates here He
slipped them into his pockets Anything elseto forestall and provide
for any possible contingency He hesitated again for a moment thinking
then slowly closed the inner door of the safe locked it swung the
outer door shutand in the act of twirling the knobs sprang suddenly
to his feet Sharp shrill in the stillness of the room the telephone
bell on the desk rang out clamourously

Jimmie Dales face set hard as he leaped out from behind the
curtainhad Jason heard it It rang again before he could reach the
deskwas ringing as he snatched the receiver from the hook

Yes yes he called in a low guarded hasty way into the
mouthpiece Hello What is it And then one hand resting on the desk
closed around the edge and tightened until the skin over the knuckles
grew ivory white It wasSHE She It was HER voicehe had only heard
it once in all his lifethat night two nights before in a silvery
laugh from the limousine as it had sped away from him down the roadbut
he knew It thrilled him now with a mad rhapsody robbing him for the
moment of every thought save that she was living real existentthat
it was HER voice Its youYOU he said hoarsely

Oh Jimmieyou at lastit came in a little gasping cry of relief
The letter

Yes Ive got itits all rightits all rightthe words would
not seem to come fast enough in his desperate haste But its you now
Listen Listen he pleaded Tell me who you are My God how Ive
tried to find you and

That rippling silvery laugh again but now too it seemed to his eager
ear with just the faintest note of wistfulness in it

Some day Jimmie That letter now It

Jimmie Dale straightened up suddenlyJasons steps running sounded
outside the room along the corridorthere was not an instant to lose

Hang up Goodbye Danger Dont ring again he whispered hurriedly
and with a miserable smile replacing the receiver bitterly on the
hook he jumped for the curtain

He reached it none too soon The door opened an electriclight switch
clicked and the room was flooded with light Jason still running
headed for the desk

Itll be her again Jimmie Dale heard the old man mutter as from the
edge of the portiere he watched the others actions

Jason picked up the telephone

Hello Hello he calledthen began to click impatiently with the
receiver hook Hello    Who    Central    I dont want
any numbersomebody was calling here    What    Nobody on the
wire

He set the telephone back on the desk with a bewildered air

Thats queer he exclaimed I could have sworn I heard it ring twice
and He stopped abruptly and leaning across the desk hung there
wideeyed staring while a sickly pallor began to steal into his face
The letter he mumbled wildly The letterMaster Jims letterthe
letterits GONE

Trembling excited the old man began to search the desk then down on
his knees on the floor under it and then growing more frantic with
every instant rose and began to hunt around the room in an agitated
aimless fashion

Jasons distress was very realhe was almost beside himself now with
fear and anxiety A whimsical affectionate smile played over Jimmie
Dales lips at the old mans anticsand changed suddenly into one of
consternation Jason was making directly now for the curtain behind
which he stood Perhaps though he would pass it by andJasons hand
reached out and grasped the portiere

Jason said Jimmie Dale sharply

The old man staggered back as though he had been struck tried to speak
choked and gazed at the curtain with distended eyes

Isis that you sirMaster Jimbehind the curtain there he finally
blurted out Isiryou gave me a startand the letter Master Jim

Dont lose your head Jason said Jimmie Dale coolly Ive got the
letter Now do as I bid you

YesMaster Jim faltered the old man

Pull down the window shades and draw the portiere together directed
Jimmie Dale

Jason still overwrought and excited obeyed a little awkwardly

Now the lights Jason instructed Jimmie Dale Turn them off and go
and sit down in that chair at the desk

Again Jason obeyed stumbling in the darkness as he returned from the
electriclight switch at the farther end of the room He sat down in the
chair

Larry the Bat stepped out from behind the curtain I came for that
letter Jason he explained quietly I am going out again now I may
be back tomorrow I may not be back for a week You will say nothing
not a word of my having been here tonight Do you understand Jason

Yes sir said Jason then hesitantly Would you mind saying sir
when you came in

Its of no consequence Jasonis it

No sir said Jason

Jimmie Dale smiled in the darkness

Jason

Yes sir

I wish you to remain where you are without leaving that chair for the
next ten minutes He moved across the room to the door Goodnight
Jason he said

Goodnight Master Jimgoodnight siroh Lord

Jimmie Dale did not require that ten minutes it was a very wide margin
of safety to obviate the possibility of Jason from a window detecting
the exit of a disreputable character from the housein three minutes
he was turning the corner of the first cross street and walking rapidly
away from Riverside Drive

In the subway station Jimmie Dale read the letterread it twice over
as he always read those strange epistles of hers that opened the door to
new peril new danger to the Gray Seal but too that seemed somehow to
draw tighter in a glad big way the unseen bond between them read it
as he always read those letters almost subconsciously committing the
very words to memory with that keen faculty of brain of his But now
as he began to tear the sheet and envelope into minute particles a
strained hard look was on his face and in his eyes and his lips half
parted moved a little

Its a death warrant muttered Jimmie Dale II guess tonight will
see the end of the Gray Seal She says I neednt do it but I guess its
worth the riska human life

A downtown express roared into the station

What time is it Jimmie Dale asked the guard as he stepped aboard

Bout midnight the man answered tersely

The forward car was almost empty and Jimmie Dale chose a seat by
himself How did she know How did she know not only this but the
hundred other affairs that she had outlined in those letters of hers By
what means superhuman indeed it seemed did sheJimmie Dale jerked
himself erect suddenly What good did it do to speculate on that now
when every minute was priceless What was HE to do how was he to act
what plan could he formulate and carry out and WIN against odds that
at the outset were desperate enough even to forecast almost certain
failureand death

Who would ever have suspected old Tom Ludgate known for years
throughout the squalour of the East Side as old Luddy the pushcart man
of having a bag of unset diamonds under his pillowor under the sack
rather that he probably used for a pillow What a queer thing to do
But then old Luddy was a characterapparently always in the most
povertystricken condition apparently hardly more than keeping body
and soul together trusting no one and obsessed by the dread that by
depositing in a bank some one would discover that he had money and
attempt to force it from him he had put his savings year after
year for twenty years twentyfive years perhaps into unset
stonediamonds How had she found that out

Jimmie Dale sank into a deeper reverie He could steal them all right
and they would be well worth the stealingold Luddy had done well and
lived and existed on next to nothingthe stones she said were worth
about fifteen thousand dollars Not so bad even for twentyfive years
of vegetable selling from a pushcart He could steal them all right it
would tax the Gray Seals ingenuity little to do so simple a thing as
that but that was not all nor indeed hardly a factor in itit was
vital that if he were to succeed at all he must steal them PUBLICLY as
it were

And after thatWHAT His own chances were pretty slim at best Jimmie
Dale staring at the grayness of the subway wall through the window
shook his head slowlythen with a queer little philosophical shrug of
his shoulders he smiled gravely seriously It was all a part of the
game all a part of the lifeof the Gray Seal

It was halfpast twelve or a little later as nearly as he could judge
for Larry the Bat carried no such ornate thing in evidence as a watch
as he halted at the corner of a dark squalid street in the lower
East Side It was a miserable localityin daylight humming with a
cosmopolitan hive of pitiful humans dragging out as best they could
an intolerable existence a locality peopled with every nationality on
earth their community of interest the struggle to maintain life at the
lowest possible expenditure where necessity even was pared and
shaved down to a minimum but now at night time or rather in the
earlymorning hours the darkness in very mercy it seemed covered it
with a veil as it were and in the quiet that hung over it now hid the
bald the hideous aye and the piteous too from view

It was a narrow street and the row of tenement houses each house
almost identical with its neighbour that flanked the pavement on either
side seemed from where Jimmie Dale stood looking down its length from
the corner to converge together at a point a little way beyond
giving it an unreal ominous cavernlike effect And too there seemed
something ominous even in its quiet It was as though one sensed acutely
the crouching of some Thing in its lairwaiting silently viciously
with sullen patience

A footstep soundedanother Jimmie Dale drew quickly back around the
corner into an areaway Two men passedin helmetsswinging their
nightsticksthat beat was always policed in pairs

They passed on turned the corner and went down the narrow cross street
that Jimmie Dale had just been inspecting He started to followand
drew back again abruptly A form flitted suddenly across the road and
disappeared in the darkness in the officers waketen yards behind
the first another followedat the same interval of distance still
anotherand yet still one morefour in all

The darkness hid all six the two policemen the four men behind
themthe only sounds were the OFFICERS footsteps dying away in the
distance

Jimmie Dales fingers were mechanically testing the mechanism of the
automatic in his pocket

The Skeeters gang he muttered to himself Red Mose the Midget
Harve Thomsand the Skeeter The Worst apaches in the city of New York
death contractorsthe lowest bidders Professional assassins and a
mans life any time for twentyfive dollars I wonderIve never
done it yetbut I wonder if it would be a crime in Gods sight if one
shotto KILL

Jimmie Dale was at the corner againagain the street before him was
black deserted empty He chose the right hand side and well in the
shadow of the houses as an extra precaution stole along silently He
stopped finally before one where in the doorway hung a little sign
Jimmie Dale mounted the porch and with his eyes close to the sign could
just make out the larger words in the big printed type


ROOM TO RENT

TOP FLOOR


Jimmie Dale nodded That was right The first house on the righthand
side with the roomtorent sign her letter had said His fingers were
testing the doorknob The door was not locked

Naturally it wouldnt be locked Jimmie Dale told himself grimlyand
stepped inside

He stood for an instant without movement every faculty on the alert
Far up above him a step guarded though his trained ear made it out
to be creaked faintly upon the stairsthere was no other sound The
creaking almost inaudible at its loudest receded farther upand
silence fell

In the darkness noiselessly Jimmie Dale groped for the stairway found
it and began to ascend The minutes passedit seemed a minute even
from step to step and there were three flights to the top There must
be no creaking this timethe slightest sound he knew well enough
would be not only fatal to the work he had to do but probably fatal to
himself as well He had been near death many timesthe consciousness
that he was nearer to it now possibly than he had ever been before
seemed to stimulate his senses into acute and abnormal energy And too
the physical effort as step by step the flexed muscles relaxing so
slowly little by little gradually each time as he found foothold
on the step higher up was a terrific strain At the top his face was
bathed in perspiration and he wiped it off with his coat sleeve

It was still dark here intensely dark and his eyes though grown
accustomed to it could make out nothing but the deeper shadow of the
walls But thanks to her always a mistress of accurate and minute
detail he possessed a mental plan of his surroundings The head of the
stairs gave on the middle of the hallwaythe hallway ran to his right
and left To his right on the opposite side of the hall was the door
of old Luddys squalid tworoom apartment

For a moment Jimmie Dale stood hesitanta sudden perplexity and anxiety
growing upon him It was strange What did it mean He had nerved
himself to a quick desperate attempt trusting to surprise and his own
wit and agility for victorythere had seemed no other way than that
since he had seen those four men at the cornersince they were AHEAD
of him True they were not much ahead of him not enough to have
accomplished their purposeand furthermore they were not in that
room He knew that absolutely beyond question of doubt He had listened
for just that all the nerveracking way up the stairs But where
were they There was no soundnot a soundjust blackness dark
impenetrable utter that began to palpitate now

It came in a whisper wavering sibilantfrom his left A sort of
relief fierce in the breaking of the tense expectancy premonitory in
the possibilities that it held swept Jimmie Dale He crept along the
hall The whisper had come from that room presumably emptythat was
for rent

By the door he crouchedhis sensitive fingers eyes to Jimmie Dale so
oftenfeeling over jamb and panels with a delicate soundless touch
The door was just ajar The fingers crept inside and touched the knob
and lockthere was no key within

The whispering still went onbut it seemed like a screaming of vultures
now in Jimmie Dales ears as the words came to him

Aw say Skeeter dis highbrow stunt gives me de pip Me fer goin in
dere an croakin de geezer reglar widout de frills Whos to know
Say just about two minutes an were beatin it wid de sparklers

An inch a half inch at a time the knob slowly very very slowly
turning the door was being closed by the crouched form on the
threshold

Close yer trap Mose came a fierce response We aint fixed the
lay all day for nothin There aint a soul on earth knows hes got any
sparklers cept us If there was it would be differentthen theyd
know that was what whoever did it was after see

The door was closedthe knob slowly very very slowly being released
again From one of the leather pockets under Jimmie Dales vest came a
tiny steel instrument that he inserted in the keyhole

The same voice spoke on

Thats what were croaking him for cause nobody knows about them
diamonds and sos he cant TELL anybody afterward that any were
pinched An thats why its got to look like he just got tired of
living and did it himself I guess thatll hold the police when they
find the poor old duck hanging from the ceiling with a bit of cord
around his neck and a chair kicked out from under his feet on the
floor Aint you got the brains of a louse to see that

Surethe whisper came dully in grudging intonation through the
panelsthe door was locked Sure but its de hangin round waitin
to get busy thats gettin me goat an

Jimmie Dale straightened up and began to retreat along the corridor
A merciless rage was upon him now every fiber of his being seemed to
tingle and quiver with itthe damnable hellish ingenuity of it all
seemed to choke and suffocate him

Luck muttered Jimmie Dale between his clenched teeth Oh the
blessed luck to get that door locked Ive got time now to set the stage
for my own getaway before the showdown

He stole on along the corridor Excerpts from her letter were running
through his brain It would do no good to warn him Jimmiethe Skeeter
and his gang would never let up on him until they got the stones   
It would do no good for you to steal them first for they would only
take that as a ruse of old Luddys and murder the man first and hunt
afterward    In some way you must let the Skeeter SEE you steal
them make them think make them certain that it is a bonafide theft
so that they will no longer have any interest or any desire to do old
Luddy harm    And for it to appear real to them it must appear real
to old Luddy himselfdo not take any chances there

Jimmie Dales eyes narrowed Yes it was simple enough now with that
pack of hells wolves guarded for the moment by a locked door forced to
give him warning by breaking the door before they could get out It was
simple enough now to enter old Luddys room steal the stones at the
revolver point then make enough disturbancewhen he was readyto set
the gang in motion and as they rushed in open him to make his escape
with the stones to the roof through Luddys room That was simple
enoughthere was an opening to the roof in Luddys room she had said
and there was a ladder kept there in place On hot nights it seemed
the old man used to go up there and sleep on the roofnot now of
course It was too late in the year for thatbut the opening in the
roof was there and the ladder remained there too

Yes it was simple enough now And the next morning the papers would
rave with execrations against the Gray Sealfor the robbery of the
life savings of a poor defenseless old man for committing as vile and
pitiful a crime as had ever stirred New York Even Carruthers of
the MORNING NEWSARGUS would be moved to bitter attack Good old
Carrutherswho little thought that the Gray Seal was his old college
pal his present most intimate friend Jimmie Dale And afterwardafter
the next morning Well that at least had never been in doubt Old
Luddy could be made to leave New York and once away with the Skeeter
and his gang robbed of incentive to pay any further attention to him
the stones could be secretly returned to the old man And it would
to the public to the police be just another of the Gray Seals
crimesthat was all

Jimmie Dale had reached old Luddys door The Gray Seal Oh yes they
would know it was the Gray Sealthe insignia was familiar enough
familiar to the crooks of the underworld who held it in awe familiar
to the police to whom it was an added barb of ridicule He was placing
it now that insignia a diamondshaped gray paper seal on the panel
of the door and now a black silk mask adjusted over his face Jimmie
Dale bent to insert the little steel instrument in the locka pitiful
paltry thing a cheap lock to fingers that could play so intimately
with twirling knobs and dials masters of the intricate mechanism of
vaults and safes

And then about to open the door a sort of sudden dismay fell upon him
He had not thought of thatsomehow it had not occurred to him WHAT
WAS IT THEY WERE WAITING FOR Why had they not struck at once as when
he had first entered the house he had supposed they would do What was
it Why was it Was old Luddy out Were they waiting for his returnor
what

The door without sound moved gradually under his hand A faint odor
assailed his nostrils It was dark very dark Across the room in a
direct line was the doorway of the inner roomshe had explained that
in her letter It was slow progress to cross that room without sound
in silenceit was a snails movementfor fear that even a muscle might
crack

And now he stood in the inner doorway It was dark here toand yet
how bizarre a star seemed to twinkle through the very roof of the room
itself The odour was pungent now There was a longdrawn sighthen a
low indescribable sound of movement SOMEBODY APART FROM OLD LUDDY
WAS IN THE ROOM

It swept the full consciousness of it upon Jimmie Dale in an
instantaneous flash Chloroform the open scuttle in the roof the
waiting of those othersall fused into a compact logical whole They
had loosened the scuttle during the day probably when old Luddy was
awayone of them had crept down there now to chloroform the old man
into insensibilitythe others would complete the ghastly work presently
by stringing their victim up to the ceilingand it would be suicide
for long before morning came long before the old man would be
discovered the fumes of the chloroform would be gone

It seemed like a cold hand deathlike clutching at his heart Was he
too late after all Chloroform alone couldkill To the right just a
little to the righthe must make no mistakehis ear placed the sound
He whipped his hands from the side pockets of his coatthe ray of his
flashlight cut across the room and fell upon an aged face upon a bed
upon a hand clutching a wad of cloth the cloth pressed horribly against
the nose and mouth of the upturned faceand then roaring in the
stillness spitting a vicious lane of fire that paralleled the
flashlights ray came the tongue flame of his automatic

There was a yell a scream that echoed out reverberated and went
racketing through the house and Jimmie Dale leaped forwardover a
table sending it crashing to the floor The man had reeled back against
the wall clutching at a shattered wrist staring into the flashlights
eye whitefaced jaw dropped lips working in mingled pain and fear

Harve Thomsyou eh gritted Jimmie Dale

A cunning look swept the distorted face Here apparently was only one
manthere were pals three of them only a few yards away

You aint got nothing on me he snarled sparring for time You
police are too damned fresh with your guns

Ill take yours snapped Jimmie Dale and snatched it deftly from the
others pocket This aint any police job my bucko and you make
a move and Ill drop you for keeps if what youve got already aint
enough to teach you to keep your hands off jobs that belong to your
betters

He was working with mad haste as he spoke One minute at the outside
was perhaps all he could count upon Already he had caught the rattle
of the locked door down the hall He lit a match and turned on the gas
over the bedit was the most dangerous thing he could dohe knew that
well enough none knew it betterit was offering himself as a fair
mark when the others rushed in as they would in a moment nowbut the
Skeeter and his gang and this man here must have no misconception of his
purpose his reason for being there the same as their own the theft of
the stonesand no misconception as to his SUCCESS

Yaint the policeit came in a choked gasp from the other as he
blinked in the sudden light Say then

Shut up ordered Jimmie Dale curtly And mind what I told you about
moving He leaned over the bed Old Luddy though under the influence
of the chloroform was moving restlessly Thoms had evidently only begun
to apply the chloroformold Luddy was safe Jimmie Dale ran his hand
in under the pillow If you aint swiped them already they ought to be
here he growled and if you have Illah A little chamois bag was
in his hand He laughed sneeringly at Thoms opened the bag allowed
a few stones to trickle into his handand then without stopping to
replace them dashed stones and bag into his pocket The door along the
corridor crashed open

Whats that he gasped out in wellsimulated frightand sprang for
the ladder that led up to the roof

It had all taken perhaps the minute that he had counted onno more
Noises came from the floors below now a confusion of themthe shot
the scream had been heard by others save those who had been in the
locked room And the latter were outside now in the corridor running to
their accomplices aid

There was a pause at the outer doorthen an oathand coupled with the
oath an exclamation

The Gray Seal

They had swept a flashlight over the door panelJimmie Dale halfway up
the ladder smiled grimly

The door openedthere was a rush of feet The man with the shattered
wrist yelled cursing wildly

Here he ison the ladder Let him have it Fill him full of holes

Jimmie Dale was in the lightthey were in the dark of the outer room
He fired at the threshold checking their rushas a hail of bullets
chipped and tore at the ladder and spat wickedly against the wall He
swung through to the roof trying as he did so to kick the ladder
loose behind him It was fastened

The three gunmen jumped into the roomfrom the roof Jimmie Dale got a
glimpse of them below as he flung himself clear of the opening Bullets
whistled through the aperturea voice roared up as he gained his feet

Come on After him The whole place is alive but this lets us out
We can frame up how we came to be here easy enough Never mind the old
geezer there any more Get the Gray Sealthe reward thats out for him
is worth twice the sparklers and

Jimmie Dale hurled the cover over the scuttle He could have stood them
off from above and kept the ladder clear with his revolver but the
alarm seemed general nowwindows were opening voices were calling to
one anotherfrom the windows across the street he must stand out in
sharp outline against the sky Yeshe was seen now

A womans voice from a topstory window across the street screamed
out highpitched in excitement

There he is There he is On the roof there

Jimmie Dale started on the run along the roof The houses built wall to
wall flatroofed seemed to offer an open course ahead of himuntil
a lane or an intersecting street should bar his way But they were not
quite all on the same level thoughthe wall of the next house rose
suddenly breast high in front of him He flung himself up regained his
feetand ducked instantly behind a chimney

The crack of a revolver echoed through the nighta bullet drummed
through the airthe Skeeter and his gang were on the roof now dashing
forward firing as they ran Two shots from Jimmie Dales automatic in
quick succession cooled the ardour of their rushand they broke black
flitting forms for the shelter of chimneys too

And now the whole neighbourhood seemed awakened A dulltoned roar
as from some great gulf below rolled up from the street a medley of
slamming windows the rush of feet as people poured from the houses
cries shouts and yellsand high over all the shrill call of the
policepatrol whistleand the CRACK CRACK CRACK of the Skeeters
revolver shotsthe Skeeter and his hellhounds for once selfappointed
allies of the law

Twice again Jimmie Dale firedthen crouching running low he zigzagged
his way across the next roof The bullets followed himonce more his
pursuers dashed forward And again Jimmie Dale his face set like stone
now his breath coming in hard gasps dodged behind a chimney and with
his gun checked their rush for the third time

He glanced about himand with a growing sense of disaster saw that two
houses farther on the stretch of roof appeared to end There would be
a lane or a street there And in another minute or two if it were not
already the case others would be following the gunmen to the roof
and then he would behe caught his breath suddenly in a queer little
strangled cry of relief Just back of him a few yards away his eyes
made out what in the darkness seemed to be a glass skylight

A dark form sped like a deeper shadow across the black in front of
him making for a chimney nearer by closing in the range Jimmie Dale
firedwide Tight as was the corner he was in little as was the
mercy deserved at his hands he could not after all bring himself to
shootto kill

A voice the Skeeters bawled out raucously

Rush him all togetherfrom different sides at once

A backward leap Jimmie Dales boot was crashing glass and frame
stamping at it desperately making a hole for his body through the
skylight A yell a chorus of them answered thisthen the crunch of
racing feet on the gravel roof He emptied his revolver sweeping the
darkness with a semicircle of vicious flashes

It seemed an hourit was barely the fraction of a second as he hung
by his hands from the side of the skylight frame his body swinging
back and forth in the unknown blackness below The skylight might
be probably was directly over the stair well and open clear to the
basement of the housebut it was his only chance He swung his body
well out let goand dropped With the impetus he smashed against a
wall was flung back from it in a sort of rebound and his hands closed
gripping fiercely on banisters It had been the stair well beyond any
question of doubt but his swing had sent him clear of it

Above they had not yet reached the skylight Jimmie Dale snatched a
precious moment to listen as he rose and found himself apart from
bruises perhaps unhurt There was commotion too in this house below
the alarm had extended and spread along the blockbut the commotion was
all in the FRONT of the housethe street was the lure

Jimmie Dale started down the stairs and in an instant he had gained the
landing In another he had slipped to the rear of the hallsomewhere
there from the hall itself from one of the rear rooms there must be
an exit to the fire escape To attempt to leave by the front way was
certain capture

They were yelling shouting down now through the skylight above as
Jimmie Dale softly raised the window sash at the rear of the hall The
fire escape was there Shouts from along the corridor from the tenement
dwellers who had been crowding their neighbours rooms craning their
necks probably from the front windows answered the shouts now from the
roof and the skylight doors opened forms rushed outbut it was dark
in the corridor only a murky yellow at the upper end from the opened
doors

Jimmie Dale slipped through the window to the fire escape and working
cautiously silently but with the speed of a trained athlete made his
way down At the bottom he dropped from the iron platform into the back
yard ran for the fence and climbed over into a lane on the other side

And then as he ran Jimmie Dale snatched the mask from his face and
put it in his pocket He was safe now He swept the sweat drops from his
forehead with the back of his handnoticing them for the first time
It had been closealmost as close for him as it had been for old Luddy
And tomorrow the papers would execrate the Gray Seal He smiled a
little wanly His breath was still coming hard Presently they would
scour the lanewhen they found that their quarry was not in the house
What a racket they were making The whole district seemed roused like a
swarm of angry bees

He kept on along the laneand dodged suddenly into a cross street where
the two intersected The clang of a bell dinned discordantly in
his earsa patrol wagon swept by him racing for the scene of the
disturbancethe riot call was out

Again Jimmie Dale smiled wearily passing his hand across his eyes

I guess said Jimmie Dale Im pretty near all in And I guess its
time that Larry the Bat wenthome

And a little later a figure turned from the Bowery and shambled down
the cross street a disreputable figure with hands plunged deep in his
pocketsand a shadow across the roadway suddenly shifted its position
as the shambling figure slouched into the black alleyway and entered the
tenements side door

And Larry the Bat smiled softly to himselfKlines men were still on
guard



CHAPTER VI

DEVILS WORK


A whitegloved arm a voice and a silvery laugh Just thatno more
Jimmie Dale in his favourite seat an aisle seat some seven or eight
rows back from the orchestra stared at the stage to all outward
appearances absorbed in the last act of the play inwardly quite
oblivious to the fact that even a play was going on

A whitegloved arm a voice and a silvery laugh The words had formed
themselves into a sort of singsong refrain that for the last few days
had been running through his head A strange enough guiding star to
mould and dictate every action in his life And that was all he had ever
seen of her all that he had ever heard of herexcept those letters
of course each of which had outlined the details of some affair for the
Gray Seal to execute

Indeed it seemed a great length of time now since he had heard from her
even in that way though it was not so many days ago after all Perhaps
it was the calm as it were that by contrast had given place to the
strenuous months and weeks just past The storm raised by the newspapers
at the theft of Old Luddys diamonds had subsided into sporadic
diatribes aimed at the police Kline of the secret service had finally
admitted defeat and a shadow no longer skulked day and night at
the entrance to the Sanctuaryand Larry the Bat bore the government
indorsement so to speak of being no more suspicious a character than
that of a disreputable but harmless dope fiend of the underworld

Larry the Bat The Gray Seal Jimmie Dale the millionaire What if it
were ever known that that strange three were one What ifJimmie Dale
smiled whimsically A burst of applause echoed through the house the
orchestra was playing the lights were on seats banged there was the
bustle of the rising audience the play was at an endand for the life
of him he could not have remembered a single line of the last act

The aisle at his elbow was already crowded with people on their way out
Jimmie Dale stooped down mechanically to reach for his hat beneath his
seatand the next instant he was standing up staring wildly into the
faces around him

It had fallen at his feeta white envelope Hers It was in his hand
now those slim tapering wonderfully sensitive fingers of Jimmie
Dale that were an open sesame to locks and safes subconsciously
telegraphing to his mind the fact that the texture of the paperwas
hers Hers And she must be one of those around himone of those
crowding either the row of seats in front or behind or one of those
just passing in the aisle It had fallen at his feet as he had stooped
over for his hatbut from just exactly what direction he could not
tell His eyes eagerly hungrily critically swept face after face
Which one was hers What irony She whom he would have given his
life to know for whom indeed he risked his life every hour of the
twentyfour was close to him now within reachand as far removed as
though a thousand miles separated them She was therebut he could not
recognise a face that he had never seen

With an effort he choked back the bitter impotent laugh that rose to
his lips They were talking laughing around him Her VOICEyes he
had once heard that and that he would recognise again He strained to
catch to individualise the tone sounds that floated in a medley about
him It was uselessof courseevery effort that he had ever made
to find her had been useless She was too clever far too clever for
thatshe too would know that he could and would recognise her voice
where he could recognise nothing else

And then suddenly he realised that he was attracting attention Level
stares from the women returned his gaze and they edged away a little
from his vicinity as they passed their escorts crowding somewhat
belligerently into their places Others in the same row of seats as his
own were impatiently waiting to get by him With a muttered apology
Jimmie Dale raised the seat of his chair allowing these latter to pass
himand then slipping the letter into his pocketbook he snatched up
his hat from the seat rack

There was still a chance Knowing he was there she would be on her
guard but in the lobby among the crowd and unaware of his presence
there was the possibility that if he could reach the entrance ahead of
her she too might be talking and laughing as she left the theatre
Just a single word just a tonethat was all he asked

The row of seats at whose end he stood was empty now and instead of
stepping into the thronged aisle he made his way across to the opposite
side of the theatre Here the far aisle was less crowded and in a
minute he had gained the foyer confident that he was now in advance of
her The next moment he was lost in a jam of people in the lobby

He moved slowly now very slowlyallowing those behind to press by
him on the way to the entrance A babel of voices rose about him
as tightpacked the mass of people jostled elbowed and pushed
goodnaturedly It was a voice now her voice that he was listening
for but though it seemed that every faculty was strained and intent
upon that one effort his eyes too had in no degree relaxed their
vigilanceand once half grimly half sardonically he smiled to
himself There would be an unexpected aftermath to this exodus
of expensively gowned and bejewelled women with their prosperous
wellgroomed escorts There was the Wowzer over theresleek dapper
squirming in and out of the throng with the agility and stealth of a
cat As Larry the Bat he had met the Wowzer many times as indeed he
had met and was acquainted with most of the elite of the underworld
The Wowzer beyond a shadow of doubt in his own profession stood upon
a plane entirely by himselfamong those qualified to speak no one yet
had ever questioned the Wowzers claim to the distinction of being the
most dexterous and finished poke getter in the United States

The crowd thinned in the lobby thinned down to the last few belated
stragglers who passed him as he still loitered in the entrance and
then Jimmie Dale with a shrug of his shoulders that was a great
deal more philosophical than the maddening sense of chagrin and
disappointment that burned within him stepped out to the pavement and
headed down Broadway After all he had known it in his heart of hearts
all the timeit had always been the sameit was only one more occasion
added to the innumerable ones that had gone before in which she had
eluded him

And nowthere was the letter Automatically he quickened his steps a
little It was useless futile profitless for the moment at least to
disturb himself over his failurethere was the letter His lips parted
in a strange halfserious halfspeculative smile The letterthat
was paramount now What new venture did the night hold in store for
him What sudden emergency was the Gray Seal called upon to face this
timewhat role unrehearsed without warning must he play What story
of grim desperate rascality would the papers credit him with
when daylight came Or would they carry in screaming headlines the
announcement that the Gray Seal was caged and caught at last and in
threeinch type tell the world that the Gray Seal wasJimmie Dale

A block down he turned from Broadway out of the theatre crowds that
streamed in both directions past him The letter Almost feverishly
now he was seeking an opportunity to open and read it unobserved an
eagerness upon him that mingled exhilaration at the lure of danger
with a sense of premonition that irritably inevitably was with him
at moments such as these It seemed it always seemed that with an
unopened letter of hers in his possession it was as though he were
about to open a page in the Book of Fate and read as it were a
pronouncement upon himself that might mean life or death

He hurried on People still passed by himtoo many And then a cafe
just ahead making a corner gave him the opportunity that he sought
Away from the entrance on the side street the brilliant lights from
the windows shone out on a comparatively deserted pavement There was
ample light to read by even as far away from the window as the curb
and Jimmie Dale with an approving nod turned the corner and walked
along a few steps until opposite the farthest windowbut as he halted
here at the edge of the street he glanced quickly behind him at a man
whom he had just passed The other had paused at the corner and was
staring down the street Jimmie Dale instantly and nonchalantly produced
his cigarette case selected a cigarette and fastidiously tapped its
end on his thumb nail

Inspector Burton in plain clothes he observed musingly to himself I
wonder if its just a flukeor something else Well see

Jimmie Dale took a box of matches from his pocket The first would not
light The second broke and with an exclamation of annoyance he flung
it away The third was making a fitful effort at life as another man
emerged hastily from the cafes side door hurried to the corner joined
the man who was still loitering there and both together disappeared at
a rapid pace down the street

Jimmie Dale whistled softly to himself The second man was even better
known than the first there was not a crook in New York but would
sidestep Lannigan of headquarters and do it with amazing celerityif
he could

Something up But its not my hunt muttered Jimmie Dale then with
a shrug of his shoulders Queer the way those headquarters chaps
fascinate and give me a thrill every time I see them even if I havent
a ghost of a reason for imagining that

The sentence was never finished Jimmie Dales face was gray The street
seemed to rock about himand he stared like a man stricken white to
the lips ahead of him THE LETTER WAS GONE His hand wriggling from
his empty pocket swept away the sweat beads that were bursting from his
forehead It had come at lastthe pitcher had gone once too often to
the well

Numbed for an instant his brain cleared now working with lightning
speed leaping from premise to conclusion The crush in the theatre
lobbythe pushing the jostling the close contactthe Wowzer the
slickest cleverest pickpocket in the United States For a moment he
could have laughed aloud in a sort of ghastly defiant mockeryhe
himself had predicted an unexpected aftermath had he not

Aftermath It wasthe END An hour two hours and New York would be
metamorphosed into a seething caldron of humanity bubbling with the
news It seemed that he could hear the screams of the newsboys now
shouting their extras it seemed that he could see the people roused to
frenzy swarming in excited crowds snatching at the papers he seemed
to hear the mobs shouts swell in execration in exultationit seemed
as though all around him had gone mad The mystery of the Gray Seal was
solved It was Jimmie Dale Jimmie Dale Jimmie Dale the millionaire
the lion of societyand there was ignominy for an honoured name and
shame and disaster and convict stripes and sullen penitentiary wallsor
death A felons deaththe chair

He was running now his hands clenched at his sides his mind working
subconsciously urging him onward in a blind as yet unrealised
objectless way And then gradually impulse gave way to calmer reason
and he slowed his pace to a quick less noticeable walk The Wowzer
That was it There was yet a chancethe Wowzer A merciless rage
cold deadly settled upon him It was the Wowzer who had stolen his
pocketbook and with it the letter There could be no doubt of that
Well there would be a reckoning at least before the end

He was in a downtown subway train nowthe roar in his ears in
consonance it seemed with the turmoil in his brain But now too he
was Jimmie Dale again and apart from the slightly outthrust jaw the
tightclosed lips impassive debonair composed

There was yet a chance As Larry the Bat he knew every den and lair
below the dead line and he knew too the Wowzers favourite haunts
There was yet a chance only one in a thousand it was true almost too
pitiful to be depended uponbut yet a chance The Wowzer had probably
not worked alone and he and his pal or pals would certainly not
remain uptown either to examine or divide their spoilsthey would wait
until they were safe somewhere in one of their hell holes on the East
Side If he could find the Wowzer reach the man BEFORE THE LETTER WAS
OPENEDJimmie Dales lips grew tighter THAT was the chance It he
failed in thatJimmie Dales lips drooped downward in grim curves at
the corners A chance Already the Wowzer had at least a half hours
lead and worse still there was no telling which one of a dozen places
the man might have chosen to retreat to with his loot

Time passed His mind obsessed Jimmie Dales physical acts were
almost wholly mechanical It was perhaps fifteen minutes since he had
discovered the loss of the letter and he was walking now through the
heart of the Bowery Exactly how he had got there he could not have
told he had only a vague realisation that following an intuitive
sense of direction he had lost not a second of time in making his way
downtown

And now he found himself hesitating at the corner of a cross street Two
blocks east was that dark narrow alleyway that side door that made the
entrance to the Sanctuary It would be safer a hundred times safer to
go there change his clothes and his personality and emerge again as
Larry the Batinfinitely safer in that role to explore the dens of the
underworld many of them indeed unknown and undreamed of by the police
themselves than to trust himself there in wellcut fashionable
tweedsbut that would take time Time When with every second the
one chance he had desperate as that already was was slipping away from
him No what was apparently the greater risk at least held out the only
hope

He went on againhis brain incessantly at work At the worst there
was one mitigating factor in it all He had no need to think of her
Whatever the ruin and disaster that faced him in the next few hours she
in any case was safe There was no clew to HER identity in the letter
and where he for months on end with even more to work upon had failed
at every turn to trace her there was little fear that any one else
would have any better success She was safe As for himselfthat was
different The Gray Seal would be referred to in the letter there would
be the outline the data for the crime she had planned for that night
and the letter though unaddressed being found in his pocketbook
where cards and notes and a dozen different things among its contents
proclaimed him Jimmie Dale needed no further evidence as to its
ownership nor the identity of the Gray Seal

Jimmie Dales fingers crept inside his vest and fumbled there for a
momentand a diamond stud extracted from his shirt front glistened
sportively in the necktie that was now tucked jauntily in at one side of
his shirt bosom He had reached the Blue Dragon one of Wowzers usual
hang outs and swerving from the sidewalk entered the place There was
wild tumult withina constant storm of applause derision and hilarity
that was hurled from the tables around the room at the turkeytrotting
tangowrithing couples on the somewhat restricted space of polished
hardwood flooring in the centre Jimmie Dale swaggered down the room
a cigar tilted up at an angle between his teeth his soft felt hat a
little rakishly on one side of his head and well over his nose

At the end of the room at the bar Jimmie Dale leaned toward the
barkeeper and talked out of the corner of his mouth There were private
rooms upstairs and he jerked his head surreptitiously ceilingward

Say is de Wowzer up dere he inquired in a cautious whisper

The man behind the bar well known to Jimmie Dale as one of the Wowzers
particular pals favoured him with a blank stare

Never heard of de guy he announced brusquely Wots yours

Gimme a mug of suds said Jimmie Dale reaching for a match He puffed
at his cigar blew out the match and after a moment flung the charred
end awaybut on his hand as palm outward he raised it to take his
glass the match had traced a small black cross

The barkeeper put down the beer he had just drawn wiped his hand
hurriedly and with sudden enthusiasm thrust it across the bar

Glad to know youse cull he exclaimed Wots de lay

Jimmie Dale smiled

Nix said Jimmie Dale I just blew in from Chicago Used to know de
Wowzer dere He said dis place was on de level an I could always find
him here dats all

Sure youse can returned the barkeeper heartily Only he aint here
now He beat it about fifteen minutes ago him an Dago Jim I guess
yousell find him at Changs I heard him an Dago say dey was goin
dere Know de place

Jimmie Dale shook his head

I aint much wise to New York he explained

Aw dats easy whispered the barkeeper Go down to Chatham Square
an den any guyll show youse Chang Foos He winked confidentially I
guess youse wont bump yer head none gettin around inside

Jimmie Dale nodded grinned back emptied his glass and dug for a coin

Forget it observed the barkeeper cordially Dis is on me Any friend
of de Wowzers gets de glad hand here any time

Tanks said Jimmie Dale gratefully as he turned away So long
thensee youse later

Chang Foos Jimmie Dales face set even a little harder than it
had before as he swung on again down the Bowery Yes he knew Chang
Foostoo well Underground Chinatownwhere a mans life was worth the
price of an opium pillor less Mechanically his hand slipped into his
pocket and closed over the automatic that nestled there Once inwhere
he had to goand the chances were even just even that was all that
he would ever get out Again he was tempted to return to the Sanctuary
and make the attempt as Larry the Bat Larry the Bat was well enough
known to enter Chang Foos unquestioned andbut again he shook his
head and went on There was not time The Wowzer and his palit was
Dago Jim it seemedhad evidently been drinking and loitering their way
downtown from the theatre and he had gained that much on them but
by now they would be smugly tucked away somewhere in that maze of dens
below the ground and at that moment probably were gloating over the
biggest nights haul they had ever made in their lives

And if they were What then Once they knew the contents of that
letterwhat then Buy them off for a larger amount than the many
thousands offered for the capture of the Gray Seal Jimmie Dale gritted
his teeth That meant blackmail from them all his life an intolerable
existence impossible a hell on earththe slave at the beck and call
of two of the worst criminals in New York The moisture oozed again to
Jimmie Dales forehead God if he could get that letter before it was
openedbefore they KNEW If he could only get the chance to fight for
itagainst ANY odds Life Life was a pitiful consideration against the
alternative that faced him now

From the Blue Dragon to Chang Foos was not far and Jimmie Dale covered
the distance in well under five minutes Chang Foos was just a tea
merchants shop innocuous and innocent enough in its appearance
blandly so indeed and that was alloutwardly but Jimmie Dale as he
reached his destination experienced the first sensation of uplift he
had known that night and this from what apparently did not in the
least seem like a contributing cause

Luck The blessed luck of it he muttered grimly as he surveyed
the sightseeing car drawn up at the curb and watched the passengers
crowding out of it to the ground It wouldnt have been as easy to fool
old Chang as it was that fellow back at the Dragonand besides if I
can work it theres a better chance this way of getting out alive

The guide was marshalling his gaperssome two dozen in all men and
women Jimmie Dale unostentatiously fell in at the rear and the guide
leading the little crowd passed into the tea merchants shop Chang
Foo a wizened wrinkledfaced little Celestial oily suave greeted
them with profuse bows chattering the while volubly in Chinese

The guide made the introduction with an allembracing sweep of his hand

Chang Fooladies and gentlemen he announced then held up his hand
for silence Ladies and gentlemen he said impressively this is one
of the most notorious if not THE most notorious dive in Chinatown and
it is only through special arrangement with the authorities and at great
expense that the company is able exclusively to gain an entree here for
its patrons You will see here the real life of the Chinese and in half
an hour you will get what few would get in a lifetime spent in China
itself You will see the Chinese children dance and perform the Chinese
women at their household tasks the joss the shrine of his hallowed
ancestors at which Chang Foo here worships and you will enter the most
famous opium den in the United States Now if you will all keep close
together we will make a start

In spite of his desperate situation Jimmie Dale smiled a little
whimsically Yes they would see it allUPSTAIRS The same old bunk
dished out night after night at so much a headand the nervous little
schoolmaam of uncertain age who fidgeted now beside him would go
back somewhere down in Maine and shiver while she related her wider
experiences in tremulous whispers into the shocked ears of envious
other maiden ladies of equally uncertain age The same old bunkand a
profitable one for Chang Foo for more reasons than one It was dust in
the eyes of the police The police smiled knowingly at mention of Chang
Foo Who should know if they didnt that it was all harmless fake all
bunk And so it wasUPSTAIRS

They were passing out of the shop now bowed out through a side door by
the obsequious and oily Chang Foo And now they massed again in a sort
of little hallwayand Chang Foo closing the door upon Jimmie Dale who
was the last in the line shuffled back behind the counter in his shop
to resume his guard duty over customers of quite another ilk With the
door closed it was dark pitch dark And this too like everything
else connected with Chang Foos establishment for more reasons than
onefor effectand for security Nervous little twitters began to
emanate from the womenthe guides voice rose reassuringly

Keep close together ladies and gentlemen We are going upstairs now
to

Jimmie Dale hugged back against the wall sidled along it and like a
shadow slipped down to the end of the hall The scuffling of two dozen
pairs of feet mounting the creaky staircase drowned the slight sound as
he cautiously opened a door the darkness lay black impenetrable along
the hall And then as cautiously as he had opened it he closed the
door behind him and stood for an instant listening at the head of a
ladderlike stairway his automatic in his hand now It was familiar
ground to Larry the Bat The steps led down to a cellar and diagonally
across from the foot of the steps was an opening ingeniously hidden by
a heterogeneous collection of odds and ends boxes cases and rubbish
from the pseudo tea shop above a low opening in the wall to a passage
that led on through the cellars of perhaps half a dozen adjoining
houses each of which latter was leased in one name or anotherby
Chang Foo

Jimmie Dale crept down the steps and in another moment had gained the
farther side of the cellar then skirting around the ruck of cases he
stooped suddenly and passed in through the opening in the wall And
now he halted once more He was straining his eyes down a long narrow
passage whose blackness was accentuated rather than relieved by curious
wavering gossamer threads of yellow light that showed here and there
from under makeshift thresholds from doors slightly ajar Faint noises
came to him a muffled intermittent clink of coin a low continuous
droning hum of voices the sickly sweet smell of opium pricked at his
nostrils

Jimmie Dales face set rigidly It was the resort not only of the most
depraved Chinese element but of the worst white thugs that made New
York their headquartershere in the succession of cellars roughly
partitioned off to make a dozen rooms on either side of the passage
dope fiends sucked at the drug and Chinese gamblers spent the greater
part of their lives here murder was hatched and played too often to
its hellish end here the scum of the underworld sought refuge from the
police to the profit of Chang Foo and here somewhere in one of these
rooms wasthe Wowzer

The Wowzer Jimmie Dale stole forward silently without a sound
swiftlypausing only to listen for a seconds space at the doors as he
passed From this one came that clink of coin from another that jabber
of Chinese from still another that overpowering stench of opiumand
once ironnerved as he was a cold thrill passed over him Let this
lair of hells wolves so intent now on their own affairs be once
roused as they certainly must be roused before he could hope to finish
the Wowzer and his chances of escape were

He straightened suddenly alert tense strained Voices raised in a
furious quarrel came from a door just beyond him on the other side
of the passage where a film of light streamed out through a cracked
panelit was the Wowzer and Dago Jim And drunk both of themand both
in a blind fury

It happened quick then almost instantaneously it seemed to Jimmie Dale
He was crouched now close against the door his eye to the crack in the
panel There was only one figure in sightDago Jimstanding beside
a table on which burned a lamp the table top littered with watches
purses and small chatelaine bags The man was lurching unsteadily on
his feet a vicious sneer of triumph on his face waving tauntingly
an open letter and Jimmie Dales pocketbook in his handswaving them
presumably in the face of the Wowzer whom from the restrictions of the
crack Jimmie Dale could not see He was conscious of a sickening sense
of disaster His hope against hope had been in vainthe letter had been
opened and readTHE IDENTITY OF THE GRAY SEAL WAS SOLVED

Dago Jims voice roared out hoarse blasphemous in drunken rage

De Gray Sealsee Youse betcher life I knows I been waitin fer
someting like dis damn youse Youse been stallin on me fer a year
every time it came to a divvy Youseve got a pocketful now youse

Youse lie an youse knows it retorted Dago Jim Youse have given me
de short end every time weve pulled a deal

By Godthe Wowzers voice rose in a screamyouse hand over dat
letter

Youse go to

Red lurid red a stream of flame seemed to cut across Jimmie Dales
line of vision came the roar of a revolver shotand like a madman
Jimmie Dale flung his body at the door Rickety at best it crashed
inward half wrenched from its hinges precipitating him inside He
recovered himself and leaped forward The room was swirling with blue
eddies of smoke Dago Jim hands flung up still grasping letter and
pocketbook pawed at the airand plunged with a sagging lurch face
downward to the floor There was a yell and an oath from the Wowzerthe
crack of another revolver shot the hum of the bullet past Jimmie Dales
ear the scorch of the tongue flame in his face and he was upon the
other

Screeching profanity the Wowzer grappled and for an instant the two
men rocked reeled and swayed in each others embrace then both
men losing their balance they shot suddenly backward the Wowzer
undermost striking his head against the tables edgeand men table
and lamp crashed downward in a heap to the floor

It had been no more at most than a matter of seconds since Jimmie Dale
had hurled himself into the room and now with a gurgling sigh
the Wowzers arms that had been wound around Jimmie Dales back and
shoulders relaxed and from the blow on his head the man lay
back inert and stunned And then it seemed to Jimmie Dale as though
pandemonium unreality and chaos at the touch of some devils hand
reigned around him It was darkno not darka spurt of flame was
leaping along the line of trickling oil from the broken lamp on the
floor It threw into ghastly relief the sprawled form of Dago
Jim Outside from along the passageway came a confused jangle of
commotionwhispering voices shuffling feet the swish of Chinese
garments And the room itself began to spring into weird flickering
shadows that mounted and crept up the walls with the spreading fire

There was not a second to lose before the room would be swarming with
that rush from the passagewayand there was still the letter the
pocketbook The table had fallen half over Dago JimJimmie Dale pushed
it aside tore the crushed letter and the pocketbook from the mans
handsand felt with a grim horrible sort of anxiety for the others
heartbeat for the verdict that meant life or death to himself There
was no sign of lifethe man was dead

Jimmie Dale was on his feet now A face another and another showed
in the doorwaythe Wowzer was regaining his senses stumbling to his
knees There was one chancejust oneto take those crowding figures by
surprise And with a yell of Fire Jimmie Dale sprang for the doorway

They gave way before his rush tumbling back in their surprise against
the opposite wall and turning Jimmie Dale raced down the passageway
Doors were opening everywhere now forms were pushing out into the
semidarknessonly to duck hastily back again as Jimmie Dales
automatic barked and spat a running fire of warning ahead of him And
then behind the Wowzers voice shrieked out

Soak him Kill de guy Hes croaked Dago Jim Put a hole in him de

Yells a chorus of them took up the refrainthen the rush of following
feetand the passageway seemed to racket as though a Gatling gun were
in play with the fusillade of revolver shots But Jimmie Dale was at
the opening nowand like a base runner plunging for the bag he flung
himself in a low dive through and into the open cellar beyond He was
on his feet over the boxes and dashing up the stairs in a second The
door above opened as he reached the topJimmie Dales right hand shot
out with clubbed revolverand with a grunt Chang Foo went down before
the blow and the headlong rush The next instant Jimmie Dale had sprung
through the tea shop and was out on the street

A minute two minutes more and Chinatown would be in an uproarChang
Foo would see to thatand the Wowzer would prod him on The danger was
far from over yet And then as he ran Jimmie Dale gave a little gasp
of relief Just ahead drawn up at the curb stood a taxicabwaiting
probably for a private slumming party Jimmie Dale put on a spurt
reached it and wrenched the door open

Quick he flung at the startled chauffeur The nearest subway
stationtheres a tenspot in it for you Quick manQUICK Here they
come

A crowd of Chinese pouring like angry hornets from Chang Foos shop
came yelling down the streetand the taxi took the corner on two
wheelsand Jimmie Dale panting choking for his breath like a man
spent sank back against the cushions

But five minutes later it was quite another Jimmie Dale composed
nonchalant imperturbable who entered an uptown subway train and
choosing a seat alone near the centre of the car which at that hour
of night in the downtown district was almost deserted took the crushed
letter from his pocket For a moment he made no attempt to read it
his dark eyes now that he was free from observation full of troubled
retrospect fixed on the window at his side It was not a pleasant
thought that it had cost a man his life nor yet that that life was also
the price of his own freedom True if there were two men in the city of
New York whose crimes merited neither sympathy nor mercy those two men
were the Wowzer and Dago Jimbut yet after all it was a human life
and even if his own had been in the balance thank God it had been
through no act of his that Dago Jim had gone out The Wowzer cute and
cunning had been quick enough to say so to clear himself butJimmie
Dale smiled a little nowneither the Wowzer nor Chang Foo nor
Chinatown would ever be in a position to recognise their uninvited
guest

Jimmie Dales eyes shifted to the letter speculatively gravely It
seemed as though the night had already held a year of happenings and
the night was not over yetthere was the letter It had already cost
one life was it to cost anotheror what

It began as it always did He read it through once in amazement a
second time with a flush of bitter anger creeping to his cheeks and
a third time curiously memorising as it were snatches of it here and
there

There was a great deal morefour sheets of closely written data With
an exclamation almost of dismay Jimmie Dale pulled out his watch So
that was what Burton and Lannigan were up to And he had actually run
into them Lord the irony of it TheAnd then Jimmie Dale stared at
the dial of his watch incredulously It was still but barely midnight
It seemed impossible that since leaving the theatre at a few minutes
before eleven he had lived through but a single hour

Jimmie Dales fingers began to pluck at the letter tearing it into
pieces tearing the pieces over and over again into tiny shreds The
train stopped at station after station people got on and offJimmie
Dales hat was over his eyes and his eyes were glued again to the
window Had Bookkeeper Bob returned to his flat in Harlem with the
detectives at his heelsor were Burton and Lannigan still trailing the
man downtown somewhere around the cafes If the former the theft
of the letter and its incident loss of time had been an irreparable
disaster if the latterwell who knew The risk was the Gray Seals

At One Hundred and TwentyFifth Street Jimmie Dale left the train and
at the end of a sharp four minutes walk during which he had dodged in
and out from street to street stopped on a corner to survey the block
ahead of him It was a block devoted exclusively to flats and apartment
houses and apart from a few belated pedestrians was deserted Jimmie
Dale strolled leisurely down one side crossed the street at the end of
the block and strolled leisurely back on the other sidethere was no
sign of either Burton or Lannigan It was a fairly safe presumption then
that Bookkeeper Bob had not returned yet or one of the detectives at
least would have been shadowing the house

Jimmie Dale smiling a little grimly retraced his steps again and
turned deliberately into a doorwaywhose number he had noted as he had
passed a moment or so before So after all there was time yet
This was the house Number eighteen she had said in her letter A
flatthree storiesMoyne lives on ground floor

Jimmie Dale leaned against the vestibule doorthere was a faint
clicka little steel instrument was withdrawn from the lockand Jimmie
Dale stepped into the hall where a gas jet turned down burned dimly

The door of the groundfloor apartment was at his right Jimmie Dale
reached up and turned off the light Again those slim tapering
wonderfully sensitive fingers worked with the little steel instrument
this time in the lock of the apartment dooragain there was that almost
inaudible clickand then cautiously inch by inch the door opened
under his hand He peered insidedown a hallway lighted if it could be
called lighted at all by a subdued glow from two open doors that gave
upon itpeered intently listening intently as he drew a black silk
mask from his pocket and slipped it over his face And then silent as
a shadow in his movements the door left just ajar behind him he stole
down the carpeted hallway

Opposite the first of the open doorways Jimmie Dale pauseda curiously
hard expression creeping over his face his lips beginning to droop
ominously downward at the corners It was a little sitting room cheaply
but tastefully furnished and a young woman Bookkeeper Bobs wife
evidently and evidently sitting up for her husband had fallen sound
asleep in a chair her head pillowed on her arms that were outstretched
across the table For a moment Jimmie Dale held there his eyes on the
sceneand the next moment his hand curved into a clenched fist he had
passed on and entered the adjoining room

It was a childs bedroom A night lamp burned on a table beside the bed
and the soft rays seemed to play and linger in caress on the tousled
golden hair of a little girl of perhaps two years of ageand something
seemed to choke suddenly in Jimmie Dales throatthe sweet innocent
little face upturned to his was smiling at him as she slept

Jimmie Dale turned away his headhis eyelashes wet under his mask
BENEATH THE MATTRESS OF THE CHILDS BED the letter had said His face
like stone his lips a thin line now Jimmie Dales hand reached
deftly in without disturbing the child and took out a packageand then
another He straightened up a bundle of crisp new hundreddollar notes
in each handand on the top of one slipped under the elastic band that
held the bills together an unsealed envelope He drew out the latter
and opened itit was a secondclass steamship passage to Vera Cruz
made out in a fictitious name of course to John Davies the booking
for next days sailing From the ticket from the stolen money Jimmie
Dales eyes lifted to rest again on the little golden head the smiling
lipsand then dropping the packages into his pockets his own lips
moving queerly he turned abruptly to the door

My God the shame of it he whispered to himself

He crept down the corridor past the open door of the room where the
young woman still sat fast asleep and his mask in his pocket again
stepped softly into the vestibule and from there to the street

Jimmie Dale hurried now spurred on it seemed by a hot insensate fury
that raged within himthere was still one other call to make that
nightstill those remaining and minute details in the latter part of
her letter grim and ugly in their portent

It was close upon one oclock in the morning when Jimmie Dale stopped
againthis time before a fashionable dwelling just off Central Park
And here for perhaps the space of a minute he surveyed the house from
the sidewalkwatching with a sort of speculative satisfaction a mans
shadow that passed constantly to and fro across the drawn blinds of one
of the lower windows The rest of the house was in darkness

Yes said Jimmie Dale nodding his head I rather thought so The
servants will have retired hours ago Its safe enough

He ran quickly up the steps and rang the bell A door opened almost
instantly sending a faint glow into the hall from the lighted room a
hurried step crossed the halland the outer door was thrown back

Well what is it demanded a voice brusquely

It was quite dark too dark for either to distinguish the others
featuresand Jimmie Dales hat was drawn far down over his eyes

I want to see Mr Thomas H Carling cashier of the HudsonMercantile
National Bankits very important said Jimmie Dale earnestly

I am Mr Carling replied the other What is it

Jimmie Dale leaned forward

From headquarterswith a report he said in a low tone

Ah exclaimed the bank official sharply Well its about time Ive
been waiting up for itthough I expected you would telephone rather
than this Come in

Thank you said Jimmie Dale courteouslyand stepped into the hall

The other closed the front door The servants are in bed of course
he explained as he led the way toward the lighted room This way
please

Behind the other across the hall Jimmie Dale followed and close at
Carlings heels entered the room which was fitted up quite evidently
regardless of cost as a combination library and study Carling in
a somewhat pompous fashion walked straight ahead toward the
carvedmahogany flattopped desk and as he reached it waved his hand

Take a chair he said over his shoulderand then turning in the act
of dropping into his own chair grasped suddenly at the edge of the desk
instead and with a low startled cry stared across the room

Jimmie Dale was leaning back against the door that was closed now behind
himand on Jimmie Dales face was a black silk mask

For an instant neither man spoke nor moved then Carling sparebuilt
dapper in evening clothes edged back from the desk and laughed a little
uncertainly

Quite neat I compliment you From headquarters with a report I think
you said

Which I neglected to add said Jimmie Dale was to be made in
private

Carling as though to put as much distance between them as possible
continued to edge back across the roombut his small black eyes black
now to the pupils themselves never left Jimmie Dales face

In private ehhe seemed to be sparring for time as he smiled In
private Youve a strange method of securing privacy havent you A bit
melodramatic isnt it Perhaps youll be good enough to tell me who you
are

Jimmie Dale smiled indulgently

My mask is only for effect he said My name isSmith

Yes said Carling I am very stupid Thank you I he had reached
the other side of the room nowand with a quick sudden movement jerked
his hand to the dial of the safe that stood against the wall

But Jimmie Dale was quickerwithout shifting his position his
automatic whipped from his pocket held a disconcerting bead on
Carlings forehead

Please dont do that said Jimmie Dale softly Its rather a good
make that safe I dare say it would take me half an hour to open it I
was rather curious to know whether it was locked or not

Carlings hand dropped to his side

So he sneered Thats it is it The ordinary variety of sneak
thief His voice was rising gradually Well sir let me tell you
that

Mr Carling said Jimmie Dale in a low even tone unless you
moderate your voice some one in the house might hear youI am quite
well aware of that But if that happens if any one enters this room
if you make a move to touch a button or in any other way attempt to
attract attention Ill drop you where you stand His hand behind his
back extracted the key from the door lock held it up for the other to
see then dropped it into his pocketand his voice cold before rang
peremptorily now Come back to the desk and sit down in that chair he
ordered

For a moment Carling hesitated then with a halfmuttered oath obeyed

Jimmie Dale moved over and stood in front of Carling on the other side
of the deskand stared silently at the immaculate fashionably groomed
figure before him

Under the prolonged gaze Carlings composure in a measure at least
seemed to forsake him He began to drum nervously with his fingers on
the desk and shift uneasily in his chair

And then from first one pocket and then the other Jimmie Dale took
the two packages of banknotes and still with out a word pushed them
across the desk until they lay under the others eyes

Carlings fingers stopped their drumming slid to the desk edge
tightened there and a whiteness crept into his face Then with an
effort he jerked himself erect in his chair

Whats this he demanded hoarsely

About ten thousand dollars I should say said Jimmie Dale slowly I
havent counted it Your bank was robbed this evening at closing time I
understand

Yes Carlings voice was excited now the colour back in his face
But youhowdo you mean that you are returning the money to the
bank

Exactly said Jimmie Dale

Carling was once more the pompous bank official He leaned back and
surveyed Jimmie Dale critically with his little black eyes

Ah quite so he observed That accounts for the mask But I am still
a little in the dark Under the circumstances it is quite impossible
that you should have stolen the money yourself and

I didnt said Jimmie Dale I found it hidden in the home of one of
your employees

You found itWHERE

In Moynes homeup in Harlem

Moyne eh Carling was alert quick now jerking out his words How
did you come to get into this then His pal Doublecrossing him eh I
suppose you want a rewardwell attend to that of course Youre
wiser than you know my man Thats what we suspected Weve had the
detectives trailing Moyne all evening He reached forward over the desk
for the telephone Ill telephone headquarters to make the arrest at
once

Just a minute interposed Jimmie Dale gravely I want you to listen
to a little story first

A story What has a story got to do with this snapped Carling

The man has got a home said Jimmie Dale softly A home and a
wifeand a little baby girl

Oh thats the game then eh You want to plead for him Carling flung
out gruffly Well he should have thought of all that before Its
quite useless for you to bring it up The man has had his chance
alreadya better chance than any one with his record ever had before
We took him into the bank knowing that he was an exconvict but
believing that we could make an honest man of himand this is the
result

And yet

NO said Carling icily

You refuseabsolutely Jimmie Dales voice had a lingering wistful
note in it

I refuse said Carling bluntly I wont have anything to do with it

There was just an instants silence and then with a strange slow
creeping motion as a panther creeps when about to spring Jimmie Dale
projected his body across the deskfar across it toward the other And
the muscles of his jaw were quivering his words rasping choked with
the sweep of fury that held back so long broke now in a passionate
surge

And shall I tell you why you wont Your bank was robbed tonight of
one hundred thousand dollars There are ten thousand here THE OTHER
NINETY THOUSAND ARE IN YOUR SAFE

You lie Ashen to the lips Carling had risen in his chair You lie
he cried Do you hear You lie I tell you you lie

Jimmie Dales lips parted ominously

Sit down he gritted between his teeth

The white in Carlings face had turned to gray his lips were
workingmechanically he sank down again in his chair

Jimmie Dale still leaned over the desk resting his weight on his right
elbow the automatic in his right hand covering Carling

You cur whispered Jimmie Dale Theres just one reason only one
that keeps me from putting a bullet through you while you sit there
Well get to that in a moment There is that little story firstshall
I tell it to you now For the past four years and God knows how many
before that youve gone the pace The lavishness of this bachelor
establishment of yours is common talk in New Yorkfar in excess of a
bank cashiers salary But you were supposed to be a wealthy man in your
own right and so in reality you wereonce But you went through
your fortune two years ago Counted a model citizen an upright man an
honour to the communitywhat were you Carling What ARE you Shall I
tell you Roue gambler leading a double life of the fastest kind You
did it cleverly Carling hid it wellbut your game is up Tonight
for instance you are at the end of your tether swamped with debts
exposure threatening you at any moment Why dont you tell me again that
I lieCarling

But now the man made no answer He had sunk a little deeper in his
chaira dawning look of terror in the eyes that held fascinated on
Jimmie Dale

You cur said Jimmie Dale again You cur with your devils work A
year ago you saw this night comingwhen you must have money or face
ruin and exposure You saw it then a year ago the day that Moyne
concealing nothing of his prison record applied through friends for a
position in the bank Your coofficials were opposed to his appointment
but you do you remember how you pleaded to give the man his chanceand
in your hellish ingenuity saw your way then out of the trap An
exconvict from Sing Sing It was enough wasnt it What chance had
he Jimmie Dale paused his left hand clenched until the skin formed
whitish knobs over the knuckles

Carlings tongue sought his lips made a circuit of themand he tried
to speak but his voice was an incoherent muttering

Ill not waste words said Jimmie Dale in his grim monotone Im not
sure enough myselfthat I could keep my hands off you much longer The
actual details of how you stole the money today do not matterNOW A
little later perhaps in courtbut not now You were the last to leave
the bank but before leaving you pretended to discover the theft of a
hundred thousand dollarsthat done up in a paper parcel was even then
reposing in your desk You brought the parcel home put it in that safe
thereand notified the president of the bank by telephone from here of
the robbery suggesting that police headquarters be advised at once He
told you to go ahead and act as you saw best You notified the police
speciously directing suspicion tothe exconvict in the banks employ
You knew Moyne was dining out tonight you knew whereand at a hint
from you the police took up the trail A little later in the evening
you took these two packages of banknotes from the rest and with this
steamship ticketwhich you obtained yesterday while out at lunch by
sending a district messenger boy with the money and instructions in a
sealed envelope to purchase for youyou went up to the Moynes flat in
Harlem for the purpose of secreting them somewhere there You pretended
to be much disappointed at finding Moyne outyou had just come for a
little social visit to get better acquainted with the home life of your
employees Mrs Moyne was genuinely pleased and grateful She took you
in to see their little girl who was already asleep in bed She left
you there for a moment to answer the doorand youyouJimmie Dales
voice choked againyou blot on Gods earth you slipped the money and
ticket under the childs mattress

Carling came forward with a lurch in his chairand his hands went out
pawing in a wild pleading fashion over Jimmie Dales arm

Jimmie Dale flung him away

You were safe enough he rasped on The police could only construe
your visit to Moynes flat as zeal on behalf of the bank And it
was safer much more circumspect on your part not to order the flat
searched at once but only as a last resort as it were after you
had led the police to trail him all evening and still remain without
a clewand besides of course not until you had planted the evidence
that was to damn him and wreck his life and home You were even generous
in the amount you deprived yourself of out of the hundred thousand
dollarsfor less would have been enough Caught with ten thousand
dollars of the banks money and a steamship ticket made out in a
fictitious name it was primafacie evidence that he had done the job
and had the balance somewhere What would his denials his protestations
of innocence count for He was an exconvict a hardened criminal caught
redhanded with a portion of the proceeds of robberyhe had succeeded
in hiding the remainder of it too cleverly that was all

Carlings face was ghastly His hands went out againagain his tongue
moistened his dry lips He whispered

Isntisnt there somesome way we can fix this

And then Jimmie Dale laughednot pleasantly

Yes theres a way Carling he said grimly Thats why Im here He
picked up a sheet of writing paper and pushed it across the deskthen a
pen which he dipped into the inkstand and extended to the other The
way youll fix it will be to write out a confession exonerating Moyne

Carling shrank back into his chair his head huddling into his
shoulders

NO he cried I wontI cantmy GodIIWONT

The automatic in Jimmie Dales hand edged forward the fraction of an
inch

I have not used thisyet You understand now whydont you he said
under his breath

No no Carling pushed away the pen Im ruinedruined as it is But
this would mean the penitentiary too

Where you tried to send an innocent man in your place you hound where
you

Some other waysome other way Carling was babbling Let me out of
thisfor Gods sake let me out of this

Carling said Jimmie Dale hoarsely I stood beside a little bed
tonight and looked at a baby girla little baby girl with golden hair
who smiled as she slept

Carling shivered and passed a shaking hand across his face

Take this pen said Jimmie Dale monotonously orTHIS The
automatic lifted until the muzzle was on a line with Carlings eyes

Carlings hand reached out still shaking and took the pen and his
body dragged limply forward hung over the desk The pen spluttered on
the papera bead of sweat spurting from the mans forehead dropped to
the sheet

There was silence in the room A minute passedanother Carlings pen
travelled haltingly across the paper then with a queer low cry as
he signed his name he dropped the pen from his fingers and rising
unsteadily from his chair stumbled away from the desk toward a couch
across the room

An instant Jimmie Dale watched the other then he picked up the sheet of
paper It was a miserable document miserably scrawled


I guess its all up I guess I knew it would be some day Moyne hadnt
anything to do with it I stole the money myself from the bank tonight
I guess its all up

THOMAS H CARLING


From the paper Jimmie Dales eyes shifted to the figure by the
couchand the paper fluttered suddenly from his fingers to the desk
Carling was reeling clutching at his throata small glass vial rolled
upon the carpet And then even as Jimmie Dale sprang forward the other
pitched head long over the couchand in a moment it was over

Presently Jimmie Dale picked up the vialand dropped it back on the
floor again There was no label on it but it needed nonethe strong
penetrating odor of bitter almonds was telltale evidence enough It was
prussic or hydrocyanic acid probably the most deadly poison and the
swiftest in its action that was known to scienceCarling had provided
against that some day in his confession

For a little space motionless Jimmie Dale stood looking down at the
silent outstretched formthen he walked slowly back to the desk and
slowly deliberately picked up the signed confession and the steamship
ticket He held them an instant staring at them then methodically
began to tear them into little pieces a strange tired smile hovering
on his lips The man was dead nowthere would be disgrace enough for
some one to bear a mother perhapswho knew And there was another way
nowsince the man was dead

Jimmie Dale put the pieces in his pocket went to the safe opened it
and took out a parcel locked the safe carefully and carried the parcel
to the desk He opened it there Inside were nearly two dozen little
packages of hundreddollar bills The other two packages that he had
brought with him he added to the rest From his pocket he took out the
thin metal insignia case and with the tiny tweezers lifted up one of
the graycoloured diamondshaped paper seals He moistened the
adhesive side and still holding it by the tweezers dropped it on
his handkerchief and pressed the seal down on the face of the topmost
package of banknotes He tied the parcel up then and picking up the
pen addressed it in printed characters


HUDSONMERCANTILE NATIONAL BANK

NEW YORK CITY


District messengersome wayin the morning he murmured

Jimmie Dale slipped his mask into his pocket and with the parcel under
his arm stepped to the door and unlocked it He paused for an instant
on the threshold for a single quick comprehensive glance around the
roomthen passed on out into the street

At the corner he stopped to light a cigaretteand the flame of the
match spurting up disclosed a face that was worn and haggard He threw
the match away smiled a little wearilyand went on

The Gray Seal had committed another crime



CHAPTER VII

THE THIEF


Choosing between the snowy napery the sparkling glass and silver the
cozy shaded tablelamps the famous French chef of the ultraexclusive
St James Club his own home on Riverside Drive where a dinner fit for
an epicure and served by Jason that most perfect of butlers awaited
him and Marliannes Jimmie Dale driving in alone in his touring car
from an afternoons golf had chosenMarliannes

Marliannes if such a thing as Bohemianism or rather a concrete
expression of it exists was Bohemian A twopiece string orchestra
played valiantly to the accompaniment of a hoarsethroated piano and
between courses the diners took up the refrainand as it was always
between courses with some one the place was a bedlam of noisy riot
Nevertheless it was Marliannesand Jimmie Dale liked Marliannes He
had dined there many times before as he had just dined in the person of
Jimmie Dale the millionaire his highpriced imported car at the curb
of the shabby street outsideand he had dined there disreputable in
attire seedy in appearance with the police yelping at his heels as
Larry the Bat In either character Marliannes had welcomed him with
equal courtesy to its spotted linen and most excellent tabledhote with
VIN ORDINAIREfor fifty cents

And now in the act of reaching into his pocket for the change to pay
his bill Jimmie Dale seemed suddenly to experience some difficulty in
finding what he sought and his fingers went fumbling from one pocket
to another Two men at the table in front of him were talkingtheir
voices over a momentary lull in violin squeaks talk laughter
singing and the clatter of dishes reached him

Carling commit suicide Not on your life No of course he didnt It
was that cursed Gray Seal croaked him just as sure as you sit in that
chair

The other grunted Yes but whatd the Gray Seal want to pinch a
hundred thousand out of the bank for and then give it back again the
next morning

Whats he done a hundred other things for to cover up the real object
of what hes after retorted the first speaker with a short vicious
laugh then with a thump of his fist on the table The mans a devil
a fiend and anywhere else but New York hed have been caught and sent
to the chair where he belongs long ago and

A burst of ragtime drowned out the mans words Jimmie Dale placed a
fiftycent piece and a tip beside it on his dinner check pushed
back his chair and rose from the table There was a halftolerantly
satirical halfangry glint in his dark steady eyes It was not only
the police who yelped at his heels but every man woman and child in
the city The man had not voiced his own sentimentshe had voiced the
sentiments of New York And it was quite on the cards that if he Jimmie
Dale were ever caught his destination would not even be the death cell
and the chair at Sing Singhis fellow citizens had reached a pitch
where they would be quite capable of literally tearing him to pieces if
they ever got their hands on him

And yet there were a few a very few a handful out of five millions
who sometimes remembered perhaps to thank God that the Gray Seal
livedthat was his reward Thatand SHE whose mysterious letters
prompted and impelled his the Gray Seals acts Shenameless
fascinating in her brilliant resourcefulness amazing in her power a
woman whose life was bound up with his and yet held apart from him in
the most inexplicable absorbing way a woman he had never seen save
for her gloved arm in the limousine that night who at one unexpected
moment projected a dazzling impersonal existence across his path and
the next leaving him battling for his life where greed and passion and
crime swirled about him was gone

Jimmie Dale threaded the small crowded roomsthe interior of
Marliannes had never been altered from the days when the place had been
a family residence of some pretensionand reaching the hall received
his hat from the frowsylooking boy in attendance He passed outside
and at the top of the steps paused as he took his cigarette case
from his pocket It was nearly a week since Carling the cashier of
the HudsonMercantile National Bank had been found dead in his home
a bottle that had contained hydrocyanic acid on the floor beside him
nearly a week since Bookkeeper Bob unaware that he had ever been under
temporary suspicion for the robbery of the bank had equally unknown
to himself been cleared of any complicity in that affairand yet as
witness the conversation of a moment ago it was still the topic of New
York still the vital issue that filled the maw of the newspapers
with ravings threats and execrations against the Gray Seal snarling
virulently the while at the police for the latters ineptitude
inefficiency and impotence

Jimmie Dale closed his cigarette case with a snap that was almost human
in its irony dropped it back into his pocket and lighted a matchbut
the flame was arrested halfway to the tip of his cigarette as his eyes
fixed suddenly and curiously on a womans form hurrying down the street
She had turned the corner before he took his eyes from her and the
match between his fingers had gone out Not that there was anything very
strange in a woman walking or even half running along the street nor
that there was anything particularly attractive or unusual about
her and if there had been the street was too dark for him to have
distinguished it It was not thatit was the fact that she had neither
passed by the house on whose steps he stood nor come out of any of the
adjoining houses It was as though she had suddenly and miraculously
appeared out of thin air and taken form on a sidewalk a little way down
from Marliannes

Thats queer commented Jimmie Dale to himself However He took
out another match lighted his cigarette jerked the match stub away
from him and with a lift of his shoulders went down the steps

He crossed the pavement walked around the front of his machine since
the steering wheel was on the side next to the curb and with his hand
out to open the car doorstopped Some one had been tampering with
itit was not quite closed There was no mistake Jimmie Dale made
no mistakes of that kind a man whose life hung a dozen times a day on
little things could not afford to make them He had closed it firmly
even with a bang when he had got out

Instantly suspicious he wrenched the door wide open switched on
the light under the hood and with a sharp exclamation bent quickly
forward A glove a womans glove a white glove lay on the floor of the
car Jimmie Dales pulse leaped suddenly into fierce pounding beats It
was HERS He KNEW that intuitivelyknew it as he knew that he breathed
And that woman he had so leisurely watched as she had disappeared from
sight was must have beenshe

He sprang from the car with a jump his first impulse to dash after
herand checked himself laughing a little bitterly It was too late
for that nowhe had already let his chance slip through his fingers
Around the corner was Sixth Avenue surface cars the elevated
taxicabs a multitude of people any one of a hundred ways in which
she could and would already have discounted pursuit from himand
besides he would not even have been able to recognise her if he saw
her

Jimmie Dales smile was mirthless as he turned back to the car and
picked up the glove Why had she dropped it there It could not have
been intentional Why hadhe began to tear suddenly at the gloves
little finger and in another second kneeling on the cars step his
shoulders inside he was holding a ring close under the little electric
bulb

It was a gold seal ring a small dainty thing that bore a crest
a bell surmounted by a bishops mitrethe bell quaint in design
harking the imagination back to some oldtime belfry tower And
underneath in the scrolla motto It was a full minute before Jimmie
Dale could decipher it for the lettering was minute and the words of
course reversed It was in French SONNEZ LE TOCSIN

He straightened up the glove and ring in his hand a puzzled expression
on his face It was strange Had she after all dropped the glove
there intentionally had she at last let down the barriers just a little
between them and given him this little intimate sign that she

And then Jimmie Dale laughed abruptly selfmockingly He was only
trying to deceive himself to argue himself into believing what with
heart and soul he wanted to believe It was not like herand neither
was it so His eyes had fixed on the seat beside the wheel He had not
used the lap rug all that day he couldnt use a rug and drive he had
left it folded and hanging on the rack in the tonneauit was now neatly
folded and reposing on the front seat

Yes said Jimmie Dale a sort of selfpity in his tones I might have
known

He lifted the rug Beneath it on the leather seat lay a white envelope
Her letter The letter that never came save with the plan of some grim
desperate work outlined aheadthe call to arms for the Gray Seal
SONNEZ LE TOCSIN Ring the Tocsin Sound the alarm The Tocsin
The words were running through his brain A strange motto on that
crestthat seemed so strangely apt The Tocsin Never once in all the
times that he had heard from her never once in the years that had gone
since that initial letter of hers had struck its first warning note
had any communication from her been but to sound again a new alarmthe
Toscin The Tocsinthe word seemed to visualise her to give her a
concrete form and being to breathe her very personality

The TocsinJimmie Dale whispered the word softly a little
wistfully Yes I shall call you thatthe Tocsin

He folded the glove very carefully placed it with the ring in his
pocketbook picked up the letterand with a sharp exclamation turned
it quickly over in his fingers then bent hurriedly with it to the
light

Strange things were happening that night For the first time the letter
was not even SEALED That was not like her either What did it mean
Quick alert now anxious even he pulled the double folded sheets
from the envelope glanced rapidly through themand after a moment a
smile whimsical came slowly to his lips

It was quite plain nowall of it The glove the ring and the unsealed
letterand the postscript held the secret or rather what had been
intended for a postscript did for it comprised only a few words ending
abruptly unfinished Look in the cupboard at the rear of the room The
man with the red wig is That was all and the words written in ink
were badly blurred as though the paper had been hastily folded before
the ink was dry

It was quite plain and in view of the real explanation of it all
eminently characteristic of her With the letter already written she
had come there meaning to place it on the seat and cover it with the
rug as indeed she had done then deciding to add the postscript and
because she would attract less attention that way than in any other she
had climbed into the car as though it belonged to her and had seated
herself there to write it She would have been hurried in her movements
of course and in pulling off her glove to use the fountain pen the ring
had come with it The rest was obvious She had but just begun to write
when he had appeared on the steps She had slipped instantly down to
the floor of the car probably dropping the glove from her lap hastily
inclosed the letter in the envelope which she had no time to seal
thrust the envelope under the rug and forgetting her glove and fearful
of risking his attention by attempting to close the door firmly
had stolen along the body of the car only to be noticed by him too
latewhen she was well down the street

And at that latter thought once more chagrin seized Jimmie Dalethen
he turned impulsively to the letter All this was extraneous apartfor
another time when every moment was not a priceless asset as it very
probably was now

Dear Philanthropic Crookit always began that way never any other
way He read on more and more intently crouched there close to the
light on the floor of his car lips thinning as he proceededread it to
the end absorbing memorising itand then the abortive postscript

Look in the cupboard at the rear of the room The man with the red wig
is

For an instant as mechanically he tore the letter into little shreds
he held there hesitantand the next slamming the door tight he flung
himself into the seat behind the wheel and the big sixtyhorsepower
selfstarting machine was roaring down the street

The Tocsin There was a grim smile on Jimmie Dales lips now The alarm
Yes it was always an alarm quick sudden an emergency to face on the
instantplans decisions to be made with no time to ponder them with
only that one fact to consider staggering enough in itself that a
mistake meant disaster and ruin to some one else and to himself if
the courts were merciful where he had little hope for mercy the
penitentiary for life

And now tonight again as it almost always was when these mysterious
letters came every moment of inaction was piling up the odds against
him And too the same problem confronted him How in what way in
what role must he play the nights game to its end As Larry the Bat

The car was speeding forward He was heading down Broadway now lower
Broadway that stretched before him deserted like some dark narrow
canyon where far below like towering walls the buildings closed
together and seemed to converge into some black impassable barrier The
street lights flashed by him a patrolman stopped the swinging of his
nightstick and turned to gaze at the car that rushed by at a rate
perilously near to contempt of speed laws street cars passed at
indifferent intervals pedestrians were few and far betweenit was the
lower Broadway of night

Larry the Bat Jimmie Dale shook his head impatiently over the steering
wheel No that would not do It would be well enough for this young
Burton perhaps but not for old Isaac the East Side fencefor Isaac
knew him in the character of Larry the Bat His quick keen brain
weaving eliminating devising scheming discarded that idea The final
coup of the night as yet but sensed in an indefinite unshaped way if
enacted in the person of Larry the Bat would therefore stamp Larry the
Bat and the Gray Seal as onea contretemps but little less fatal in
view of old Issac than to bracket the Gray Seal and Jimmie Dale Larry
the Bat was not a character to be assumed with impunity nor one to
jeopardizeit was a bulwark of safety at it were to which more than
once he owed escape from capture and discovery

He lifted his shoulders with a sudden jerk of decision as the car
swerved to the left and headed for the East Side There was only
one alternative thenthe black silk mask that folded into such tiny
compass and that together with an automatic and the curious thin
metal case that looked so like a cigarette case was always in his
pocket for an emergency

The car turned again and approaching its destination Jimmie Dale
slowed down the speed perceptibly It was a strange case not a pleasant
oneand the raw edges where they showed were ugly in their nakedness
Old Isaac Pelina young Burton and MaddonK Wilmington Maddon the
wallpaper magnate Curious that of the three he should already know
twoold Isaac and Maddon Everybody in the East Side every denizen
of the underworld and many who posed on a far higher plane knew old
Isaacfence to the most select clientele of thieves in New York
unscrupulous hand in glove with any rascality or crime that promised
profit a money lender a Shylock without even a Shylocks humanity as
a saving grace Yes as Larry the Bat he knew old Isaac and he knew him
not only personally but by firsthand reputationhe had heard the man
cursed in blasphemous wholesouled abandon by more than one crook who
was in the old fences toils They dealt with him the crooks while
they swore to get him because he was safe butJimmie Dales lips
parted in a mirthless smilesome day old Isaac would be found in that
spiders den of his back of the dingy loan office with a knife in his
heart or a bullet through his head And K Wilmington MaddonJimmie
Dales smile grew whimsicalhe had known Maddon quite intimately for
years had even dined with him at the St James Club only a few nights
before Maddon was a man in his own setand Maddon interfered with
was likely to prove none too tractable a customer to handle And young
Burton the letter had said was Maddons private and confidential
secretary Jimmie Dales lips thinned again Well Burtons acquaintance
was still to be made It was a curious trioand it was dirty work more
raw than cunning more devilish than ingenious blackmail in its most
hellish form the stake at the least calculation a cool half million
A heavy price for a single slip in a mans life

He brought the car abruptly to a halt at the edge of the curb and
sprang out to the ground He was in front of The Budapest restaurant
a garish establishment most popular of all resorts for the moment on
the East Side where Fifth Avenue in the fond belief that it was seeing
the real thing in seamy life engaged its table a week in advance
Jimmie Dale pushed a bill into the door attendants hand accompanied by
an injunction to keep an eye on the machine and entered the cafe

But for a sort of tinselled ostentation the place might well have been
the Marliannes that he had just leftit was crowded and riot was
at its height a stringed orchestra in Hungarian costume played what
purported to be Hungarian airs shouts laughter clatter of dishes
and thump of steins added to the din He made his way between the
closepacked tables to the stairs and descended to the lower floor
Here if anything the confusion was greater than above but here
too was an exit through to the rear streetand a moment later he was
sauntering past the front of an unkempt little pawnshop closed for
the night over whose door in the murk of a distant street lamp three
balls hung in sagging disarray tawny with age and across whose dirty
unwashed windows letters missing ran the legend


IS AC PELINA Pawn brok r


The pawnshop made the corner of a very dark and narrow laneand with a
quick glance around him to assure himself that he was unobserved Jimmie
Dale stepped into the alleyway and lost instantly in the blacker
shadows stole along by the wall of the pawnshop Old Isaacs business
was not all done through the front door

And then suddenly Jimmie Dale shrank still closer against the wall Was
it intuition premonitionor reality There seemed an uncanny feeling
of PRESENCE around him as though perhaps he were watched as though
others beside himself were in the lane Yes ahead of him a shadow
movedhe could just barely distinguish it now that his eyes had grown
accustomed to the darkness It like himself was close against the
wall and now it slunk noiselessly down the length of the lane until he
lost sight of it AND WHAT WAS THAT He strained his ears to listen It
seemed like a window being opened or closed cautiously stealthily the
fraction of an inch at a time And then he located the soundit came
from the other side of the lane and very nearly opposite to where on
the second floor a dull yellow glow shone out from old Isaacs private
den in the rear of the pawnshops office

Jimmie Dales brows were gathered in sharp furrows There was evidently
something afoot tonight of which the Tocsin had NOT sounded the alarm
And then the frown relaxed and he smiled a little Miraculous as was
the means through which she obtained the knowledge that was the basis of
their strange partnership it was no more miraculous than her unerring
accuracy in the minutest details The Tocsin had never failed him yet
It was possible that something was afoot around him quite probable
indeed since he was in the most vicious part of the city in the heart
of gangland but whatever it might be it was certainly extraneous to
his mission or she would have mentioned it

The lane was empty now he was quite sure of thatand there was
no further sound from the window opposite He started forward once
moreonly to halt again for the second time as abruptly as before
squeezing if possible even more closely against the wall Some one had
turned into the lane from the sidewalk and walking hurriedly choosing
with evident precaution the exact centre of the alleyway came toward
him

The man passed his hurried stride a half run and a few feet beyond
halted at old Isaacs side door From somewhere inside the old building
Jimmie Dales ears caught the faint ringing of an electric bell a
long ring followed in quick succession by three short onesthen the
repeated clicking of a latch as though pulled by a cord from above and
the man passed in through the door closing it behind him

Jimmie Dale nodded to himself in the darkness It was a spring lock the
signal was one long ring and three short onesthe Tocsin had not missed
even those small details Also Burton was late for his appointment for
that must have been Burtonbusiness such as old Isaac had in hand
that night would have permitted the entrance of no other visitor but K
Wilmington Maddons private secretary

He moved down the lane to the door and tried it softly It was locked
of course The slim tapering sensitive fingers whose tips were eyes
and ears to Jimmie Dale felt over the lockand a slender little steel
instrument slipped into the keyhole A moment more and the catch was
released and the door under his hand began to open With it ajar
he paused his eyes searching intently up and down the lane There was
nothing no sign of any one no moving shadows now His gaze shifted to
the window opposite Directly facing it now with the dull reflection
upon it from the lighted window of old Isaacs den above his head he
could make out that it was openbut that was all

Once more he smileda little tolerantly at himself this time Some one
had been in the lane some one had opened the window of his or her
room in that tenement house across from himsurely there was nothing
surprising unnatural or even out of the commonplace in that He had
been a little bit on edge himself perhaps and the sudden movement of
that shadow unexpected had startled him for the moment as in all
probability the opening of the window had startled the skulking figure
itself into action

The door was open now He stepped noiselessly inside and closed it
noiselessly behind him He was in a narrow hall where a few yards away
a light shone down a stairway at right angles to the hall itself

Rear door of pawnshop opens into hall and exactly opposite very short
flight of stairs leading directly to doorway of Isaacs den above
Ramshackle old place low ceilings Isaac when sitting in his den can
look down and by means of a transom over the rear door of the shop
see the customers as they enter from the street while he also keeps an
eye on his assistant Latter always locks up and leaves promptly at six
oclock Jimmie Dale was subconsciously repeating to himself snatches
from the Tocsins letter which as subconsciously in reading he had
memorised almost word for word

And now voices reached himone excited nervous as though the
speaker were labouring under mental strain that bordered closely on
the hysterical the other curiously mingling a querulousness with an
attempt to pacify but dominantly contemptuous sneering cold

Jimmie Dale moved along the hallvery slowlywithout a soundtesting
each step before he threw his body weight from one leg to the other He
reached the foot of the stairs The Tocsin had been right it was a very
short flight He counted the stepsthere were eight Above facing him
a door was open The voices were louder now It was a sordidlooking
room what he could see of it povertystricken in its appearance
intentionally so probably for effect with no attempt whatever at
furnishing He could see through the doorway to the window that opened
on the alleyway or rather just glimpse the top of the window at an
angle across the roomthat and a bare stretch of floor The two men
were not in the line of vision

Burtons voiceit was unquestionably Burton speakingcame to Jimmie
Dale now distinctly

No I didnt I tell you I didnt II hadnt the nerve

Jimmie Dale slipped his black silk mask over his face and with extreme
caution on hands and knees began to climb the stairs

So It was old Isaac now in a half purr half sneer And I was so
sure my young friend that you had I was so sure that you were not
such a fool Yes I could even have sworn that they were in your pocket
nowwhat It is too badtoo bad It is not a pleasant thing to think
of that little chair up the river in its horrible little room where

For Gods sake Isaacnot that Do you hearnot that My God I
didnt mean toI didnt know what I was doing

Jimmie Dale crept up another step another and another There was
silence for a moment in the room then Burton again hoarsevoiced

Isaac Ill make good to you some other way I swear I willI swear
it If Im caught at this IllIll get fifteen years for it

And which would you rather have Jimmie Dale could picture the oily
smirk the shrug of his shoulders the outthrust hands palms upward
elbows in at the hips the fingers curved and wide apartfifteen
years or what you getfor murder Eh my friend you have thought of
thateh It is a very little price I askyes

Damn you Burtons voice was shrill then dropped to a half sob No
no Isaac I didnt mean that Only for Gods sake be merciful It is
not only the risk of the penitentiary its more than that II tried
to play white all my life and until that cursed night theres no man
living could say I havent You know thatyou know that Isaac I tell
you I couldnt do it this afternoonI tell you I couldnt I tried to
andand I couldnt

Jimmie Dale was lying flat on the little landing now peering into the
room Back a short distance from the doorway a repulsivelooking
little man in unkempt clothes and soiled linen with yellowishskinned
parchment face out of which small black eyes shone cunningly and
shrewdly sat at a bare deal table in a rickety chair facing him across
the table stood a young man of not more than twentyfive clean cut
well dressed but whose face was unnaturally white now and whose hand
as he extended it in a pleading gesture toward the other trembled
visibly Jimmie Dales hand made its way quietly to his side pocket and
extracted his automatic

Old Isaac humped his shoulders and leered at his visitor

We talk a great deal my young friend What is the use A bargain is
a bargain A few rubies in exchange for your life A few rubies and my
mouth is shut Otherwisehe humped his shoulders again Well

Burton drew back swept his hand in a dazed way across his eyesand
laughed out suddenly in bitter mirth

A few rubies he cried The most magnificent stones on this side of
the watera FEW rubies Its been Maddons life hobby Every child in
New York knows that A fewyes theres only a fewbut those few are
worth a fortune He trusts me the man has been like a father to me
and

So you are the very last to be suspected observed old Isaac suavely
Have I not told you that There is nothing to fear Did we not arrange
everything so nicelyeh my young friend See it was tonight that
Maddon gives a little reception to his friends and did you not say that
the rubies would be taken from the safedeposit vault this afternoon
since his friends always clamoured to see them as a very fitting
conclusion to an evenings entertainment And did you not say that you
very naturally had access to the safe in the library where you worked
and that he would not notice they were gone until he came to look
for them some time this evening I think you said all that And what
suspicion let alone proof would attach itself to you You were out of
the room once when he too was absent for perhaps half an hour It
is very simple In that half hour some one somehow abstracted them
Certainly it was not you You see how little I askand I pay well do I
not And so I gave you until tonight Three days have gone and I have
said nothing and the body has not been foundeh But tonightehit
was understood The rubiesor the chair

Burtons lips moved but it was a moment before he could speak

You wouldnt dare he whispered thickly You wouldnt dare Id tell
the story ofof what you tried to make me do and theyd send you up
for it

Old Isaac shrugged with pitying contempt

Is it after all a fool I am dealing with he sneered And Iwhat
should I say That you had stolen the stones from your employer and
offered them as a bribe to silence me and that I had refused The very
act of handing you over to the police would prove the truth of what I
said and rob you of even a chance of leniencyFOR THAT OTHER THING Is
it not soeh And why did I not hand you over at once three nights ago
Believe me my young friend I should have a very good reason ready a
dozen if necessary if it came to that But we are borrowing trouble
are we not We shall not come to thateh

For a moment it seemed to Jimmie Dale as he watched that Burton would
hurl himself upon the other White to the lips the muscles of his face
twitching Burton clenched his fists and leaned over the tableand
then with sudden revulsion of emotion he drew back once more and once
more came that choked sob

Youll pay for this Isaacyour turn will come for this

I have been threatened very often snapped the other contemptuously
Bah what are threats I laugh at themas I always will Then with
a quick change of front his voice a sudden snarl Well we have
talked enough You have your choice The stones oreh And it is
tonightNOW

The old pawnbroker sprawled back in his chair a cunning leer on his
vicious face a gleam of triumph greed in the beady ratlike eyes that
never wavered from the other Burton moisture oozing from his forehead
stood there hesitant staring back at old Isaac half in a fascinated
gaze half as though trying to read some sign of weakness in the bestial
countenance that confronted him And then very slowly in an automatic
machinelike way his hand groped into the inside pocket of his
vestand old Isaac cackled out in derision

So You thought you could bluff me ehyou thought you could fool old
Isaac Bah I read you like a book Did I not tell you a while back that
you had them in your pocket I know your kind my young friend I know
your kind very well indeedit is my business You would not have
dared to come here tonight without the price So You took them this
afternoon as we agreed Yes yes you did well You will not regret it
And now let me see themhis voice rose eagerlylet me see them now
my young friend

Yes I took them Burton spoke listlessly God help me

Old Isaac quivering excited like a different creature now sprang
from his chair and as Burton drew a long flat leather case from
his pocket snatched it from the others hand His fingers in their
rapacious haste could not at first manipulate the catch and then
finally with the case open he bent over the table feverishly The
light reflected back as from some living mass of crimson fire now
shading darkly now glowing into wondrous colourful transparency as he
moved the case to and fro with jerky motions of his handsand he was
babbling crooning to himself like one possessed

Ah the little beauties Ah the pretty little things Yes yes these
are the ones This is the great Araconsee see the sixsided prism
terminated by the sixsided pyramid But it must be cutit must be cut
to sell it eh Ah it is too badtoo bad And this this one here I
know them all this is

But his sentence was never finishedit was Jimmie Dale on his feet
now leaning against the jamb of the door his automatic covering the
two men at the table who spoke

Quite so Isaac he said coolly you know them all Quite so
Isaacbut be good enough to DROP them

The case fell from Isaacs hand the flush on his cheeks died to a
sickly pallor and his mouth half open he stood like a man turned to
stone his hands with curved fingers still outstretched over the table
over the crimson gems that spilled from the case lay scattered now
on the tabletop Burton neither spoke nor moveda little whiter the
misery in his face almost apathetic he moistened his lips with the tip
of his tongue

Jimmie Dale walked across the room halted at the end of the table
and surveyed the two men grimly And then while one hand with revolver
extended rested easily on the table the other gathered up the stones
placed them in the case and the case in his pocket Jimmie Dales lips
parted in an uninviting smile

I guess Im in luck tonight eh Isaac he drawled Between you and
your young friend as I believe you call him it would appear as though
I had fallen on my feet That Aracons worthwhat would you saya
hundred two hundred thousand alone eh A very famous stone thathad
your eye on it for quite a time Isaac you miserable blood leech eh

Isaac did not answer but while he still held back from the table he
seemed to be regaining a little of his composureburglars of whatever
sort were no novelty to himand was staring fixedly at Jimmie Dale

Cant place methough theres not many in the profession you dont
know Is that it inquired Jimmie Dale softly Well dont try Isaac
its hardly worth your while IVE got the stones now and

Wait Wait Listen It was Burton speaking for the first time his
words coming in a quick nervous rush Listen You dont

Hold your tongue cried old Isaac with sudden fierceness You are a
fool He leaned toward Jimmie Dale a crafty smile on his face quite
in control of himself once more Dont listen to himlisten to me
Youre right I cant place you and it doesnt make any differencehe
took a step forwardbut

Not too close Isaac snapped Jimmie Dale sharply I know YOU

So ejaculated old Isaac rubbing his hands together So That is
good That is what I want Listen we will make a bargain We are birds
of a feather eh All thieves eh Youve got the drop on us who did all
the work but youll give us our shareeh Listen You couldnt get rid
of those stones alone You know that youre not so green at the game
eh Youd have to go to some one You know me you know old Isaac you
say Well then you know there isnt another man in New York could
dispose of those rubies and play SAFE doing it except me Ill make a
good bargain with you

Isaac said Jimmie Dale pensively youve made a good many good
bargains I wonder when youll make your last Theres more than one
looking for interest on those bargains in a pretty grim sort of way

Bah ejaculated old Isaac It is an old story They are all alike I
am afraid of none of them I hold them all likeTHAT His hand opened
and closed like a taloned claw

And youd add me to the lot eh said Jimmie Dale He lifted the
revolver its muzzle on old Isaac examined the mechanism thoughtfully
and lowered it again Very well Ill make a bargain with
youproviding it is agreeable to your young friend here

Ah exclaimed old Isaac shrilly So That is good It is done then
He chuckled hoarsely Any bargain I make he will agree to Is it not
so He fixed his eyes on Burton Well is it not so Speak up Say

He stoppedthe words cut short off on his lips It came without
warninga crash a pound on the door belowanother

Burton shrank back against the wall

My God The police he gasped Maddons found out Werewere
caught

Jimmie Dales eyes on old Isaac narrowed The pounding in the alleyway
grew louder more insistent And then his first suspicion passedit
was no game of Isaacs Crafty though the old fox was the others
surprise and agitation was too genuine to be questioned

Still the pounding continuedsome one was kicking viciously at the
door and banging a tattoo on the panels with his fists

Old Isaacs clawlike hands doubled suddenly

It is some drunken sot he snarled out that knows no better than to
come here and rouse the whole neighbourhood It is true in a moment we
will have the police running in from the street But waitwaitIll
teach the fool a lesson He dashed around the table ran for the
window wrenched the catch up flung the window open and snarling
again leaned outand instantly the knocking ceased

And instantly then with a sharp cry as the whole ghastly meaning of it
swept upon him Jimmie sprang after the othertoo late Came the
roar of a revolver shot a stream of flame cutting the darkness of the
alleyway from the window in the house oppositeand without a sound
old Isaac crumpled up hung limply for a moment over the sill and slid
in a heap to the floor

On his hands and knees protected from the possibility of another bullet
by the height of the sill Jimmie Dale quick in every movement now
dragged the inert form toward the table away from the window and bent
hurriedly over the other A minute perhaps he stayed thereand then
rose slowly

Burton horrorstricken unmanned beside himself was hanging
clutching with both hands at the table edge

Hes dead said Jimmie Dale laconically

Burton flung out his hands

Dead he whispered hoarsely II think Im going mad Three days of
helland now this Wedwed better get out of here quicktheyll get
us if

Jimmie Dales hand fell with a tight grip on Burtons shoulder

There wont be any more shots firedpull yourself together

Burton stared at him in a demented way

Whatswhats it mean he stammered

It means that I didnt put two and two together said Jimmie Dale a
little bitterly It means that theres a dozen crooks been dancing
old Isaacs tune for a long timeand that some of them have got him at
last

Burton reached out suddenly and clutched Jimmie Dales arm

Then Im safe He mumbled the words but there was dawning hope
relief in his white face Safe Im safeif youll only give me back
those stones Give them back to me for Gods sake give them back to me
You dont knowyou dont understand I stole them becausebecause he
made mebecause Iit was the only chance I had Oh my God you dont
know what the last three days have been Give them back to me wont
youwont you Youyou dont know

Dont lose your nerve said Jimmie Dale sharply Sit down He pushed
the other into the chair Theres no one will disturb us here for some
time at least What is it that I dont know That three nights ago
you were in a gambling hell Sagostos to be exact one of the most
disreputable in New Yorkand you went there on the invitation of a
stray acquaintance a man named Perleyshall I describe him for you A
short slimbuilt man black eyes red hair beard and

YOU know that The misery the hopelessness was back in Burtons face
againand suddenly he bent over the table and buried his head in his
outflung arms

There was silence for a moment Tightlipped Jimmie Dales eyes
travelled from Burtons shaking shoulders to the motionless form on the
floor Then he spoke again

Youre a bit of a rounder Burton but I think youve had a lesson that
will last you all your life You were halfdrunk when you and Perley
began to hobnob over a downtown bar He said hed show you some real
life and you went with him to Sagostos He gave you a revolver before
you went in and told you the place wasnt safe for an unarmed man He
introduced you to Sagosto the proprietor and you were shown to a
back room You drank quite a little there You and Perley were alone
throwing dice You got into a quarrel Perley tried to draw his
revolver You were quicker You drew the one he had given youand
fired He fell to the flooryou saw the blood gush from his breast just
above the hearthe was dead In a panic you rushed from the place and
out into the street I dont think you went home that night

Burton raised his head showing his haggard face

I guess its no use he said dully If you know others must I
thought only Isaac and Sagosto knew Why havent I been arrested I wish
to God I hadI wouldnt have had today to answer for

I am not through yet said Jimmie Dale gravely The next day old
Isaac here sent for you He said Sagosto had told him of the murder and
had offered to dispose of the corpse and keep his mouth shut for fifty
thousand dollarsthat no one in his place knew of it except himself
Isaac for his share wanted considerably more You told him you had no
such sums that you had no money He told you how you could get ityou
had access to Maddons safe you were Maddons confidential
secretary fully in your employers trust the last man on earth to be
suspectedand there were Maddons famous priceless rubies

Jimmie Dale paused Burton made no answer

And so said Jimmie Dale presently to save yourself from the death
penalty you took them

Yes said Burton scarcely above his breath Are you an officer If
you are take me have done with it Only for Heavens sake end it If
youre not

Jimmie Dale was not listening The cupboard at the rear of the room
she had said He walked across to it now opened it and after a little
search found a small bundle He returned with it in his hand and
kneeling beside the dead man on the floor his back to Burton untied
it took out a red wig and beard and slipped them on to old Isaacs
head and face

I wonder he said grimly as he stood up if you ever saw this man
before

My GodPERLEY With a wild cry Burton was on his feet straining
forward like a man crazed

Yes said Jimmie Dale Perley Sort of an ironic justice in his end
as far as you are concerned isnt there I think well leave him like
thatas Perley It will provide the police with an interesting little
problemwhich they will never solve andSTEADY

Burton was rocking on his feet the tears were streaming down his face
He lurched heavilyand Jimmie Dale caught him and pushed him back into
the chair again

I thoughtI thought there was blood on my hands said Burton brokenly
thatthat I had taken a mans life It was horrible horrible Ive
lived through three days that I thought would drive me mad while II
tried to do my work andand talk to people just as if nothing had
happened And every one that spoke to me seemed so carefree and happy
and I would have sold my soul to have changed places with them He
stared at the form on the floor and shivered suddenly Itit was like
that I saw him last he whispered Butbut I do not understand

Jimmie Dale smiled a little wearily

It was simple enough he said Old Isaac had had his eyes on those
rubies for a long time The easiest way of getting them was through you
The revolver he gave you before you entered Sagostos was loaded with
blank cartridges the blood you saw was the old old tricka punctured
bladder of red pigment concealed under the vest

Let us get out of here Burton shuddered again Let us get out of
hereat oncenow If were found here well be accused ofTHAT

There is no hurry Jimmie Dale answered quietly I have told you that
no one is liable to come here tonightand whoever did this certainly
will not raise an alarm And besides there is still the matter of the
rubiesBurton

Yes said Burton with a quick intake of his breath

Yesthe rubieswhat are you going to do with them II had forgotten
them Youll He stopped stared at Jimmie Dale and burst into a
miserable laugh Im a fool a blind fool he moaned It does not
matter what you do with them I forgot Sagosto When they find Isaac
here Sagosto will either tell his story which will be enough to
convict me of this nights work the REAL murder even though Im
innocent or else hell blackmail me just as Isaac did

Jimmie Dale shook his head

You are doing Isaacs cunning an injustice he said grimly Sagosto
was only a tool one of many that old Isaac had in his powerand for
that matter as likely as any one else to have had a hand in Isaacs
murder tonight Sagosto saw you once when Isaac brought you into his
placenot because Isaac wanted Sagosto to see you but because he
wanted YOU to see Sagosto Do you understand It would make the story
that Sagosto came to him with the tale of the murder the next day ring
true Sagosto however did not go to old Isaac the next day to tell
about any fake murdernaturally Sagosto would not know you again
from Adamneither does he know anything about the rubies nor what old
Isaacs ulterior motives were He was paid for his share in the game in
old Isaacs usual manner of payment probablyby a threat of exposure
for some oldtime offence that Isaac held over him if he didnt keep
his mouth shut

Burtons hand brushed his eyes

Yes he muttered YesI see it now

Jimmie Dale stooped down picked up the paper from the floor in which
the wig and beard had been wrapped walked back with it and replaced
it in the cupboard And then with his back to Burton again he took
the case of gems from his pocket opened it and laid it on the cupboard
shelf Also from his pocket came that thin metal case and from the
case with a pair of tweezers that obviated the possibility of telltale
finger prints a gray diamondshaped piece of paper adhesive on
one side that cursed by the distracted authorities in every police
headquarters on both sides of the Atlantic and raved at by a virulent
press whose printed reproductions had made it familiar in every
household in the landwas the insignia of the Gray Seal He moistened
the adhesive side dropped it from the tweezers to his handkerchief and
pressed it down firmly on the inside of the cover of the jewel case He
put both cases back in his pockets and returned to Burton

Burton he said a little sharply while I was outside that doorway
there I heard you beg old Isaac to let you keep the rubies and three
times already you have asked the same of me What would you do with them
if I gave them back to you

Burton did not reply for a momenthe was gazing at the masked face in a
halfeager halfdoubtful way

Youyou mean you will give them back he burst out finally

Answer my question prompted Jimmie Dale

Do with them Burton repeated slowly Why Ive told you Theyd go
back to Mr MaddonId take them back

Would you Jimmie Dales voice was quizzical

A puzzled expression came to Burtons face

I dont know what you mean by that he said Of course I would

How asked Jimmie Dale Do you know the combination of Mr Maddons
safe

No said Burton

And the safe would be locked wouldnt it

Yes

Quite so said Jimmie Dale musingly Then granted that Mr Maddon
has not already discovered the theft how would you replace the stones
before he does discover it And if he already knows that they are gone
how would you get them back into his hands

Yes I know Burton answered a little listlessly Ive thought of
that Theres only one wayto take them back to him myself and make a
clean breast of it and He hesitated

And tell him you stole them supplied Jimmie Dale

Burton nodded his head Yes he said

And then prodded Jimmie Dale What will Maddon do From what Ive
heard of him hes not a man to trifle with nor a man to take an overly
complacent view of thingsnot the man whose philosophy is alls well
that ends well

What does it matter Burtons voice was low It isnt that so much
Im ready for that Its the fact that he trusted me implicitly and
Iwell I played the fool or Id never have got into a mess like
this

For an instant Jimmie Dale looked at the other searchingly and then
smiling strangely he shook his head

Theres a better way than that Burton he said quietly

I think as I said before youve had a lesson tonight that will last
you all your life Im going to give you another chancewith Maddon
Here are the stones He reached into his pocket and laid the case on
the table

But now Burton made no effort to take the casehis eyes in that
puzzled way again were on Jimmie Dale

A better way he repeated tensely What do you mean What way

Well say at the expense of another mans reputationof mine
suggested Jimmie Dale with his whimsical smile You need only say that
a man came to you this evening told you that he stole these rubies from
Mr Maddon during the afternoon and asked you as Mr Maddons private
secretary to restore them with his compliments to their owner

A slow flush of disappointment deepening to one of anger dyed Burtons
cheeks

Are you trying to make a fool of me he cried out Go to Maddon with
a childish tale like that Theres no man living would believe such a
cockandbull story

No inquired Jimmie Dale softly And yet I am inclined to think there
are a good manythat even Maddon would hardheaded as he is You
might say that when the man handed you the case you thought it was some
practical joke being foisted on you until you opened the caseJimmie
Dale pushed it a little farther across the table and Burton
mechanically his eyes still on Jimme Dale loosened the catch with his
thumb nailuntil you opened the case saw the rubies and

The Gray Seal Burton had snatched the case toward him and was
straining his eyes at the inside cover Youthe Gray Seal

Well said Jimmie Dale whimsically

Motionless the case held open in his hands Burton stood there

The Gray Seal he whispered Then with a catch in his voice You
mean this You mean to let me have these backyou meanyou mean all
youve said For Gods sake dont play with methe Gray Seal the most
notorious criminal in the country to give back a fortune like this
Youyou

Dog with a bad name said Jimmie Dale with a wry smile then a
little gruffly Put it in your pocket

Slowly almost as though he expected the case to be snatched back from
him the next instant Burton obeyed

I dont understandI CANT understand he murmured They say that
youand yet I believe you nowyouve saved me from a ruined life
tonight The Gray Seal Ifif every one knew what you had done
they

But every one wont Jimmie Dale broke in bluntly Who is to tell
them You You couldnt very well when you come to think of itcould
you Well who knows perhaps there have been others like you

You mean said Burton excitedly you mean that all these crimes of
yours that have seemed without motive that have been so inexplicable
have really been like tonight to

I dont mean anything at all interposed Jimmie Dale a little
hurriedly Nothing Burtonexcept that there is still one little thing
more to do to bolster up that childish story of mineand then get
out of here He glanced sharply critically around the room his eyes
resting for a moment at the last on the form on the floor Then tersely
I am going to turn out the lightwe will have to pass the window to
get to the door and we will invite no chances Are you ready

No not yet said Burton eagerly I havent said what Id like to say
to you what I

Walk straight to the door said Jimmie Dale curtly There was the
click of an electriclight switch and the room was in darkness Now
no noise he instructed

And Burton perforce made his way across the roomand at the door
Jimmie Dale joined him and led him down the short flight of stairs At
the bottom he opened the door leading into the rear of the pawnshop
itself and bidding Burton follow entered

We cant risk even a match it could be seen from the street he said
brusquely as he fumbled around for a moment in the darkness Ahhere
it is He lifted a telephone receiver from its hook and gave a number

Burton caught him quickly by the arm

Good Lord man what are you doing he protested anxiously Thats
Mr Maddons house

So I believe said Jimmie Dale complacently Hello Is Mr Maddon
there    I beg pardon    Personally yes if you please

There was a moments wait Burtons hand was still nervously clutching
at Jimmie Dales sleeve Then

Mr Maddon asked Jimmie Dale pleasantly Yes    I am very sorry
to trouble you but I called you up to inquire if you were aware that
your rubies and among them your Aracon had been stolen    I beg
pardon    Rubiesyes    You werent    Oh no I am quite
in my right mind if you will take the trouble to open your safe you
will find they are goneshall I hold the line while you investigate
   What    Dont shout pleaseand stand a little farther away
from the mouthpiece Jimmie Dales tone was one of insolent composure
now There is really no use in getting excited    I beg pardon   
Certainly this is the Gray Seal speaking    What Jimmie Dales
voice grew plaintive I really cant make out a word when you yell like
that    Yes    I had occasion to use them this afternoon and I
took the liberty of borrowing them temporarilyare you still there Mr
Maddon    Oh quite so Yes I hear you NOW    No that is
all only I am returning them through your private secretary a very
estimable young man though I fear somewhat excitable and shaky who is
on his way to you with them now    WHATS THAT YOU SAY You repeat
that snapped Jimmie Dale suddenly icily and Ill take them
from under your nose again before morning    Ah That is better
GoodnightMr Maddon

Jimmie Dale hung up the receiver and shoved Burton toward the door

Now then Burton well get out of herand the sooner you reach Fifth
Avenue and Mr Maddons house the better No not that way They had
reached the hall and Burton had turned toward the side door that opened
on the alleyway Whoever they were who settled their last account with
Isaac may still be watching Theyve nothing against any one else
but they know some one was in here at the time and if the police
are clever enough ever to get on their track they might find it
very convenient to be able to say WHO was in the room when Isaac was
murderedtheres nothing to show since Isaac so obligingly opened the
window for them that the shot was fired THROUGH the window and not from
the inside of the room And even if they have already taken to their
heelsJimmie Dale was leading Burton up the stairs again as he
talkedit might prove exceedingly inconvenient for us if some
passerby should happen to recollect that he saw two men of our general
appearance leaving the premises Now keep closeand follow me

They passed the door of Isaacs den turned down a narrow corridor that
led to the rear of the houseJimmie Dale guiding unerringly working
from the mental map of the house that the Tocsin had drawn for
himdescended another short flight of stairs that gave on the kitchen
crossed the kitchen and Jimmie Dale opened a back door He paused here
for a moment to listen then cautioning Burton to be silent moved on
again across a small back yard and through a gate into a lane that
ran at right angles to the alleyway by which both had entered the
houseand a minute later they were crouched against a building a
half block away where the lane intersected the cross street

Here Jimmie Dale peered out cautiously There was no one in sight He
touched Burtons shoulder and pointed down the street

Thats your way Burtonmines the other Hurry while youve got the
chance Goodnight

Burtons hand reached out caught Jimmie Dales and wrung it

God bless you he said huskily I

And Jimmie Dale pushed him out on to the street

Burtons steps receded down the sidewalk Jimmie Dale still crouched
against the wall The steps grew fainter in the distance and died
finally away Jimmie Dale straightened up slipped the mask from his
face to his pocket stepped out on the streetand five minutes later
was passing through the noisy bedlam of the Hungarian restaurant on his
way to the front door and his car

SONNEZ LE TOCSIN Jimmie Dale was saying softly to himself I wonder
what shell do when she finds Ive got the ring



CHAPTER VIII

THE MAN HIGHER UP


The Tocsin By neither act sign nor word had she evidenced the
slightest interest in that ringand yet she must know she certainly
must know that it was now in his possession Jimmie Dale was
disappointed Somehow he had counted more than he had cared to admit on
developments from that ring

He pulled a little viciously at his cigarette as he stared out of the
St James Club window That was how long ago Ten days Yes this would
be the eleventh Eleven days now and no word from hereleven days since
that night at old Isaacs since she had last called him the Gray Seal
to arms It was a long whileso long a while even that what had come
to be his prerogative in the newspapers the front page with threeinch
type recounting some new exploit of that mysterious criminal the Gray
Seal was being usurped The papers were howling now about what they
for the lack of a better term were pleased to call a wave of crime that
had inundated New York and of which for once the Gray Seal was not
the storm centre but rather for the moment forgotten

He drew back from the window and settling himself again in the big
leather lounging chair resumed the perusal of the evening paper His
eye fell on what was common to every edition now a crime editorialand
the paper crackled suddenly under the long slim tapering fingers
so carefully nurtured whose sensitive tips a hundred times had made
mockery of the human ingenuity squandered on the intricate mechanism
of safes and vaults No he was wrongthe Gray Seal had not been
forgotten

We should not be surprised wrote the editor virulently to discover
at the bottom of these abominable atrocities that the guiding spirit
in fact was the Gray Sealthey are quite worthy even of his diabolical
disregard for the laws of God and man

Jimmie Dales lips straightened ominously and an angry glint crept into
his dark steady eyes There was nothing then nothing too vile that
in the publics eyes could not logically be associated with the Gray
Sealeven this A series of the most coldblooded callous murders
and robberies the work on the face of it of a wellorganized band
of thugs brutal insensate little better than fiends though clever
enough so far to have evaded capture clever enough indeed to have
kept the police still staggering and gasping after a clew for one
murderwhile another was in the very act of being committed The Gray
Seal What exquisite irony And yet after all the papers were not
wholly to blame for what they said he had invited much of it Seeming
crimes of the Gray Seal had apparently been genuine beyond any question
of doubt as he had intended them to appear as in the very essence of
their purpose they had to be

Yes he had invited muchhe and she togetherthe Tocsin and himself
He Jimmie Dale millionaire clubman whose name for generations in
New York had been the family pride was wanted as the Gray Seal for so
many crimes that he had lost track of them himselfbut from any one
of which let the identity of the Gray Seal be once solved there was
and could be no escape What exquisite ironyyet full too of the most
deadly consequences

Once more Jimmie Dales eyes sought the paper and this time scanned the
headlines of the first page


BRUTAL MURDER OF MILL PAYMASTER

THE CRIME WAVE STILL AT ITS HEIGHT

HERMAN ROESSLE FOUND DEAD NEAR HIS CAR

ASSASSINS ESCAPE WITH 20000


Jimmie Dale read onand as he read there came again that angry set to
his lips The details were not pleasant Herman Roessle the paymaster
of the MartindaleKensington Mills whose plant was on the Hudson had
gone that morning in his runabout to the nearest town three miles away
for the monthly pay roll had secured the money from the bank a sum of
twentyodd thousand dollars and had started back with it for the
mill At first it being broad daylight and a wellfrequented road his
nonappearance caused no apprehension but as early afternoon came and
there was still no sign of Roessle the mill management took alarm
Discovering that he had left the bank for the return journey at a few
minutes before eleven and that nothing had been seen of him at his
home the police were notified Followed then several hours of fruitless
search until finally with the whole countryside aroused and the
efforts of the police augumented by private search parties the car was
found in a thicket at the edge of a crossroad some four miles back from
the river and a little way from the car the body of Roessle dead
the mans head crushed in where it had been fiendishly battered by some
blunt heavy object There was no clewno one could be found who had
seen the car on the crossroadthe murderer or murderers and the
twentyodd thousand dollars in cash had disappeared leaving no trace
behind

There were several columns of this which Jimmie Dale skimmed through
quickly but at the end he stared for a long time at the last paragraph
Somehow strange to relate the paper had neglected to turn its sob
artist loose and the few words added almost as though they were
an afterthought for once rang true and full of pathos in their very
simplicityat the Roessle home where Mrs Roessle was prostrated
two little tots of five and seven too young to understand had gravely
received the reporter and told him that some bad man had hurt their
daddy

Mr Dale sir

Jimmie Dale lowered his paper A club attendant was standing before him
respectfully extending a silver card tray From the man Jimmie Dales
eyes fixed on a white envelope on the tray One glance was enoughit
was HERS that letter The Tocsin again His brain seemed suddenly to be
afire and he could feel his pulse quicken the blood begin to pound
in fierce throbs at his heart Life and death lay in that white
innocentlooking unaddressed envelope danger perilit was always
life and death for those were the stakes for which the Tocsin played
But master of many things Jimmie Dale was most of all master of
himself Not a muscle of his face moved He reached nonchalantly for the
letter

Thank you said Jimmie Dale

The man bowed and started away Jimmie Dale laid the envelope on the
arm of the lounging chair The man had reached the door when Jimmie Dale
stopped him

Oh by the way said Jimmie Dale languidly where did this come
from

Your chauffeur sir replied the other Your chauffeur gave it to the
hall porter a moment ago sir

Thank you said Jimmie Dale again

The door closed

Jimmie Dale glanced around the room It was the caution of habit that
glance the habit of years in which his life had hung on little things
He was alone in one of the clubs private library rooms He picked up
the envelope tore it open took out the folded sheets inside and began
to read At the first words he leaned forward suddenly tense in his
chair He read on turning the pages hurriedly incredulity amazement
and finally a strange menace mirroring itself in turn upon his face

He stood upthe letter in his hand

My God whispered Jimmie Dale

It was a call to arms such as the Gray Seal had never received
beforesuch as the Tocsin had never made before And if it were true
itTrue He laughed aloud a little gratingly True Had the Tocsin
astounding unbelievable mystifying as were the means by which she
acquired her knowledge not only of this but of countless other affairs
ever by so much as the smallest detail been astray If it were true

He pulled out his watch It was halfpast nine Benson his chauffeur
had sent the letter into the club Benson had been waiting outside
there ever since dinner Jimmie Dale for the first time since the
first communication that he had ever received from the Tocsin did not
immediately destroy her letter now He slipped it into his pocketand
stepped quickly from the room

In the cloakroom downstairs he secured his hat and overcoat and
though it was a warm evening put on the latter since he was in evening
clothes then walked leisurely out of the club

At the curb Benson the chauffeur sprang from his seat and touching
his cap opened the door of a luxurious limousine

Jimmie Dale shook his head

I shall not keep you waiting any longer Benson he said You may
take the car home and put it up I shall probably be late tonight

Very good sir replied the chauffeur

You sent in a letter a moment or so ago Benson observed Jimmie Dale
casually opening his cigarette case

Yes sir said Benson I hope I didnt do wrong sir He said it was
important and that you were to have it at once

He Jimmie Dale was lighting his cigarette now

A boy sir Benson amplified I couldnt get anything out of him He
just said hed been told to give it to me and tell me to see that you
got it at once I hope sir I havent

Not at all Benson said Jimmie Dale pleasantly Its quite all
right Goodnight Benson

Goodnight sir Benson answered climbing back to his seat

There was a queer little smile on Jimmie Dales lips as he watched the
great car swing around in the street and glide noiselessly awaya queer
little smile that still held there even after he himself had started
briskly along the avenue in a downtown direction It was invariably the
same always the samethe letters came unexpectedly when least
looked for now by this means now by that but always in a manner that
precluded the slightest possibility of tracing them to their source Was
there anything in his intimate surroundings in his intimate life
that she did not know about himwho knew absolutely nothing about her
Benson for instancethat the man was absolutely trustworthyor else
she would never for an instant have risked the letter in his possession
Was there anything that she did notyes one thingshe did not know
him in the role he was going to play tonight That at least was one
thing that surely she did not know about him the role in which many
times for weeks on end he had devoted himself body and soul in an
attempt to solve the mystery with which she surrounded herself the
role too that often enough had been a bulwark of safety to him when
hard pressed by the police the role out of which he had so carefully
so painstakingly created a now recognised and wellknown character of
the underworldthe role of Larry the Bat

Jimmie Dale turned from Fifth Avenue into Broadway continued on down
Broadway across to the Bowery kept along the Bowery for several more
blocksand finally headed east into the dimly lighted cross street on
which the Sanctuary was located

And now Jimmie Dale became cautious in his movements As he approached
the black alleyway that flanked the miserable tenement he glanced
sharply behind and about him and at the alleyway itself without
pause but with a curious lightninglike side step no longer Jimmie
Dale now but the Gray Seal he disappeared from the street and was
lost in the deep shadows of the building

In a moment he was at the side door listening for any sound from
withinnone had ever seen or met the lodger or the first floor either
ascending or descending except in the familiar character of Larry
the Bat He opened the door closed it behind him and in the utter
blackness went noiselessly up the stairsstairs so rickety that it
seemed a mouses tread alone would have set them creaking There seemed
an art in the play of Jimmie Dales every muscle in the movements
lithe balanced quick absolutely silent On the first landing he
stopped before another door there was the faint click of a key turning
in the lock and then this door too closed behind him Sounded the
faint click of the key as it turned again and Jimmie Dale drew a long
breath stepped across the room to assure himself that the window blind
was down and lighted the gas jet

A yellow murky flame spurted up pitifully weak almost as though it
were ashamed of its disreputable surroundings Dirt disorder squalour
the evidence of low living testified eloquently enough to any one
the police for instance in times past inquisitive until they were
fatuously content with the belief that they knew the occupant for what
he was that the place was quite in keeping with its tenant a mute
prototype as it were of Larry the Bat the dope fiend

For a little space Jimmie Dale immaculate in his evening clothes
stood in the centre of the miserable room his dark eyes keen alert
critical sweeping comprehensively over every object about himthe
position of a chair of a cracked drinking glass on the brokenlegged
table of an old coat thrown with apparent carelessness on the floor at
the foot of the bed of a broken bottle that had innocently strewn some
sort of white powder close to the threshold inviting unwary foot tracks
across the floor And then taking out the Tocsins letter he laid it
upon the table placed what money he had in his pockets beside it and
began rapidly to remove his clothes The Sanctuary had not been invaded
since his last visit there

He turned back the oilcloth in the far corner of the room took up the
piece of loose flooring which however strangely enough fitted
so closely as to give no sign of its existence even should it
inadvertently by some curious visitor again be trod upon and from the
aperture beneath lifted out a bundle of clothes and a small box

Undressed now he carefully folded the clothes he had taken off laid
them under the flooring and began to dress again his wardrobe supplied
by the bundle he had taken out in exchangean old pair of shoes the
laces broken mismated socks patched trousers frayed at the bottoms a
soiled shirt collarless open at the neck Attired to his satisfaction
he placed the box upon the table propped up a cracked mirror sat down
in front of it and with a deft artists touch began to apply stain
to his hands wrists neck throat and facebut the hardness the grim
menace that now grew into the dominant characteristic of his features
was not due to the stain alone

Dear Philanthropic Crookhis eyes were on the Tocsins letter that
lay before him He read onfor once even to Jimmie Dales keen facile
mind a first reading had failed to convey the full significance of what
she had written It was too amazing almost beyond beliefthe series of
crimes rampant for the past few weeks at which the community had
stood aghast the brutal murder of Roessle but a few hours old lay bare
before his eyes It was all there all of it the details the hellish
cleverness the personnel even of the thugs all everythingexcept the
proof

Get him Jimmiethe man higher up Get him Jimmiebefore another
pays forfeit with his lifethe words seemed to leap out at him from
the white page in red dancing linesGet himJimmiethe man higher
up

Jimmie Dale finished the second reading of the letter read it again
for the third time then tore it into tiny fragments His fingers delved
into the box again and the transformation of Jimmie Dale member of New
Yorks most exclusive social set into a low viciousfeatured denizen
of the underworld went ona little wax applied skilfully behind the
ears in the nostrils and under the upper lip

It was all thereall except the proof And the proofhe laughed aloud
suddenly unpleasantly There seemed something sardonic in it ay more
than that all that was grim in irony The proof in Stangeists own
writing sworn to before witnesses in the presence of a notary the
text of the document of course unknown to both witnesses and notary
evidence absolute and final that would be admitted in any court for
Stangeist was a lawyer and would see to that was in Stangeists own
safe for Stangeists own protectionStangeist who was himself the
head and brains of this murder gangStangeist who was the man higher
up

It was amazing without parallel in the history of crimeand yet
ingenious clever full of the craft and cunning that had built up the
shyster lawyers reputation below the dead line

Jimmie Dales lips were curiously thin now So it was Stangeist A
Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde with a vengeance He knew Stangeistnot
personally not by the reputation Stangeist held low even as that was
among his brother members of the profession but as the man was known
for what he really was among the crooks and criminals of the underworld
where in that strange underground exchange whispered confidences
passed between those whose common enemy was the law where Larry the Bat
himself was trusted in the innermost circles

Stangeist was a power in the Bad Lands There were few among that unholy
community that Stangeist at one time or another in one way or another
had not rescued from the clutches of the law resorting to any trick or
cunning but with perjury that he could handle like the master of
it that he was employed as the most common weapon of defence for his
clientsprovided he were paid well enough for it The man had become
more than the attorney for the crime worldhe had become part of
it Cunning shrewd crafty conscienceless coldbloodedthat was
Stangeist

The form and features of the man pictured themselves in Jimmie Dales
mindthe sixfoot muscular frame that was invariably clothed in attire
of the most fashionable cut the thin lips with their oily plausible
smile the straight black hair that straggled into pin point little
black eyes the dark face with its high cheek bones which with the
pronounced aquiline nose and the persistent rumour that he was a
quarter caste had led the underworld prejudiced always in favour of a
monaker to dub the man the Indian Chief

Jimmie Dale laughed againstill unpleasantly So Stangeist had taken
the plunge at last and branched out into a wider field had he Well
there was nothing surprising in thatexcept that he had not done it
before The irony of it lay in the fact that at last he had been TOO
clever overstepped himself in his own cleverness that was all It was
Australian Ike The Mope and Clarie Deane that Stangeist had gathered
around him the Tocsin had saidand there were none worse in Larry the
Bats wide range of acquaintanceship than those three Stangeist had
made himself master of Australian Ike The Mope and Clarie Deaneand
he had driven them a little too hard on the division of the spoilsand
laughed at them and cracked the whip much after the fashion that the
trainer in the cage handles the growling beasts around him

A dozen of the crimes that had appalled and staggered New York they had
committed under his leadership and then it seemed they had quarrelled
furiously the three pitted against Stangeist threatening him
demanding a more equitable share of the proceeds None was better aware
than Stangeist that threats from men of their calibre were likely to
result in a grim aftermathand Stangeist yesterday the Tocsin said
had answered them as no other man than Stangeist would either have
thought of or have dared to do One by one at separate times covering
the other with a revolver Stangeist had permitted them to read
a document that was addressed to the district attorney It was a
confession complete in every detail of every crime the four together
had committed implicating Stangeist as fully and unreservedly as it
did the other three It required no commentary If anything happened
to Stangeist a stab in the dark for instance a bullet from some dark
alleyway a blackjack deftly wielded as only Australian Ike The Mope
or Clarie Deane knew how to wield itthe document automatically became
a DEATH SENTENCE for Australian Ike The Mope and Clarie Deane

It was very simpleand evidently it had been effective as witness
the renewal of their operations in the murder of Roessle that afternoon
Fear and avarice had both probably played their part fear of the man
who would with such consummate nerve fling his life into the balance
to turn the tables upon them while he jeered at them avarice that
prompted them to get what they could out of Stangeists brains and
leadership and to be satisfied with what they COULD getsince they
could get no more

Satisfied Jimmie Dale shook his head No that was hardly the
wordcowed perhaps for the moment would be better But afterward
with a document like that in existence when they would never be safe
for an instantwell beasts in the cages had been known to get the
better of the man with the whip and beasts were gentle things compared
with Australian Ike The Mope and Clarie Deane Some day they would
reverse the tables on the Indian Chiefif they could And if they
couldnt it would not be for the lack of trying

There would be another act in that drama of the House Divided before the
curtain fell And there would be a sort of grim poetic justice in it a
temptation almost to let the play work itself out to its own inevitable
conclusion onlyJimmie Dale the final touches given to his features
stood up and his hands clenched suddenly fiercelyit was not just the
man higher up alone there were the other three as well the whole
four of them all of them crimes without number at their door brutal
fiendish acts damnable outrages murder to answer for with which the
public now was beginning to connect the name of the Gray Seal The Gray
Seal

Jimmie Dales hands whose delicate fingers were artfully grimed and
blackened now beneath the nails clenched still tighterand then with
a quick shrug of his shoulders a thinning of the firmly compressed
lips he picked up the coat from where it lay upon the floor put it on
put the money that was on the table in his pocket and replaced the box
under the flooring

In quick succession from the same hiding place an automatic a black
silk mask an electric flashlight that thin metal box like a cigarette
case and a half dozen viciouslooking little bluedsteel burglars
tools were stowed away in his pockets the flooring carefully replaced
the oilcloth spread back again and then pulling a slouch hat well down
over his eyes he reached up to turn off the gas

For an instant his hand held there while his eyes sweeping around the
apartment took in every single detail about him in that same alert
comprehensive way as when he had enteredthen the room was in darkness
and the Gray Seal as Larry the Bat a shuffling unkempt creature
of the underworld alias Jimmie Dale the lionised of clubs the
matrimonial target of exclusive drawingrooms closed the door of the
Sanctuary behind him shuffled down the stairs shuffled out into the
lane and shuffled along the street toward the Bowery

A policeman on the corner accosted him familiarly

Hello Larry grinned the officer

Ello returned Jimmie Dale affably through the side of his mouth
Fine night aint itand shuffled on along the street

And now Jimmie Dale began to hurrystill with that shuffling tread but
covering the ground nevertheless with amazing celerity He had lost
no time since receiving the Tocsins letter it was true but for all
that it was now after ten oclock Stangeists house was dark that
evening she had said meaning that the occupants Stangeist as well
as whatever servants there might be for Stangeist had no family were
outthe servants in town for a theatre or picture show probablyand
Stangeist himself as yet not back presumably from that Roessle affair
The stub of an old cigar unlighted shifted with a sudden savage twist
of the lips from one side of Jimmie Dales mouth to the other There was
need for haste There was no telling when Stangeist might get backas
for the servants that did not matter so much servants in suburban
homes had a marked affinity for last trains

Jimmie Dale boarded a crosstown car effected a transfer and in
a quarter of an hour after leaving the Sanctuary was huddled an
inoffensive heap like a tiredout workingman in a corner seat of a
Long Island train From here there was only a short run ahead of him
and twenty minutes later descending from the train at Forest Hills he
had passed through the more thickly settled portion of the little place
and was walking briskly out along the country road

Stangeists house lay approximately a mile and a half from the
station quite by itself and set well back from the road Jimmie Dale
could have found it with his eyes blindfoldedthe Tocsins directions
had lacked none of their usual explicit minuteness The road was quite
deserted Jimmie Dale met no one Even in the houses that he passed the
lights were in nearly every instance already out

Something merciless in its rage swept suddenly over Jimmie Dale as
unbidden of its own volition the last paragraph he had read in that
evenings paper began to repeat itself over and over again in his mind
The two little kiddiesit seemed as though he could see them standing
thereand from Jimmie Dales lips not given to profanity there came
a bitter oath It might possibly be that even if he were successful in
what was before him tonight the authors of the Roessle murder would
never be known That confession of Stangeists was written prior to what
had happened that afternoon and there would be no mention naturally
of Roessle And for a moment that seemed to Jimmie Dale the one thing
paramount to all others the one thing that was vital then he shook
his head and laughed out shortly After all it did not matterwhether
Stangeist and the blood wolves he had gathered around him paid the
penalty specifically for one particular crime or for another could make
little differencethey would PAY just as surely just as certainly
once that paper was in his possession

Jimmie Dale was counting the houses as he passedthey were more
infrequent now farther apart Stangeist was no foolnot the fool that
he would appear to be for keeping a document like that once he had had
the temerity to execute it in his own safe for in a day or two the
Tocsin had hinted at this after holding it over the heads of Australian
Ike The Mope and Clarie Deane again to drive the force of it a little
deeper home he would undoubtedly destroy itand the SUPPOSITION that
it was still in existence would have equally the same effect on the
minds of the other three Stangeist was certainly alive to the peril
that he ran with such a thing in his possession only the peril had not
appealed to him as imminent either from the three thugs with whom he had
allied himself or much less from any one else that was all

Jimmie Dale halted by a low ornamental stone fence some three feet
high and stood there for a moment glancing about him This was
Stangeists househe could just make out the building as it loomed up a
shadowy irregular shape perhaps two hundred yards back from the fence
The house was quite dark not a light showed in any window Jimmie Dale
sat down casually on the fence looked carefully again up and down
the roadthen swinging his legs over quick now in every action he
dropped to the other side and stole silently across the grass to the
rear of the house

Here he stopped again reached up to a window that was about on a level
with his shoulders and tested its fastenings The windowit was the
window of Stangeists private sanctum according to the plan in
her letterwas securely locked Jimmie Dales hands went into his
pocketand the black silk mask was slipped over his face He listened
intentlythen a little steel instrument began to gnaw like a rat

A minute passedtwo of them Again Jimmie Dale listened There was not
a sound save the night soundsthe light breeze whispering through
the branches of the trees the faroff rumble of a train the whir of
insects the hoarse croaking of a frog from some nearby creek or pond
The window sash was raised an inch another and gradually to the top
Like a shadow Jimmie Dale pulled himself up to the sill and poised
there his hand parted the heavy portieres that hung within It was too
dark to distinguish even a single object in the room He lowered himself
to the floor and slipped cautiously between the portieres

From somewhere in the house a clock began to strike Jimmie Dale
counted the strokes Eleven oclock It was getting lateTOO late
Stangeist was likely to be back at any moment The flashlight in Jimmie
Dales hand now circled the room with its little round white ray
lingering an instant in a queer inquisitive sort of way here and there
on this object and thatand went out Jimmie Dale noddedthe flat desk
in the centre of the floor the safe in the corner by the rear wall the
position of everything in the room even to the chairs was photographed
on his mind

He stepped from the portieres to the safe and the flashlight played
againthis time reflecting back from the glistening nickelled knobs
Jimmie Dales lips tightened It was a small safe almost ludicrously
small but to such height as the art of safe design had been carried
that design was embodied in the one before him

Type KfourtwoeightColby muttered Jimmie Dale A nasty little
beggarand its eleven oclock now Id use soup for once if it
werent that it would put Stangeist wise and give him a chance to make
his getaway before the district attorney got the nippers on the four of
them

The light went out Jimmie Dale dropped to his knees and while his
left hand passed swiftly tentatively over dials and handle he rubbed
the fingers of his right hand rapidly to and fro over the carpet
Wonderful finger tips were those of Jimmie Dale sensitive to an
abnormal degree and now tingling with the friction the nerves
throbbing at the skin surface they closed in a light delicate touch
upon the knob of the dialand Jimmie Dales ear pressed close against
the face of the safe

Time passed The silence grew heavyseemed to palpitate through the
room Then a deep breath half like a sigh half like a fluttering sob
as of a strong man taxed to the uttermost of his endurance came from
Jimmie Dale and his left hand swept away the sweat beads that had
spurted to his forehead

Eightthirteentwentytwo whispered Jimmie Dale

There was a click a low metallic thud as the bolts slid back and the
door swung open

And now the flashlight again searching the mechanism of the inner
doorthen darkness once more

Five minutes ten minutes went by The clock struck againand the
single stroke seemed to boom out through the house in a weird raucous
threatening note and seemed to linger throbbing in the air

The inner door was openthe flashlights ray was flooding a nest
of pigeonholes and little drawers The pigeonholes were crammed with
papers as presumably too were the drawers Jimmie Dale sucked in his
breath He had already been there well over half an hourevery minute
now every second was counting against him and to search that mass of
papers before Stangeist returned was

Ahit came in a fierce little ejaculation from Jimmie Dale From
the centre pigeonhole almost the first paper he had touched he drew
a long sealed envelope and at a single swift glance had read the
inscription upon it written in longhand


TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY NEW YORK CITY

IMPORTANT URGENT


The words in the corners were underscored three times

Swiftly deftly Jimmie Dales hands rolled the rounded end of one of
his collection of the legal instruments under the flap of the envelope
turned the sheets over and drew out the folded document inside There
were eight sheets of legal foolscap neatly fastened together at the top
lefthand corner with green tape He opened them out read a few words
here and there and turned the pages hurriedly over to scrutinise
the last oneand nodded grimly Three witnesses had testified to the
signature of Stangeist and a notarys seal accompanied by the usual
legal formula was duly affixed

Jimmie Dale slipped the document into his pocket and with the envelope
in his hand moved to the desk He opened first one drawer and then
another and finally discovering a pile of blank foolscap took out four
sheets folded them and placed them in the envelope sealing the
flap of the latter again That it did not seal very well now brought a
quizzical twitch to Jimmie Dales lips Sealed or unsealed perhaps it
made little difference but for all that he was not through with it
yet Apart from bringing the four to justice there was after all a
chance to vindicate the Gray Seal in this matter at least and repudiate
the newspaper theory which the public to whom the Gray Seal was already
a monster of iniquity would seize upon with avidity

There was no further need of light now Jimmie Dale replaced the
flashlight in his pocket took out the thin metal case opened it and
with the tiny pair of tweezers that likewise nestled there lifted out
one of the gray diamondshaped paper seals There was no question but
that once under arrest Stangeists effects would be immediately
and thoroughly searched by the authorities Jimmie Dales smile from
quizzical became ironic It would afford the police another little
bewildering reminder of the Gray Seal and give Carruthers good old
Carruthers of the MORNING NEWSARGUS so innocently ignorant that the
Gray Seal was his old college pal yet the one editor of them all who
was not forever barking and yelping at the Gray Seals heels a chance
to vindicate himself a little too Jimmie Dale moistened the adhesive
side of the gray seal and still mindful of telltale finger prints
laid it with the tweezers on the flap of the envelope and pressed it
firmly into place with his elbow

And then suddenly every faculty instantly on the alert he snatched up
the envelope from the desk and listened Was it imagination a trick
of nerves orno there it was againa footfall on the gravel walk at
the front of the house The sound became louder clearertwo footfalls
instead of one It was Stangeist and somebody was with him

In an instant Jimmie Dale was across the room and kneeling again before
the safe His fingers were flying now The envelope shot back into the
pigeonhole from which he had taken itthe inner door of the safe closed
silently and swiftly

A dry chuckle came from Jimmie Dales lips It was just like fiction
just precisely time enough to have accomplished what he had come for
before he was interrupted not a second more or less the villain foiled
at the psychological moment The key was rattling in the front door
nowthey were in the hallhe could hear Stangeists voicethere came
a dull glow from the hallway following the click of an electriclight
switch The outer door of the safe swung shut the bolts slid into
place the dial whirled under Jimmie Dales fingers It was only a
step to the portieres the open windowand escape He straightened up
stepped back the portieres closed behind himand the chuckle died on
Jimmie Dales lips

He was trappedcaught without so much as a corner in which to turn
Stangeist was even then coming into the roomand OUTSIDE darkly
outlined two forms stood just beneath the window Instinctively quick
as a flash Jimmie Dale crouched below the sill Who were they What did
it mean Questions swept in swift sequence through his brain Had they
seen him It would be very dark against the background of the portieres
but yet if they were watchinghe drew a breath of relief He had not
been seen Their voices reached him in low guarded whispers

Say youse Ike pipe it Deres a window open in the snitchs room
Come on well get in dere Itll make the hair stand up on the back of
his neck fer a starter

Aw ferget it replied another voice Can the teeayter stunt
Clarie leaves the front door unfastened dont he An deyll be in dere
in a minute now Wotcher want ter do Crab the game He might hear us
an fix Clarie before we had a chanst the skinny old fox An deres
the light nowsee Beat it on yer toes fer the front of the house

The room was flooded with light Through the portieres that Jimmie Dale
parted by the barest fraction of an inch he could see Stangeist and
another man a thickset uglyfacedlooking customerClarie Deane
according to that brief whispered colloquy that he had heard outside
He looked again through the window The two dark forms had disappeared
now but they had disappeared just a few seconds too latewith the two
other men now in the room and one of them so close that Jimmie Dale
could almost have reached out and touched him it was impossible to
get through the window without being detected when the slightest sound
would attract instant attention and equally instant suspicion It was a
chance to be taken only as a last resort

Jimmie Dales face grew hard as his fingers closed around his automatic
and drew the weapon from his pocket It was all plain enough That last
act in the drama which he had speculatively anticipated was being staged
with little loss of timeand in a grim sort of way the thought flashed
across his mind that perilous as his own position was Stangeist at
that moment was in even greater peril than himself Australian Ike The
Mope and Clarie Deane given the chance and they seemed to have made
that chance now were not likely to deal in half measuresClarie Deane
had dropped into a chair beside the desk and The Mope and Australian
Ike were creeping around to the front door

The parting in the portieres widened a little more a very little more
slowly imperceptibly until Jimmie Dale by the simple expedient of
moving his head could obtain an unobstructed view of the entire room

Stangeist tossed a bag he had been carrying on the desk pulled up a
chair opposite to Clarie Deane and sat down Both men were side face to
Jimmie Dale

You tell the boys said Stangeist abruptly to fade away after this
for a while Things are getting too hot And you tell The Mope I dock
him five hundred for that extra crunch on Roessles skull That sort
of thing isnt necessary Thats the kind of stunt that gets the public
sorethe man was dead enough as it was See

Sure Clarie Deanes ejaculation was a grunt

Stangeist opened the bag and dumped the contents on the deskpile
after pile of banknotes the pay roll of the MartindaleKensington
Mills

Some haul observed Clarie Deane with a hoarse chuckle The papers
said over twenty thousand

You cant always believe what the papers say returned Stangeist
curtly and taking a scribbling pad from the desk began to check up
the packages

Clarie Deanes cigar had gone out He rolled the short stub in his
mouth and leaned forward

The bills were evidently just as they had been delivered to the murdered
paymaster at the bank done up with little narrow paper bands in
packages of one hundred notes each save for a small bundle of loose
bills which latter with the rolls of silver Stangeist swept to one
side of the desk

Package by package Stangeist went on jotting the amounts down on the
pad

Nix growled Clarie Deane suddenly Cut that out Thems fivers in
that wad Make that five hundred instead of oneIm onter yer

Mistake said Stangeist suavely changing the figures with his pencil
Youre pretty wide awake for this time of night arent you Clarie

Oh I dunno responded Clarie Deane gruffly Not so very

Stangeist finished with the packages picked up the loose bills and
with a short laugh tossed them into the bag and followed them with the
rolls of silver He pushed the bag toward Clarie Deane

Thats a little extra for you he said The trouble with you fellows
is that you dont know when youre well offbut the sooner you find it
out the better unless you want another lesson like yesterday He made
the addition on the pad Fifteen thousand eight hundred dollars he
announced softly Thats seven thousand nine hundred for the three of
you to divide less five hundred from The Mope

Clarie Deanes eyes narrowed His hands were on his knees hidden by the
desk

Theres moren twenty there he said sullenlyand drew a match across
the under edge of the desk with a long crackling noise

Stangeists face lost its suavity a snarl curled his lips but about
to reply he sprang suddenly to his feet instead his head turned
sharply toward the door

Whats that he said hoarsely Its not the servants they wouldnt
dare to

Stangeists words ended in a gulp He was staring into the muzzle of a
heavycalibered revolver that Clarie Deane had jerked up from under the
desk

You sit down or Ill blow your block off said Clarie Deane with a
sudden leer

It happened then almost before Jimmie Dale could grasp the details
before even Clarie Deane himself could interfere The door burst open
two men rushed inand one with a bound flung himself at Stangeist
The mans hand grasping a clubbed revolver rose in the air descended
on Stangeists headand Stangeist went down in a limp heap crashed
into the chair and slid from the chair with a thud to the floor

There was an oath from Clarie Deane He jumped from his seat and with a
violent shove sent the man reeling half across the room

Blast you Mope he snarled Youre too blamed fly Dye wanter queer
the whole biz

Aw wots the matter wid youse The Mope purplefaced with rage
little black eyes glittering mouth working under a flattened nose that
some previous encounter had broken and bent over the side of his face
advanced belligerently

Australian Ike who had entered the room with him pulled him back

Ferget it he flung out Claries dealin the deck Ferget it

The Mope glared from one to the other then shook his fist at Stangeist
on the floor

Youse two make me sick he sneered Wots the use of waitin all
night We was to bump him off anyway wasnt we Dats wot youse said
yerselves cause wot was ter stop him writin out another paper if we
didnt fix him fer keeps

Thats all right rejoined Clarie Deane but thats the second act
you bonehead see We aint got the paper yet have we Say take a look
at that safe Its easier ter scare him inter openin it than ter crack
it aint it

Jimmie Dale from his crouched position began to rise to his feet
slowly making but the slightest movement at a time cautious of the
least sound His lips were like a thin line his fingers tightly pressed
over the automatic in his hand There was not room for him between the
portieres and the window and do what he could the hangings bulged a
little Let one of the three notice that or inadvertently brush against
the portieres and his life would not be worth an instants purchase

They were lifting Stangeist up now propping him up in the chair
Stangeist moaned opened his eyes stared in a dazed way at the three
faces that leered into his then dawning intelligence came and his
face that had been white before took on a pasty grayish pallor

Youthe three of you he mumbled Whats this mean

And then Clarie Deane laughed in a low brutal way

Wot dye think it means We want that paper an we want it damn
quicksee Dye think we was goin ter stand fer havin a trip ter Sing
Sing an the wire chair danglin over our heads

Stangeist closed his eyes When he opened them again something of the
oldtime craftiness was in his face

Well what are you going to do about it he inquired almost sharply
You know what will happen to you if anything happens to me

Dont youse kid yerself retorted Clarie Deane Dye think were
fools This aint like it was yesterdaysee We GETS the paper this
timeso there wont nothin happen to us You come across with it
blasted quick now or The Mopell give you another on the bean thatll
put you to sleep fer keeps

The blood was running down Stangeists face He wiped it away from his
eyes

Its not here he said innocently Its in my box in the
safetydeposit vaults

Aw blurted out Australian Ike pushing suddenly forward youse cant
work dat crawl on

Cut it out Ike snapped Clarie Dane Im runnin this So its in
the vaults eh He shoved his face toward Stangeists

Yes said Stangeist easily You seeI was looking for something like
this

Clarie Deanes fist clenched

You lie he choked The Mope here was the last of us you showed
the paper to yesterday afternoon an the vaults was closed thenan you
aint been there today cause youve been watched Thats why we fixed
it fer tonight after the divvy that youve just tried ter do us on
again cause we knew you had it here

I tell you its not here said Stangeist evenly

You lie said Clarie Deane again Its in that safe The Mope heard
you tell the girl in yer office that if anything happened to you she was
ter wise up the district attorney that there was a paper in your safe
at home fer him that was important Now then you beat it over ter that
safe an open it upwell give you a minute ter do it in

The papers not there I tell you said Stangeist once more

Thats all right submitted Clarle Deane grimly Theres a quarter of
that minute gone

I wont Stangeist flashed out violently

Thats all right repeated Clarie Deane Theres half of that minute
gone

Jimmie Dales eyes in a fascinated sort of way were on Stangeist The
mans face was twitching now moisture began to ooze from his forehead
as the callous brutality of the scowling faces seemed to get himand
then he lurched suddenly forward in his chair

My God he cried out a ring of terror in his voice What do you mean
to do Youll pay for it Theyll get you The servants will be back in
a minute

Two skirts jeered Clarie Deane We aint goin ter run away from
them If they comes before we goes well fix em That minutes up

Stangeist licked his lips with his tongue

Supposesuppose I refuse he said hoarsely

You can suit yerself said Clarie Deane with a vicious grin We know
the papers there an we gets it before we leaves heresee You can
take yer choice Either you goes over ter the safe an opens it yerself
or elsehe paused and produced a small bottle from his pocketthis
is nitroglycerin an we opens it fer you with this Only if we does
the job we does it proper We ties you up and sets you against the door
of the safe before we touches off the soup an mabbe if yer a good
guesser you can guess the rest

There was a short raucous guffaw from The Mope

Stangeist turned a drawn face toward the man stared at him and
stared in a miserable way at the other two in turn He licked his lips
againnone was in a better position than himself to know that there
would be neither scruples nor hesitancy to interfere with carrying out
the threat

Suppose he said trying to keep his voice steady suppose I open the
safewhat thenafterward

We aint got the safe open yet countered Clarie Deane
uncompromisingly An we aint got no more time ter fool over it
either You get a move on before I counts five or The Mope an Ike ties
you up One

Stangeist staggered to his feet wiped the blood out of his eyes for the
second time and with lips working went unsteadily across the room to
the safe

He knelt before it and began to manipulate the dial while the others
crowded around behind him The Mope was fingering his revolver again
club fashion Australian Ikes elbow just grazed the portieres and
Jimmie Dale flattened himself against the window holding his breatha
smile on his lips that was mirthless deadly cold The end was not far
off now and thenWHAT

Stangeist had the outer door of the safe open nowand now the inner
door swung back He reached in his hand to the pigeonhole drew out the
envelopeand with a sudden wild cry reeled to his feet

My God he screamed out Whatswhats this

Clarie Deane snatched the envelope from him

THE GRAY SEALthe words came with a jerk from his lips He ripped
the envelope open franticallyand like a man stunned gazed at the four
blank sheets while the colour left his face ITS GONE he cried out
hoarsely

Gone There was a burst of oaths from Australian Ike Gone Den were
nippedde lot of us

The Mopes face was like a maniacs as he whirled on Stangeist

Sure he croaked But youse gets yers first youse

With a cry Stangeist to elude the blow ducked blindly backwardinto
the portieresand with a rip and tear the hangings were wrenched apart

It came instantaneouslya yell of mingled surprise and fury from the
threethe crash and spit of Jimmie Dales revolver as he fired one shot
at the floor to stop their rushthen he flung himself at the window
through it and dropped sprawling to the ground

A stream of flame cut the darkness above him a bullet whistled by his
headanotherand another He was on his feet quick as a cat and
running close alongside of the wall of the house He heard a thud behind
him still another and yet a thirdthey were dropping through the
window after him Came another shot an angry hum of the bullet closer
than beforethen the pound of racing feet

Jimmie Dale swung around the corner of the house running at top speed
Something that was like a hot iron suddenly burned and seared along the
side of his head just above the ear He reeled staggered recovered
himself and dashed on It nauseated him that stinging in his head
and all at once seemed to be draining his strength away The shouts the
shots the running feet became like a curious buzzing in his ears It
seemed strange that they should have hit him that he should be wounded
If he could only reach the low stone wall by the road he could at least
make a fight for his life on the other side

Red streaks swam before Jimmie Dales eyes The wall was such a long way
offa yard or two was a very long way more to gothe weakness
seemed to be creeping up now even to numb his brain No here was the
wallthey hadnt hit him againhe laughed in a demented wayand
rolled his body over and fell to the other side

JIMMIE

The cry seemed to reach some inner consciousness revive him send the
blood whipping through his veins That voice It was herHERS The
Tocsin There was an automobile engine racing standing there in the
road He won to his feetdark rushing forms were almost at the wall
He firedoncetwicefired againand turned staggering for the car

Jimmie JimmieQUICK

Panting gasping he half fell into the tonneau The car leaped forward
yells filled the airbut only one thing was dominant in Jimmie Dales
reeling brain now He pulled himself up to his feet and leaned over the
back of the seat reaching for the slim figure that was bent over the
wheel

Its youyou at last he cried Your facelet me lee your face

A bullet split the back panel of the carlittle spurting flames were
dancing out from the roadway behind

Are you mad she shouted back at him Let me steerdo you want them
to hit me

Noo said Jimmie Dale in a queer singsong sort of way and his
head seemed to spin dizzily around NoI guess He choked The
paperits inmy pocketand he went down unconscious on the floor of
the car

When he recovered his senses he was lying on a couch in a plainly
furnished room and a man a stranger red jovialfaced farmerish
looking was bending over him

Where am I he demanded finally propping himself up on his elbow

Youre all right replied the man She said youd come around in a
little while

Who said so inquired Jimmie Dale

She did The woman who brought you here about five minutes ago She
said she ran you down with her car

Oh said Jimmie Dale He felt his headit was bandaged and it was
bandaged he was quite sure with a piece of torn underskirt He looked
at the man again You havent told me yet where I am

Long Island the other answered My names Hanson I keep a bit of a
truck garden here

Oh said Jimmie Dale again

The man crossed the room picked up an envelope from the table and came
back to Jimmie Dale

She said to give you this as soon as you got your senses and asked us
to put you up for a while as long as you wanted to stay and paid
us for it too Shes all right she is You dont want to hold the
accident up against her she was mighty sorry about it And now Ill go
and see if the old ladys got your room ready while youre readin your
letter

The man left the room

Jimmie Dale sat up on the couch and tore the envelope open The note
scrawled in pencil began abruptly


You were quite a problem I couldnt take you HOMEcould I I couldnt
take you to what you call the Sanctuary could I I couldnt take you to
a hospital nor call in a doctorthe stain you use wouldnt stand it
But thank God I know its only a flesh wound and you are all right
where you are for the day or two that you must keep quiet and take care
of yourself By the time you read this the paper will be on the way to
the proper hands and by morning the four where they should be There
were a few articles in your clothes I thought it better to take charge
of in casewell in case of ACCIDENT


Jimmie Dale tore the note up and smiled wryly at the door He felt
in his pockets Mask revolver burglars tools and the thin metal
insignia case were gone

And I had the sublime optimism murmured Jimmie Dale to spend months
trying to find her as Larry the Bat



CHAPTER IX

TWO CROOKS AND A KNAVE


The bullet wound along the side of his head and just above his ear would
have been a very awkward thing indeed in more ways than one for Jimmie
Dale the millionaire to have explained at his club in his social set
or even to his servants and of these latter to Jason the Solicitous
in particular but for Jimmie Dale as Larry the Bat it was a matter of
little moment There was none to question Larry the Bat save in a most
casual and indifferent way and a bandage of any description primarily
and above all one that he could arrange himself with only himself to
take note of the incongruous hues of skin where the stain the grease
paint and the makeup was washed off would excite little attention
in that world where daily affrays were commonplace happenings and a
wound for whatever reason had long since lost the tang of novelty Why
then should it arouse even a passing interest if Larry the Bat credited
as the most confirmed of dope fiends should have fallen down the
dark rickety stairs of the tenement in one of his orgies and in the
expressive language of the Bad Lands cracked his bean

And so Jimmie Dale had been forced to maintain the role of Larry the Bat
for a far longer period than he had anticipated when ten days before
he had assumed it for the nights work that had so nearly resulted
fatally for himself though it had placed Roessles murderers behind
the bars For the next day unwilling to court the risk of remaining
in that neighbourhood he had left Hansons the farmers house on
Long Island where the Tocsin had carried him in an unconscious state
telephoned Jason that he had been unexpectedly called out of town for
a few days and returned to the Sanctuary in New York And here to his
grim dismay he had found the underworld in a state of furious angry
unrest like a nest of hornets stirred up seeking to wreak vengeance
on an unseen assailant

For years as the Gray Seal Jimmie Dale had lived with the slogan of
the police The Gray Seal dead or alivebut the Gray Seal sounding
in his ears with the newspapers screaming their diatribes arousing
the people against him nagging the authorities into sleepless frenzied
efforts to trap him with a price upon his head that was large enough to
make a man not too pretentious rich for lifebut in the underworld
until then the name of the Gray Seal had been one to conjure with for
the underworld had sworn by the unknown master criminal and had
spoken his name with a reverence that was none the less genuine even if
pungently tainted with unholiness But now it was different Up and down
through the Bad Lands in gambling hells in vicious resorts in the
hiding places where thugs and crooks burrowed themselves away from
the daylight through the heart and the outskirts of the underworld
travelled the fiat whispered out of mouths crooked to one sideDEATH
TO THE GRAY SEAL

Gangland differences were forgotten in the larger issue of the common
weal The gang spirit became the spirit of a united whole and the crime
fraternity buzzed and hummed poisonously spurred on by hatred thirst
for revenge fear and perhaps most potent of all a hideous suspicion
now of each other

The underworld had received a shock at which it stood aghast and which
with its terrifying possibilities struck consternation into the soul
of every individual of that brotherhood whose bond was crime who was
already wanted for some offence or other whether it ranged from
murder in the first degree to some petty piece of sneak thievery
Stangeist the Indian chief the lawyer whose cunning brain had stood as
a rampart between the underworld and a prison cell was himself now in
the Tombs with the certainty of the electric chair before him and with
him the same fate equally assured were Australian Ike The Mope and
Clarie Deane Aristocrats of the Bad Lands peers of that inglorious
realm were those fourand the blow had fallen with stunning force
a blow that in itself would have been enough to have stirred the
underworld to its depths But that was not allfrom the cells in the
Tombs from the four came the word and passed from mouth to mouth in
that strange underground exchange until all had heard it that the Gray
Seal had SQUEALED The Gray Seal who though unknown they had counted
the most eminent among themselves had squealed Who was the Gray Seal
It he had held the secrets of Stangeist and his band what else might
he not know Who else might not fall next The Gray Seal had become
a snitch a menace a source of danger that stalked among them like a
ghastly spectre Who was the Gray Seal None knew

Death to the Gray Seal Run him to earth went the whisper from lip
to lip and with the whisper men stared uncertainly into each others
faces fearful that the one to whom they spoke might even bethe Gray
Seal

Jimmie Dales lips twisted queerly as he looked around him at the
squalid appointments of the Sanctuary The police were bad enough the
papers were worse but this was a still graver peril With every denizen
of the underworld below the dead line suspicious of each other their
lives the penitentiary or a prison sentence the stakes against which
each one played the role of Larry the Bat clever as was the makeup
and disguise was fraught now more than ever before with danger and
peril It seemed as though slowly the net was beginning at last to
tighten around him

The murky yellow flame of the gas jet flickered suddenly as though
in acquiescence with the quick impulsive shrug of Jimmie Dales
shouldersand Jimmie Dale bending to peer into the cracked mirror that
was propped up on the brokenlegged table knotted his dress tie almost
fastidiously The hair if just a trifle too long covered the scar on
his head now the wound no longer required a bandage and Larry the Bat
for the time being at least had disappeared Across the foot of the
bed neatly folded lay his dress coat and overcoat but little creased
for all that they had lain in that hidingplace under the flooring since
the night when hurrying from the club he had placed them there to
assume instead the tatters of Larry the Bat It was Jimmie Dale in his
own person again who stood there now in Larry the Bats disreputable
den an incongruous figure enough against the background of his
miserable surroundings in perfectfitting shoes and trousers the
broad expanse of spotless white shirt bosom glistening even in the
povertystricken flare from the single sputtering gas jet

Jimmie Dale took the watch from his pocket that had not been wound for
many days wound it mechanically set it by guessworkit was not far
from eight oclockand replaced it in his pocket Carefully then one
at a time he examined his fingers long slim sensitive tapering
fingers magical masters of safes and locks and vaults of the most
intricate and modern mechanismno single trace of grime remained
they were metamorphosed hands from the filthy paws of Larry the Bat He
nodded in satisfaction and picked up the mirror for a final inspection
of himself that this time did not miss a single line in his face or
neck Again Jimmie Dale nodded As though he had vanished into thin
air as though he had never existed not a trace of Larry the Bat
remainedexcept the heap of rags upon the floor the battered slouch
hat the frayed trousers the patched boots with their broken laces the
mismated socks the grimy flannel shirt and the old coat that he had
just discarded

The mirror was replaced on the table and pushing the heap of clothes
before him with his foot Jimmie Dale knelt down in the corner of the
room where the oilcloth had been turned up and the loose planking of the
floor removed and began to pack the articles away in the hole Jimmie
Dale rolled the trousers of Larry the Bat into a compact little bundle
and stuffed them under the flooring The gas jet seemed to blink again
in a sort of confidential approval as though the secret lay inviolate
between itself and Jimmie Dale Through the closed window shade tightly
drawn came low and muffled the sound of distant life from the Bowery
a few blocks away The gas jet suffering from air somewhere within the
pipes hissed angrily the yellow flame died to a little blue forked
spurtand Jimmie Dale was on his feet his face suddenly hard and white
as marble

SOME ONE WAS KNOCKING AT THE DOOR

For the fraction of a second Jimmie Dale stood motionless Found as
Jimmie Dale in the den of Larry the Bat and the consequences required
no effort of the imagination to picture them police or denizen of the
underworld who was knocking there it was all the same the method of
death would be a little different that was allone legalised the
other not Jimmie Dale Larry the Bat the Gray Seal once uncovered
could expect as much quarter as would be given to a cornered rat His
eyes swept the room with a swift critical glanceevidences of Larry
the Bat the clothes were still about even if he in the person of
Jimmie Dale alone damning enough were not standing there himself
And he was even weaponlessthe Tocsin had taken the revolver from
his pocket together with those other telltale articles the mask the
flashlight the little bluedsteel tools before she had intrusted him
that night wounded and unconscious to Hansons care

Jimmie Dale slipped his feet out of his low evening pumps snatched up
the old coat and hat from the pile put them on and without a
sound reached the gas jet and turned it off A second had gone byno
morethe knocking still sounded insistently on the door It was dark
now perfectly black He started across the room his tread absolutely
silent as the trained muscles relaxing threw the body weight gradually
upon one foot before the next step was taken It was like a shadow
a little blacker in outline than the surrounding blackness stealing
across the floor

Halfway to the door he paused The knocking had ceased He listened
intently It was not repeated Instead his ear caught a guarded step
retreating outside in the hall Jimmie Dale drew a breath of relief
He went on again to the door still listening Was it a trapthat step
outside

At the door now tense alert he lowered his ear to the keyhole There
came the faintest creak from the stairs Jimmie Dales brows gathered
It was strange The knocking had not lasted long Whoever it was was
going awaybut it required the utmost caution to descend those stairs
rickety and tumbledown as they were with no more sound than that
Why such caution Why not a more determined and prolonged effort at his
doorthe visitor had been easily satisfied that Larry the Bat was not
within TOO easily satisfied Jimmie Dale turned the key noiselessly in
the lock He opened the door cautiouslyhalf inchan inch there was
no sound of footsteps now Occasionally a lodger moved about on the
floor above occasionally from somewhere in the tenement came the murmur
of voices as from behind closed doorthat was all All else was silence
and darkness now

The door on its welloiled hinges swung wide open Jimmie Dale thrust
out his head into the halland something fell upon the threshold with
a little thudbut for a moment Jimmie Dale did not move Listening
trying to pierce the darkness he was as still as the silence around
him then he stooped and groped along the threshold His hand closed
upon what seemed like a small box wrapped in paper He picked it up
closed and locked the door again and retreated back across the room It
was strangeunpleasantly strangea box propped stealthily against the
door so that it would fall to the threshold when the door was opened
And why the stealth What did it mean Had the underworld with its
thousand eyes and ears already succeeded in a few days where the police
had failed signally for yearshad they sent him this whatever it was
as some grim token that they had run Larry the Bat to earth He shook
his head No gangland struck more swiftly with less finesse than
thatthe catandmouse act was never one it favoured for the mouse
had been known to get away

Jimmie Dale lighted the gas again and turned the package over in his
hands It was as he had surmised a small cardboard box and it was
wrapped in plain paper and tied with a string He untied the string
and still suspicious as a man is suspicious in the knowledge that he is
stalked by peril at every turn removed the wrapper a little gingerly
It was still without sign or marking upon it just an ordinary cardboard
box He lifted off the cover and with a short sudden laugh stared a
little out of countenance at the contents

On the top lay a white unaddressed envelope HERS Beneathhe emptied
the box on the tablehis black silk mask his automatic revolver the
kit of fine small bluedsteel burglars tools his pocket flashlight
and the thin metal insignia case The Tocsin Impulsively Jimmie Dale
turned toward the doorand stopped His shoulders lifted in a shrug
that meant to be philosophical was far from philosophical He could
not dared not venture far through the tenement dressed as he was and
even if he could there were three exits to the Sanctuary a fact that
now for the first time was not wholly a source of unmixed satisfaction
to him and besidesshe was gone

Jimmie Dale opened the letter a grim smile playing on his lips He had
forgotten for the moment that the illusion he had cherished for years
in the belief that she did not know Larry the Bat as an alias of
Jimmie Dale was no more thanan illusion Well it had been a piece of
consummate egotism on his part that was all But after all what did
it matter He had had his innings tried in the role of Larry the Bat
to solve her identity devoted weeks on end to the attemptand failed
Some day perhaps his turn would come some day perhaps she would no
longer be able to elude him unlessthe letter crackled suddenly in
his fingersunless the house that they had built on such strange
and perilous foundations crashed at some moment without an instants
warning in disaster and ruin to the ground Who knew but that this
letter now another call to the Gray Seal to act another peril invited
would be the LAST There must be an end some day luck and nerve had
their limitationsit had almost ended last week

There was more several pages of it explanations specific details down
to a minute description of the locality and plan of the house on the
Sound Jimmie Dale too intent now to mutter read on silently At the
end he shuffled the sheets a little abstractedly as his face hardened
Then his fingers began to tear the letter into little shreds tearing it
over and over again tearing the shreds into tiny particles He had not
been far wrong From what the night promised now this might well be the
last letter Who knew There would be need of all the wit and luck and
nerve tonight that the Gray Seal had ever had before

With a jerk Jimmie Dale roused himself from the momentary reverie into
which he had fallen and all action now stuffed the torn pieces of the
letter into his trousers pocket to be disposed of later in the street
took off the old coat and slouch hat again and resumed the disposal of
Larry the Bats effects under the flooring

This accomplished he replaced the planking and oilcloth stood up put
on his dress coat and light overcoat and from the table stowed the
black silk mask the automatic the little kit of tools the flashlight
and the thin metal case away in his pockets

Jimmie Dale raised his hand to the gas fixture circled the room with a
glance that missed no single detailthen the light went out the door
closed behind him locked a dark shadow crept silently down the stairs
out through the side door into the alleyway along the alleyway close to
the wall of the tenement where it was blackest and satisfied that
for the moment there were no passersby emerged on the street walking
leisurely toward the Bowery

Once well away from the Sanctuary however Jimmie Dale quickened his
steps and twenty minutes later having stopped but once to telephone to
his home on Riverside Drive for his touring car he was briskly mounting
the steps of the St James Club on Fifth Avenue Another twenty minutes
after that and he had dismissed Benson his chauffeur and at
the wheel of his big powerful machine was speeding uptown for the
PalaisMetropole Hotel

It was twelve minutes after nine when he drew up at the curb in front of
the side entrance of the hotelhis watch set by guesswork had been a
little slow and he had corrected it at the club He was replacing the
watch in his pocket as he sauntered around the corner and passed in
through the main entrance to the big lobby

Jimmie Dale avoided the elevatorsit was only one flight up and
elevator boys on occasions had been known to be observant At the top
of the first landing a long wide heavily carpeted corridor was before
him Number one hundred and fortyeight the corner room on the right
the Tocsin had said Jimmie Dale walked nonchalantly alongpast No
148 At the lower end of the hall a group of people were gathered around
the elevator doors halfway down the corridor a bell boy came out of a
room and went ahead of Jimmie Dale

And then Jimmie Dale stopped suddenly and began to retrace his steps
The group had entered the elevator the bell boy had disappeared around
the farther end of the hall into the wing of the hotelthe corridor
was empty In a moment he was standing before the door of No 148
in another under the persuasion of a little steel instrument deftly
manipulated by Jimmie Dales slim tapering fingers the lock clicked
back the door opened and he stepped inside closing and locking the
door again behind him

It was already a quarter past nine but no one was as yet in the
connecting roomthe fanlight next door had been dark as he passed His
flashlight swept about him located the connecting doorand went out
He moved to the door tried it and found it locked Again the little
steel instrument came into play released the lock and Jimmie Dale
opened the door Again the flashlight winked The door opened into a
bathroom that obviously at will was either common to the two rooms or
could by the simple expedient of locking one door or the other be used
by one of the rooms alone In the present instance the occupant of the
adjoining apartment had taken a room with a bath

Jimmie Dale passed through the bathroom to the opposite door This was
already threequarters open and swung outward into the bedroom near
the lower end of the room by the window Through the crack of the door
by the hinges Jimmie Dale flashed his light testing the radius of
vision pushed the door a few inches wider open tested it again with
the flashlightand retreated back into No 148 closing the door on his
side until it was just ajar

He stood there then silently waiting It was Hamverts room next door
and Hamvert and the Weasel were already late A step sounded outside in
the corridor Jimmie Dale straightened intently The step passed on
down the hallway and died away A false alarm Jimmie Dale smiled
whimsically It was a strange adventure this that confronted him quite
the strangest in a way that the Tocsin had ever plannedand the night
lay before him full of peril in its extraordinary complications To win
the hand he must block Hamvert and the Weasel without allowing them an
inkling that his interference was anything more than say the luck of
a hotel sneak thief at most The Weasel was a dangerous man one of the
slickest secondstory workers in the country with safe cracking as one
of his favourite pursuits a man most earnestly desired by the police
provided the latter could catch him with the goods As for Hamvert
he did not know Hamvert who was a stranger in New York except that
Hamvert had fleeced a man named Michael Breen out of his share in a
claim they had had together when Breen had first gone to Alaska to try
his luck and now having discovered that Breen when prospecting alone
somewhere in the interior a month or so ago had found a rich vein and
had made a map or diagram of its location he Hamvert had followed
the other to New York for the purpose of getting it by hook or crook
Breens find had been too late taken sick he had never worked his
claim had barely got back home before he died and only in time to hand
his wife the strange legacy of a roughly scrawled little piece of paper
andJimmie Dale straightened up alertly once more Steps againand
this time coming from the direction of the elevator then voices then
the opening of the door of the next room then a voice distinctly
audible

Pull up a chair and well get down to business Youre late as it is
We havent any time to waste if were going to wash paydirt tonight

Aw dats all right responded another voicequite evidently the
Weasels Dont youse worryde games cinched to a fadeaway

There was the sound of chairs being moved across the floor Jimmie Dale
slipped the black silk mask over his face opened the door on his side
of the bathroom cautiously and without a sound stepped into the
bathroom that was lighted now of course by the light streaming in
through the partially opened door of Hamverts room The two were
talking earnestly now in lower tones Jimmie Dale only caught a word
here and therehis faculties for the moment were concentrated on
traversing the bathroom silently He reached the farther door crouched
there peered through the crackand the old whimsical smile flickered
across his lips again

The PalaisMetropole was high class and exclusive and the Weasel for
once looked quite the gentleman and for all his sharp ferret face
not entirely out of keeping with his surroundingselse he would never
have got farther than the lobby The other was a short thickset
heavyjowled man with a great shock of sandy hair and small black eyes
that looked furtively out from overhanging bushy eyebrows

Well Hamvert was saying the details are your concern What I
want is results We wont waste time Youre to be back here by
daylightonly see that theres no comeback

Leave it to me returned the Weasel with assurance Hows dere
goin ter be any comeback Mittel keeps it in his safe dont he Well
gentlemens houses has been robbed beforean dis jobll be a good one
De geographfy stunt youse wants gets pinched wid de rest dats all It
disappearssee Whos ter know youse gets yer claws on it Its just
lost in de shuffle

Right agreed Hamvert brisklyand from his inside pocket produced
a package of crisp new bills yellowbacks and evidently of large
denominations Half down and half on deliverythats our deal

Dats wot assented the Weasel curtly

Hamvert began to count the bills

Jimmie Dales hand stole into his pocket and came out with his
handkerchief and the thin metal insignia case From the latter with its
little pair of tweezers he took out one of the adhesive gray seals
His eyes warily on the two men he dropped the seal on his handkerchief
restored the thin metal case to his pocketand in its stead the
blueblack ugly muzzle of his automatic peeped from between his fingers

Five thousand down said Hamvert pushing a pile of notes across the
table and tucking the remainder back into his pocket and the other
fives here for you when you get back with the map Ordinarily I
wouldnt pay a penny in advance but since you want it that way and
the maps no good to you while the rest of the long green is I He
swallowed his words with a startled gulp clutched hastily at the money
on the table and began to struggle up from his chair to his feet

With a swift noiseless sidestep through the open door Jimmie Dale was
standing in the room

Jimmie Dales tones were conversational Dont get up said Jimmie
Dale coolly And take your hand off that money

The Weasel whose back had been to the door squirmed around in his
chairand in his turn stared into the muzzle of Jimmie Dales revolver
while his jaw dropped and sagged

Goodevening Weasel observed Jimmie Dale casually I seem to be in
luck tonight I got into that room next door but an empty room is slim
picking And then it seemed to me I heard some one in here mention five
thousand dollars twice which makes ten thousand and which happens to
be just exactly the sum I need at the present momentif I cant get any
more I havent the honour of your wealthy friends acquaintance but
I am really charmed to meet him Youerunderstand both of you that
the slightest sound might prove extremely embarrassing

Hamverts face was white and he stirred uneasily in his chair but
into the Weasels face the first shock of surprised dismay past came
a dull angry red and into the eyes a vicious gleamand suddenly he
laughed shortly

Why youse damned fool jeered the Weasel dyouse tink youse can
get away wid dat Say take it from me youse are a piker Say youse
make me tired Wot dyouse tink youse are Dyouse tink dis is a
teeayter an dat youse are a cheapskate actor strollin acrost de
stage Aw beat it youse make me sick Why say youse pinch dat money
an youse have got de same chanst of gettin outer dis hotel as a guy
has of breakin outer Sing Sing By de time youse gets five feet from de
door of dis room we has de whole works on yer neck

Do you think so Weasel inquired Jimmie Dale politely He carried his
handkerchief to his mouth to cloak a coughand his tongue touched
the adhesive side of the little diamondshaped gray seal Hand and
handkerchief came back to the table and Jimmie Dale leaned his weight
carelessly upon it while the automatic in his right hand still covered
the two men Do you think so Weasel he repeated softly Well
perhaps you are right and yet somehow I am inclined to disagree with
you Let me see Weaselit was Tuesday night two nights ago wasnt
it that a trifling break in Maiden Lane at Thorold and Sons disturbed
the police It was a threeyear job for even a first offender ten
for one already on nodding terms with the police and fifteen to twenty
forwell say for a man like you WeaselIF HE WERE CAUGHT Am I
making myself quite plain

The colour in the Weasels cheeks faded a littlehis eyes were holding
in sudden fascination upon Jimmie Dale

I see that I am observed Jimmie Dale pleasantly I said if he were
caught you will remember I am going to leave this room in a moment
Weasel and leave it entirely to your discretion as to whether you will
think it wise or not to stir from that chair for ten minutes after
I shut the door And nowJimmie Dale nonchalantly replaced his
handkerchief in his pocket nonchalantly followed it with the banknotes
which he picked up from the tableand smiled

With a gasp both men had strained forward and were staring wildeyed
at the gray seal stuck between them on the tabletop

The Gray Seal whispered the Weasel and his tongue circled his lips

Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders

That WAS a bit theatrical Weasel he said apologetically and yet
not wholly unnecessary You will recall Stangeist The Mope Australian
Ike and Clarie Deane and can draw your own inference as to what might
happen in the Thorold affair if you should be so illadvised as to force
my hand Permit methe slim deft fingers like a streak of lightning
were inside Hamverts coat pocket and out again with the remainder of
the banknotesand Jimmie Dale was backing for the doornot the door
of the bathroom by which he had entered but the door of the room itself
that opened on the corridor There he stopped and his hand swept around
behind his back and turned the key in the locked door He nodded at the
two men whose faces were working with incongruously mingled expressions
of impotent rage bewilderment fear and furyand opened the door a
little Ten minutes Weasel he said gently I trust you will not
have to use heroic measures to restrain your friend for that length of
time though if it is necessary I should advise you for your own sake to
resort almostto murder I wish you good evening gentlemen

The door opened farther Jimmie Dale still facing inward slipped
between it and the jamb whipped the mask from his face closed the door
softly stepped briskly but without any appearance of haste along the
corridor to the stairs descended the stairs mingled with a crowd in
the lobby for an instant walked seemingly a part of it with a group
of ladies and gentlemen down the hall to the side entrance passed
outand a moment later after drawing on a linen dust coat which he
took from under the seat and exchanging his hat for a tweed cap the
car glided from the curb and was lost in a press of traffic around the
corner

Jimmie Dale laughed a little harshly to himself So far so goodbut
the game was not ended yet for all the crackle of the crisp notes in
his pocket There was still the map still the robbery at Mittels
housethe tenthousanddollar theft would not in any way change that
and it was a question of time now to forestall any move the Weasel might
make

Through the city Jimmie Dale alternately dodged spurted and dragged
his way fuming with impatience but once out on the country roads and
headed toward New Rochelle the big machine speed limits thrown to the
winds roared through the nighta gray streak of road jumping under the
powerful lamps a village a town a cluster of lights flashing by him
the steady purr of his sixtyhorsepower engines the gray thread of
open road again

It was just eleven oclock when Jimmie Dale the road to himself for the
moment at a spot a little beyond New Rochelle extinguished his lights
and very carefully ran his car off the road backing it in behind a
small clump of trees He tossed the linen dust coat back into the car
and set off toward where a little distance away the slap of waves from
the stiff breeze that was blowing indicated the shore line of the Sound
There was no moon and while it was not particularly dark objects and
surroundings at best were blurred and indistinct but that after all
was a matter of little concern to Jimmie Dalethe first house beyond
was Mittels He reached the waters edge and kept along the shore
There should be a little wharf she had said Yes there it wasand
there too was a gleam of light from the house itself

Jimmie Dale began to make an accurate mental note of his surroundings
From the little wharf on which he now stood a path led straight to the
house bisecting what appeared to be a lawn trees to the right the
house to the left At the wharf beside him two motor boats were
moored one on each side Jimmie Dale glanced at them and suddenly
attracted by the familiar appearance of one inspected it a little more
closely His momentarily awakened interest passed as he nodded his head
It had caught his attention that was allit was the same type and
design quite a popular make of which there were hundreds around New
York as the one he had bought that year as a tender for his yacht

He moved forward now toward the house the rear of which faced himthe
light that flooded the lawn came from a side window Jimmie Dale was
figuring the time and distance from New York as he crept cautiously
along How quickly could the Weasel make the journey The Weasel would
undoubtedly come and if there was a convenient train it might prove a
close racebut in his own favour was the fact that it would probably
take the Weasel quite some little time to recover his equilibrium from
his encounter with the Gray Seal in the PalaisMetropole also the
further fact that from the Weasels viewpoint there was no desperate
need of haste Jimmie Dale crossed the lawn and edged along in the
shadows of the house to where the light streamed out from what now
proved to be open French windows It was a fair presumption that he
would have an hour to the good on the Weasel

The sill was little more than a couple of feet from the ground and
from a crouched position on his knees below the window Jimmie Dale
raised himself slowly and peered guardedly inside The room was empty
He listened a momentthe black silk mask was on his face againand
with a quick agile silent spring he was in the room

And then in the centre of the room Jimmie Dale stood motionless
staring around him an expression ironical sardonic creeping into his
face THE ROBBERY HAD ALREADY BEEN COMMITTED At the lower end of the
room everything was in confusion the door of a safe swung wide the
drawers of a desk had been wrenched out even a liqueur stand on which
were wellfilled decanters had been broken open and the contents of
safe and desk the thiefs discards as it were littered the floor in
all directions

For an instant Jimmie Dale his eyes narrowed ominously surveyed the
scene then with a sort of professional instinct aroused he stepped
forward to examine the safeand suddenly darted behind the desk
instead Steps sounded in the hall The door openeda voice reached
him

The master said I was to shut the windows and I havent dast to go in
And hell be back with the police in a minute now Come on in with me
Minnie

Lord exclaimed another voice Aint it a good thing the missus is
away Shed have highsteericks

Steps came somewhat hesitantly across the floorfrom behind the desk
Jimmie Dale could see that it was a maid accompanied by a big rawboned
woman sleeves rolled to the elbows over brawny arms presumably the
Mittels cook

The maid closed the French windows there were no others in the room
and bolted them and having gained a little confidence gazed about
her

My but wasnt he cute she ejaculated Cut the telephone wires he
did And aint he made an awful mess But the master said we wasnt to
touch nothing till the police saw it

And to think of it happening in OUR house observed the cook heavily
her hands on her hips her arms akimbo Itll all be in the papers and
mabbe theyll put our pictures in too

I wont get over it as long as I live declared the maid The yell
Mr Mittel gave when he came downstairs and put his head in here
and then him shouting and using the most terrible language into
the telephone and then finding the wires cut And me following him
downstairs half dead with fright And he shouts at me Bella he
shouts shut those windows but dont you touch a thing in that room
Im going for the police And then he rushes out of the house

I was going to bed said the cook picking up her cue for what was
probably the twentieth rehearsal of the scene when I heard Mr Mittel
yell andLord Bella there he is now

Jimmie Dales hands clenched He too had caught the scuffle of
footsteps those of three or four men at least on the front porch
There was one way only one of escapethrough the French windows
It was a matter of seconds only before Mittel with the police at his
heels would be in the roomand Jimmie Dale sprang to his feet There
was a wild scream of terror from the maid echoed by another from the
cookand still screaming both women fled for the door

Mr Mittel Mr Mittel shrieked the maidshe had flung herself out
into the hall Heshes back again

Jimmie Dale was at the French windows tearing at the bolts They
stuck Shouts came from the front entryway He wrenched viciously at the
fastenings They gave now The windows flew open He glanced over his
shoulder A man Mittel presumably since he was the only one not in
uniform was springing into the room There was a blur of forms and
brass buttons behind Mitteland Jimmie Dale leaped to the lawn
speeding across it like a deer

But quick as he ran Jimmie Dales brain was quicker pointing the
single chance that seemed open to him The motor boat It seemed like a
Godgiven piece of luck that he had noticed it was like his own there
would be no blind and that meant fatal blunders in the dark over its
mechanism and he could start it up in a momentjust the time to cast
her off that was all he needed

The shouts swelled behind him Jimmie Dale was running for his life He
flung a glance backward One formMittel he was certainwas perhaps a
hundred yards in the rear The others were just emerging from the
French windowsgrotesque leaping things they looked in the light that
streamed out behind them from the room

Jimmie Dales feet pounded the planking of the wharf He stooped and
snatched at the mooring line Mittel was almost at the wharf It seemed
an age a year to Jimmie Dale before the line was clear Shouts rang
still louder across the lawnthe police racing in a pack were more
than halfway from the house He flung the line into the boat sprang in
after itand Mittel looming over him grasped at the boats gunwhale

Both men were panting from their exertions

Let go snarled Jimmie Dale between clenched teeth

Mittels answer was a hoarse gasping shout to the police to hurryand
then Mittel reeled back measuring his length upon the wharf from a blow
with a boat hook full across the face driven with a sudden untamed
savagery that seemed for the moment to have mastered Jimmie Dale

There was no timenot a secondnot the fraction of a second
Desperately frantically he shoved the boat clear of the wharf
Oncetwicethree times he turned the engine over without successand
then the boat leaped forward Jimmie Dale snatched the mask from his
face and jumped for the steering wheel The police were rushing out
along the wharf He could just faintly discern Mittel nowthe man was
staggering about his hands clapped to his face A peremptory order to
halt coupled with a threat to fire rang out sharplyand Jimmie Dale
flung himself flat in the bottom of the boat The wharf edge seemed to
open in little crackling jets of flame came the roar of reports like a
miniature battery in action then the FLOP FLOP FLOP as the lead tore
up the water around him the duller thud as a bullet buried its nose in
the boats side and the curious rip and squeak as a splinter flew Then
Mittels voice highpitched as though in pain

Cant any of you run a motor boat Hes got me bad Im afraid That
other one there is twice as fast

Sure another voice responded promptly And if thats right hes run
his head into a trap Cast loose there MacVeay and pile in all of
you You go back to the house Mr Mittel and fix yourself up Well
get him

Jimmie Dales lips thinned It was true If the other boat had any speed
at all it was only a question of time before he would be overtaken
The only point at issue was how much time It was darkthat was in his
favourbut it was not so dark but that a boat could be distinguished on
the water for quite a distance for a longer distance than he could hope
to put between them There was no chance of eluding the police that
way The keen facile brain that had saved the Gray Seal a hundred times
before was weaving planning discarding eliminating scheming a way
outwith death ruin disaster the price of failure His eyes swept
the dim irregular outline of the shore To his right in the opposite
direction from where he had left his car and perhaps a mile ahead as
well as he could judge the land seemed to run out into a point Jimmie
Dale headed for it instantly If he could reach it with a little lead to
the good there was a chance It would take say six minutes granting
the boat a speed of ten miles an hourand she could do that The others
could hardly overtake him in that timethey hadnt got started yet He
could hear them still shouting and talking at the wharf And Mittels
twice as fast was undoubtedly an exaggeration anyhow

A minute more passed anotherand then astern Jimmie Dale caught the
racket from the exhaust of a highpowered engine and a white streak
seemed to shoot out upon the surface of the water from where obscured
now he placed the wharf A quartermile lead roughly four hundred
yards yes he had as much as thatbut that too was very little

He bent over his engine coaxing it nursing it to its highest
efficiency his eyes strained now upon the point ahead now upon his
pursuers behind He was running with the wind thank Heaven or the
small boat would have had a further handicapit was rolling up quite a
sea

The steering gear he found was corded along the side of the boat
permitting its manipulation from almost any position and abruptly now
Jimmie Dale left the engine to rummage through the little locker in the
stern of the boat But as he rummaged his eyes held speculatively on
the boat astern She was gaining unquestionably steadily but not as
fast as he had feared He would still have a hundred yards lead at
least abreast the pointand he was smiling grimly now a hundred
yards there meant life to the Gray Seal The locker was full of a
heterogeneous collection of odds and endsa suit of oilskins tools
tins and cans of various sizes and descriptions Jimmie Dale emptied
the contents some sort of powder of a small round tin box overboard
and from his pocket took out the banknotes crammed them into the box
crammed his watch in on top of them and screwed the cover on tightly
His fingers were flying now A long strip torn from the trousers leg of
the oilskins was wrapped again and again around the boxand the box was
stuffed into his pocket

The flash of a revolver shot cut the blackness behind him then another
and another They were firing in a continuous stream again It was
fairly long range but there was always the chance of a stray bullet
finding its mark Jimmie Dale crouching low made his way to the bow of
the boat again

The point was looming almost abreast now He edged in nearer to hug
it as closely as he dared risk the depth of the water Behind
remorselessly the other boat was steadily closing the gap and the
shots were not all wildone struck with a curious singing sound on
some piece of metal a foot from his elbow Closer to the shore running
now parallel with the head of the point Jimmie Dale again edged in the
boat his jaws clamped working in little twitches

And then suddenly with a swift appraising glance behind him he
swerved the boat from her course and headed for the shorenot directly
but diagonally across the little bay that on the farther side of the
point had now opened out before him He was close in with the edge of
the point ten yards from it sweeping past itthe point itself came
between the two boats hiding them from each otherand Jimmie Dale
with a long spring dove from the boats side to the water

The momentum from the boat as he sank robbed him for an instant of all
control over himself and he twisted doubled up and rolled over and
over beneath the waterbut the next moment his head was above the
surface again and he was striking out swiftly for the shore It was
only a few yardsbut in a few SECONDS the pursuing boat too would
have rounded the point His feet touched bottom It was haste now
nothing else that counted The drum of the racing engines the
crackling roar of the exhaust from the oncoming boat was in his ears He
flung himself upon the shore and down behind a rock Around the point
past him tore the police boat dark forms standing clustered in the
bowand then a sudden shout

There she is See her Shes heading into the bay for the shore

Jimmie Dales lips relaxed There was no doubt that they had sighted
their quarry againa perfect fusillade of revolver shots directed at
the now empty boat was quite sufficient proof of that With something
that was almost a chuckle Jimmie Dale straightened up from behind the
rock and began to run back along the shore The little motor boat would
have grounded long before they overtook her and thinking naturally
enough that he had leaped ashore from her they would go thrashing
through the woods and fields searching for him

It was a longer way back by the shore a good deal longer now over
rough rocky stretches where he stumbled in the darkness now through
marshy sodden ground where he sank as in a quagmire time and again over
his ankles It was even longer than he had counted on and time with
the Weasel on one hand and the return of the police on the other was
a factor to be reckoned with again as a half hour later Jimmie Dale
stole across the lawn of Mittels house for the second time that night
and for the second time crouched beneath the open French windows

Masked again the water still dripping from what were once immaculate
evening clothes but which now sagged limply about him his collar a
pasty string around his neck the mud and dirt splashed to his knees
Jimmie Dale was a disreputable and incongruouslooking object as he
crouched there shivering uncomfortably from his immersion in spite of
his exertions Inside the room Mittel passed the windows pacing the
floor one side of his face badly cut and bruised from the blow with the
boat hookand as he passed his back turned for an instant Jimmie Dale
stepped into the room

Mittel whirled at the sound and with a suppressed cry instinctively
drew backJimmie Dales automatic was dangling carelessly in his right
hand

I am afraid I am a trifle melodramatic observed Jimmie Dale
apologetically surveying his own bedraggled person but I assure you
it is neither intentional nor for effect As it is I was afraid I would
be late Pardon me if I take the liberty of helping myself one gets a
chill in wet clothes so easilyhe passed to the liqueur stand poured
out a generous portion from one of the decanters and tossed it off

Mittel neither spoke nor moved Stupefaction surprise and a very
obvious regard for Jimmie Dales revolver mingled themselves in a
helpless expression on his face

Jimmie Dale set down his glass and pointed to a chair in front of the
desk

Sit down Mr Mittel he invited pleasantly It will be quite
apparent to you that I have not time to prolong our interview
unnecessarily in view of the possible return of the police at any
moment but you might as well be comfortable You will pardon me again
if I take another libertyhe crossed the room turned the key in the
lock of the door leading into the hall and returned to the desk Sit
down Mr Mittel he repeated a sudden rasp in his voice

Mittel none too graciously now seated himself

Look here my fine fellow he burst out youre carrying things with
a pretty high hand arent you You seem to have eluded the police for
the moment somehow but let me tell you I

No interrupted Jimmie Dale softly let ME tell youall there is
to be told He leaned over the desk and stared rudely at the bruise on
Mittels face Rather a nasty crack that he remarked

Mittels fists clenched and an angry flush swept his cheeks

Id have made it a good deal harder said Jimmie Dale with sudden
insolence if I hadnt been afraid of putting you out of business and
so precluding the possibility of this little meeting Now thenthe
revolver swung upward and held steadily on a line with Mittels eyes
Ill trouble you for the diagram of that Alaskan claim that belongs to
Mrs Michael Breen

Mittel staring fascinated into the little round black muzzle of the
automatic edged back in his chair

Soso thats what youre after is it he jerked out Wellhe
laughed unnaturally and waved his hand at the disarray of the
roomits been stolen already

I know that said Jimmie Dale grimly ByYOU

Me Mittel started up in his chair a whiteness creeping into his
face Me II

Sit down Jimmie Dales voice rang out ominously cold I havent any
time to spare You can appreciate that But even if the police return
before that map is in my possession they will still be TOO LATE as
far as you are concerned Do you understand Furthermore if I am
caughtyou are ruined Let me make it quite plain that I know
the details of your little game You are a curb broker Mr
Mittelostensibly In reality you run what is nothing better than an
exceedingly profitable bucket shop The Weasel has been a customer
and also a stool for you for years How Hamvert met the Weasel is
unimportanthe came East with the intention of getting in touch with a
slick crook to help himthe Weasel is the coincidence that is all I
quite understand that you have never met Hamvert nor Hamvert you nor
that Hamvert was aware that you and the Weasel had anything to do
with one another and were playing in togetherbut that equally is
unimportant When Hamvert engaged the Weasel for ten thousand dollars
to get the map from you for him the Weasel chose the line of least
resistance He KNEW you and approached you with an offer to split the
money in return for the map It was not a question of your accepting his
offerit was simply a matter of how you could do it and still protect
yourself The Weasel was well qualified to point the waya fake robbery
of your house would answer the purpose admirablyyou could not be held
either legally or morally responsible for a document that was placed
unsolicited by you in your possession if it were stolen from you

Mittels face was ashen colourless His hands were opening and shutting
with nervous twitches on the top of the desk

Jimmie Dales lips curled

ButJimmie Dale was clipping off his words now viciouslyneither
you nor the Weasel were willing to trust the other implicitlyperhaps
you know each other too well You were unwilling to turn over the map
until you had received your share of the money and you were equally
unwilling to turn it over until you were SAFE that is until you had
engineered your fake robbery even to the point of notifying the police
that it had been committed the Weasel on the other hand had some
scruples about parting with any of the money without getting the map in
one hand before he let go of the banknotes with the other It was very
simply arranged however and to your mutual satisfaction While you
robbed your own house this evening he was to get half the money in
advance from Hamvert giving Hamvert to understand that HE had planned
to commit the robbery himself tonight He was to come out here then
receive the map from you in exchange for your share of the money return
to Hamvert with the map and receive in turn his own share I might
say that Hamvert actually paid down the advanceand it was perhaps
unfortunate for you that you paid such scrupulous attention to details
as to cut your own telephone wires I had not of course an exact
knowledge of the hour or minute in which you proposed to stage your
little play here The object of my first visit a little while ago was
to forestall your turning the diagram over to the Weasel Circumstances
favoured you for the moment I am back again however for the same
purposethe map

Mittel in a cowed way was huddled back in his chair He smiled
miserably at Jimmie Dale

QUICK Jimmie Dale flung out the word in a sharp peremptory bark Do
you need to be told that the CARTRIDGES are dry

Mittels hand trembling went into his pocket and produced an envelope

Open it commanded Jimmie Dale And lay it on the desk so that I can
read itI am too wet to touch it

Mittel obeyedlike a dog that has been whipped

A glance at the paper and Jimmie Dales eyes lifted againto sweep the
floor of the room He pointed to a pile of books and documents in one
corner that had been thrown out of the safe

Go over there and pick up that check book he ordered tersely

What for Mittel made feeble protest

Never mind what for snapped Jimmie Dale Go and get itand HURRY

Once more Mittel obeyedand dropped the book hesitantly on the desk

Jimmie Dale stared silently insolently contemptuously at the other

Mittel stirred uneasily sat down shifted his feet and his fingers
fumbled aimlessly over the top of the desk

Compared with you said Jimmie Dale in a low voice the Weasel ay
and Hamvert too crooks though they are are gentlemen Michael Breen
as he died told his wife to take that paper to some one she could
trust who would help her and tell her what to do and knowing no one
to go to but because she scrubbed your floors and therefore thought
you were a fine gentleman she came timidly to you and trusted youyou
cur

Jimmie Dale laughed suddenlynot pleasantly Mittel shivered

Hamvert and Breen were partners out there in Alaska when Breen first
went out said Jimmie Dale slowly pulling the tin can wrapped in
oilskin from his pocket Hamvert swindled Breen out of the one strike
he made and Mrs Breen and her little girl back here were reduced to
poverty The amount of that swindle was I understand fifteen thousand
dollars I have ten of it here contributed by the Weasel and Hamvert
and you will I think recognise therein a certain element of poetic
justicebut I am still short five thousand dollars

Jimmie Dale removed the cover from the tin can Mittel gazed at the
contents numbly

You perhaps did not hear me prompted Jimmie Dale coldly I am still
short five thousand dollars

Mittel circled his lips with the tip of his tongue

What do you want he whispered hoarsely

The balance of the amount There was an ominous quiet in Jimmie
Dales voice A check payable to Mrs Michael Breen for five thousand
dollars

II havent got that much in the bank Mittel fenced stammering

No Then I should advise you to see that you have by ten oclock
tomorrow morning returned Jimmie Dale curtly Make out that check

Mittel hesitated The revolver edged insistently a little farther across
the deskand Mittel picking up a pen wrote feverishly He tore the
check from its stub and with a snarl pushed it toward Jimmie Dale

Fold it instructed Jimmie Dale in the same curt tones And fold
that diagram with it Put them both in this box Thank you He wrapped
the oilskin around the box again and returned the box to his pocket
And again with that insolent contemptuous stare he surveyed the man at
the deskthen he backed to the French windows It might be as well to
remind you Mittel he cautioned sternly that if for any reason this
check is not honoured whether through lack of funds or an attempt by
you to stop payment youll be in a cell in the Tombs tomorrow for this
nights workthat is quite understood isnt it

Mittel was on his feetsweat glistened on his forehead

My God he cried out shrilly Who are you

And Jimmie Dale smiled and stepped out on the lawn

Ask the Weasel said Jimmie Daleand the next instant lost in the
shadows of the house was running for his car



CHAPTER X

THE ALIBI


DEATH TO THE GRAY SEALthrough the underworld in dens and dives that
sheltered from the law the vultures that preyed upon society prompted
by selffear by secret dread by reason of their very inability
to carry out their purpose the whispered sentence grew daily more
venomous more insistent THE GRAY SEAL DEAD OR ALIVEBUT THE GRAY
SEAL It was the standing orders of the police Railed at by a
populace who angrily demanded at its hands this criminal of criminals
mocked at and threatened by a virulent press stung to madness by the
knowledge of its own impotence flaunted impudently to its face by this
mysterious Gray Seal to whose door the law laid a hundred crimes for
whom the bars of a death cell in Sing Sing was the certain goal could
he but be caught the police to a man was like an uncaged beast that
flicked to the raw by some unseen assailant and murderous in its fury
was crouched to strike Grim paradoxa common bond that linked the
hands of the law with those that outraged it

Death to the Gray Seal Was it at last the beginning of the end
Jimmie Dale as Larry the Bat unkempt disreputable in appearance
supposed dope fiend a figure familiar to every denizen below the dead
line skulked along the narrow illlighted street of the East Side
that on the corner ahead boasted the notorious resort to which Bristol
Bob had paid the doubtful if appropriate compliment of giving his
name From under the rim of his battered hat Jimmie Dales eyes veiled
by halfclosed wellsimulated drugladen lids missed no detail either
of his surroundings or pertaining to the passersby Though already late
in the evening halfnaked children played in the gutters hawkers of
multitudinous commodities cried their wares under gasoline banjo torches
affixed to their pushcarts shawled women of half a dozen races and men
equally cosmopolitan loitered at the curb or blocked the pavement
or brushed by him Now a man passed him flinging a greeting from
the corner of his mouth now another always without movement of the
lipsand Jimmie Dale answered themfrom the corner of his mouth

But while his eyes were alert his mind was only subconsciously attune
to his surroundings Was it indeed the beginning of the end Some day
he had told himself often enough the end must come Was it coming
now surely with a sort of grim implacabilitywhen it was too late to
escape Slowly but inexorably even his personal freedom of action
was narrowing being limited and ironically enough through the very
conditions he had himself created as an avenue of escape

It was not only the police now it was far more to be feared the
underworld as well In the old days the role of Larry the Bat had been
assumed at intervals at his own discretion when in a corner he had
no other way of escape now it was forced upon him almost daily The
character of Larry the Bat could no longer be discarded at will He had
flung down the gauntlet to the underworld when as the Gray Seal he had
closed the prison doors behind Stangeist The Mope Australian Ike and
Clarie Deane and the underworld had picked the gauntlet up Betrayed
as they believed by the one who though unknown to them they had
counted the greatest among themselves and each one fearful that his own
betrayal might come next every crook every thug in the Bad Lands
now eyed his oldest pal with suspicion and distrust and each was a
selfconstituted sleuth with the prod of selfpreservation behind him
sworn to the accomplishment of that unhallowed slogandeath to the Gray
Seal Almost daily now he must show himself as Larry the Bat in some
gathering of the underworlda prolonged absence from his haunts was not
merely to invite certain suspicion where all were suspicious of each
other it was to invite certain disaster He had now either to carry
the role like a little old man of the sea upon his back or renounce it
forever And the latter course he dared not even considerthe Sanctuary
was still the Sanctuary and the role of Larry the Bat was still a
refuge the trump card in the lone hand he played

He reached the corner pushed open the door of Bristol Bobs and
shuffled in The place was a glare of light a hideous riot of noise On
a polished section of the floor in the centre a turkey trot was in
full swing laughter and shouting vied raucously with an impossible
orchestra

Jimmie Dale slowly made the circuit of the room past the tables that
ranged around the sides were packed with occupants who thumped their
glasses in tempo with the music and clamoured at the rushing waiters
for replenishment A dozen two dozen men and women greeted him Jimmie
Dale indifferently returned their salutes What a galaxy of crooksthe
cream of the underworld His eyes under halfclosed lids swept the
faceslags dips gatmen yeggs mob stormers murderers petty sneak
thieves stalls hangersonthey were all there He knew them all he
was known to all

He shuffled on to the far end of the room his leer a little arrogant
a certain arrogance too in the tilt of his battered hat He also
was quite a celebrity in that gatheringLarry the Bat was of the
aristocracy and the elite of gangland Well the show was over he had
stalked across the stage performed for his audienceand in another
hour now free until he must repeat the same performance the next day in
some other equally notorious dive he would be sitting in for a rubber
of bridge at that most exclusive of all clubs the St James where none
might enter save only those whose names were vouched for in the highest
and most select circles and where for partners he would possibly have
a justice of the supreme court or mayhap an eminent divine He looked
suddenly around him as though startled It always startled him that
comparison There was something too stupendous to be simply ironical in
the incongruity of it Ifif he were ever run to earth

His eyes met those of a heavybuilt coarsefeatured man the chewed end
of a cigar in his mouth who stepped from behind the bar carrying a tin
tray with two full glasses upon it It was Bristol Bob expugilist the
proprietor

Howre you Larry grunted the man with what he meant to be a smile

Jimmie Dale was standing in the doorway of a passage that prefaced a
rear exit to the lane He moved aside to allow the other to pass

Ello Bristol he returned dispassionately

Bristol Bob went on along down the passage and Jimmie Dale shuffled
slowly after him He had intended to leave the place by the rear
doorit obviated the possibility of an undesirable acquaintance joining
company with him if he went out by the main entrance But now his
eyes were fixed on the proprietors back with a sort of speculative
curiosity There was a private room off the passage with a window on
the lane but they must be favoured customers indeed that Bristol Bob
would condescend to serve personallyany one who knew Bristol Bob knew
that

Jimmie Dale slowed his shuffling gait then quickened it again Bristol
Bob opened the door and passed into the private roomthe door was just
closing as Jimmie Dale shuffled by He had had only a glance insidebut
it was enough They were favoured customers indeed It was no wonder
that Bristol Bob himself was on the job Two men were in the room
Lannigan of headquarters rated the smartest plainclothes man in the
countryand across the table from Lannigan Whitey Mack as clever
finished and daring a crook as was to be found in the Bad Lands whose
particular line was diamonds or in the vernacular of his ilk white
stones that had earned him the sobriquet of Whitey Lannigan of
headquarters Whitey Mack of the underworld sworn enemies those twoin
secret session Bristol Bob might well play the part of outer guard If
a choice few of those outside in the dance hall could get a glimpse into
that private room it would be goodnight to Whitey Mack

Jimmie Dales eyes were narrowed a little as he shuffled on down the
passage Lannigan and Whitey Mack with their heads together What was
the game There was nothing in common between the two men Lannigan it
was well known could not be reached Whitey Mack with his ingenious
cleverness coupled with a coldblooded fearlessness that had made him
an object of unholy awe and respect in the eyes of the underworld was a
thorn that was sore beyond measure in the side of the police
Certainly it was no ordinary thing that had brought these two together
especially since with the unrest and suspicion that was bubbling
and seething below the dead line and with which there was none more
intimate than Whitey Mack Whitey Mack was inviting a risk in making
up with the police that could only be accounted for by some urgent and
vital incentive

Jimmie Dale pushed open the door that gave on the lane Behind him
Bristol Bob closed the door of the private room and retreated back along
the passage Jimmie Dale stepped out into the laneand instinctively
his eyes sought the window of the private room The shade was drawn
only a yellow murk filtered out into the black unlighted lane but
suddenly he started noiselessly toward it The window was open a bare
inch or so at the bottom

The sill was just shoulder high and placing his ear to the opening
he flattened himself against the wall He could not see inside for the
shade was drawn well to the bottom but he could hear as distinctly as
though he were at the table beside the two menand at the first words
the loose disjointed frame of Larry the Bat seemed to tauten curiously
and strain forward lithe and tense

This Gray Seal dope listens good Whitey but coming from you Im
leery Youve got to show me

Dont you want him There was a nasty laugh from Whitey Mack

You BET I want him returned the headquarters man with a suppressed
savagery that left no doubt as to his earnestness I want him fast
enough but

Then blast him so do I Whitey Mack rapped out with a vicious snarl
So does every guy in the fleet down here We got it in for him You
get that dont you Hes got Stangeist and his gang steered for the
electric chair now he put a crimp in the Weasel the other nightget
that Hes like a blasted wizard with what he knows And wholl he deal
the icy mitt to next Medamn himme for all I know

Thats all right observed Lannigan coolly Im not questioning your
sincerity for a minute I know all about that but that doesnt land the
Gray Seal Ill work with you if youve anything to offer but weve had
enough tips and information handed us at headquarters in the last
few years to make us a trifle skeptical Show me what youve got
Whitey

Show you echoed Whitey Mack passionately Sure Ill show you
Thats what Im going to doshow you Ill show you the Gray Seal I
aint handing you any tips IVE FOUND OUT WHO THE GRAY SEAL IS

There was a tense silence It seemed to Jimmie Dale as though cold
fingers were clutching at his heart stifling its beatthen the blood
came bursting to his forehead He could not see into the room but
that silence was eloquent It seemed as though he could picture the two
menLannigan leaning suddenly forwardLannigan and Whitey Mack staring
tensely into each others eyes

YouWHAT It came low and grim from Lannigan

Thats what asserted Whitey Mack bluntly You heard me Thats what
I said I know who the Gray Seal isand Im the only guy thats wise to
him Am I letting you in right

Youre sure demanded Lannigan hoarsely Youre sure Who is he
then

There was a half laugh half snarl from Whitey Mack

Oh no you dont he growled Nix on that What do you take me
fora fool You beat it out of here and round him upehwhile I suck
my thumbs Say forget it Do you think Im doing this because I love
you Why blame you youve been aching for a year to put the bracelets
on me yourself Say wake up Im in on this myself

Again that silence Then Lannigan spoke slowly in a puzzled way

I dont get you Whitey he said What do you mean Then a little
sharply Youre quite right youve got some reputation yourself and
youre badly wanted if we could get the goods on you If youre
trying to plant something look out for yourself or

Can that snapped Whitey Mack threateningly Can that sort of spiel
right nowor quit I aint telling you his nameyet BUT ILL TAKE
YOU TO HIM TONIGHTand you and me nabs him together Is that straight
enough goods for you

Dont get sore said Lannigan more pacifically Yes if youll do
that its good enough for any man But lay your cards on the table face
up WhiteyI want to see what you opened the pot on

Youve seen em Whitey Mack answered ungraciously Ive told you
already The Gray Seal goes out for keepscurse him for a snitch If
I bumped him off or wised up any of the guys to it and we was caught
wed get the juice for it even if it was the Gray Seal wouldnt we
Well whats the use If one of you dicks get him he gets bumped off
just the same only regular up in the wire parlour at Sing Sing I
aint looking for that kind of trouble when I can duck it See

Sure said Lannigan

Besides and moreover continued Whitey Mack theres SOME reward
hung out for him that Im figuring to born in on Id swipe it all
myself dont you make any mistake about that and youd never get a
lookin only sore as the mob is on the Gray Seal it aint healthy for
any guy around these parts to get the reputation of being a snitch no
matter who he snitches on Bump him offsure Snitchingwell you get
the idea eh Im ducking that too Get me

I get you said Lannigan with a short pleased laugh

Well then announced Whitey Mack heres my proposition and its my
turn to hand out the lookoutforyourself dope Im busting the game
wide open for you to play but you throw me down andhis voice sank
into a sullen snarl againyou can take it from me Ill get you for
it

All right responded Lannigan soberly Lets hear it If I agree to
it Ill stick to it

I believe you said Whitey Mack curtly Thats why I picked you out
for the medal theyll pin on you for this And heres getting down to
tacks Ill lead you to the Gray Seal tonight and help you nab him and
stay with you to the finish but theres to be nobody but you and me on
the job When its done I fade away and nobodys to know I snitched
and no questions asked as to how I found out about the Gray Seal
I aint looking for any of the gloryyou can fix that up to suit
yourself The cash is differentyou come across with half the reward
the day they pay it

Youll get it There was savage elation in Lannigans voice the
emphatic smash of a fist on the table Youre on Whitey And if we get
the Gray Seal tonight Ill do better by you than that

Well get him said Whitey Mack with a vicious oath And

Jimmie Dale crouched suddenly low down close against the wall The
crunch of a footstep sounded from the end of the lane Some one had
turned in from the cross street some fifty yards away and was heading
evidently for the back entrance to Bristol Bobs Jimmie Dale edged
noiselessly cautiously back past the doorway kept on pressed close
against the wall and finally paused He had not been seen The back
door of Bristol Bobs opened and closed The man had gone in

For a moment Jimmie Dale stood hesitant There was a wild surging in his
brain something like a myriad batteries of trip hammers seemed to be
pounding at his temples Then almost blindly he kept on down the lane
in the same direction in which he had started to retreatas well one
cross street as another

He turned into the cross street went along itand presently emerged
into the full tide of the Bowery It was garishly lighted people
swarmed about him Subconsciously there were crowded sidewalks
subconsciously he was on the Bowerythat was all

Ruin disaster peril faced himfaced him and staggered him with the
suddenness of the shock Was it true No it could not be true It was
a bluffWhitey Mack was bluffing Jimmie Dales lips grew thin in a
mirthless smile as he shook his head Neither Whitey Mack nor any other
man would dare to bluff like that It was too straight too openhanded
Whitey Mack had laid his cards too plainly on the table Whitey Macks
words rang in his ears Ill LEAD you to the Gray Seal tonight and
help you nab him and stay with you to the finish The man meant what he
said meant what he said too about the finish of the Gray Seal not
a man in the Bad Lands but meantdeath to the Gray Seal But how by
what means when where had Whitey Mack got his information Im the
only one thats wise Whitey Mack had said It seemed impossible It
WAS impossible Whitey Mack was sincere enough probably in what he had
said but the man simply could not know Whitey Mack could only have
spotted some one that for some reason or other he IMAGINED was the
Gray Seal That was itmust be it Whitey Mack had made a mistake What
clew could he have obtained to

Over the unwashed face of Larry the Bat a gray pallor spread slowly His
fingers were plucking at the frayed edge of his inside vest pocket
The dark eyes seemed to turn coalblack A laugh like the laugh of one
damned rose to his lips and was choked back It was gone GONE That
thin metal case like a cigarette case that between the little sheets
of oil paper held those diamondshaped graycoloured adhesive seals
the insignia of the Gray Sealwas gone Clew It seemed as though there
were an overpowering nausea upon him CLEW That little case was not a
clewit was a death warrant

His hands clenched fiercely If he could only think for a moment The
lining of his pocket had given away The case had dropped out But there
was nothing about the case to identify any one as the Gray Seal unless
it were found in ones actual possession Therefore Whitey Mack to have
solved his identity must have seen him drop the case There could be no
question about that It was equally obvious then that Whitey Mack would
know the Gray Seal as Larry the Bat Did he also know him as Jimmie
Dale Yes or no It was a vital question His life hung on it

That keen facile brain numbed for the moment was beginning to work
with lightning speed It was four oclock that afternoon when he had
assumed the character of Larry the Batsome time between four oclock
and the present it was now well after eleven the case had dropped from
his pocket There had been ample time then for Whitey Mack to have
made that appointment with Lanniganand ample time to have made a
surreptitious visit to the Sanctuary Had Whitey Mack gone there Had
Whitey Mack found that hiding place in the flooring under the oilcloth
Had Whitey Mack discovered that the Gray Seal was not only Larry the
Batbut Jimmie Dale

Jimmie Dale swept his hand across his forehead It was damp from
little clinging beads of moisture Should he go to the Sanctuary and
changebecome Jimmie Dale again Was it the safest thing to door the
most dangerous Even if Whitey Mack had been there and discovered the
dual personality of Larry the Bat how would he Jimmie Dale know it
The man would have been crafty enough to have left no sign behind him
Was it to the Sanctuary that Whitey Mack meant to lead Lannigan that
eveningor did Whitey Mack know him as Jimmie Dale and to make it
the more sensational plan to carry out the coup say at the St James
Club Whitey Mack and Lannigan were still at Bristol Bobs he had
probably time if he so elected to reach the Sanctuary change and get
away again But every minute was priceless now What should he do Run
from the city as he was for coveror take the gamblers chance Whitey
Mack knew him as Larry the Batit was not certain that Whitey Mack knew
him as Jimmie Dale

He had halted absorbed in front of a movingpicture theatre Great
placards at first but a blur of colour suddenly forced themselves in
concrete form upon his consciousness Letters a foot high leaped out at
him THE DOUBLE LIFE There was the picture of a banker in his private
office hastily secreting a forged paper as the hero in the guise of a
clerk entered the companion picture was the banker in convict stripes
staring out from behind the barred doors of a cell There seemed a
ghastly augury in the coincidence Why should a thing like that be
thrust upon him to shake his nerve when he needed nerve now more than he
had ever needed it in his life before

He raised his hand to jerk aimlessly at the brim of his hat dropped
his hand abruptly to his side again and started quickly hurriedly away
through the throng around him A sort of savagery had swept upon him
In a flash he had made his decision He would take the gamblers chance
And afterwardJimmie Dales lips were like a thin straight lineit
was Whitey Macks life or his own Whitey Mack had said he was the only
one that was wiseand Whitey Mack had not told Lannigan yet wouldnt
tell Lannigan until the showdown If he Jimmie Dale got to the
Sanctuary became Jimmie Dale and got away again even if Whitey Mack
knew him as Jimmie Dale there was still a chance It was his life or
Whitey MacksWhitey Mack with his leanjawed cleanshaven wolfs
face If he could get Whitey Mack before the other was ready to tell
Lannigan Surely he had the right of selfpreservation Surely his life
was as valuable as Whitey Macks as valuable as a mans who as those
in the secrets of the underworld knew well enough had blood upon his
hands who lived by crime who was a menace to the community Had he not
the right to preserve his own life at the expense of one such as that
He had never taken lifethe thought was abhorrent But was there any
other way in event of Whitey Mack knowing him as Jimmie Dale His
back was against the wall he was trapped certain death and worse
dishonour stared him in the face Lannigan and Whitey Mack would be
togetherthe odds would be two to one against himand he had no
quarrel with Lannigansomehow he must let Lannigan out of it

The other side of the street was less crowded He crossed over and
still with the shuffling tread that dozens around him knew as the
characteristic gait of Larry the Bat but covering the ground with
amazing celerity he hurried along It was only at the end of the block
that cross street from the Bowery that led to the Sanctuary How much
time had he He turned the corner into the darker cross street Whitey
Mack would have learned from Bristol Bob that Larry the Bat had just
been there that is that Larry the Bat was not at the Sanctuary Whitey
Mack would probably be in no hurryhe and Lannigan might wait until
later until Whitey Mack should be satisfied that Larry the Bat had gone
home It was the line of least resistance they would not attempt to
scour the city for him They might even wait in that private room at
Bristol Bobs until they decided that it was time to sally out He might
perhaps still find them there when he got back at any rate from there
he must pick up their trail again On the other handall this was but
suppositionthey might make at once for the Sanctuary to lie in wait
for him In any case there was need desperate need for haste

He glanced sharply around him and by the side of the tenement house
now that bordered on the alleyway with a curious swift gliding
motion he seemed to blend into the shadow and darkness It was the
Sanctuary that room on the first floor of the tenement the tenement
that had three entrances three exitsa passageway through to the
saloon on the next street that abutted on the rear the usual front
door and the side door in the alleyway Gone was the shuffling gait
Quick alert he ran crouching bent down along the alleyway reached
the side door opened it stealthily closed it behind him with equal
caution and in the dark entry stood motionless listening intently

There was no sound He began to mount the rickety dilapidated stairs
and where it seemed that the lightest tread must make them creak out in
blatant protest his trained muscles delicately compensating his body
weight carried him upward with a silence that was almost uncanny There
was need of silence as there was need of haste He was not so sure
now of the time at his disposalthat he had even reached the Sanctuary
FIRST How long had he loitered in that halfdazed way on the Bowery
He did not knowperhaps longer than he had imagined There was the
possibility that Whitey Mack and Lannigan were already above waiting
for him but even if they were not already there and he got away before
they came it was imperative that no one should know that Larry the Bat
had come and gone

He reached the landing and paused again his right hand with a vicious
muzzle of his automatic peeping now from between his fingers thrown
a little forward It was black utterly black around him Again that
stealthy catlike treadand his ear was at the keyhole of the Sanctuary
door A full minute priceless though it was passed then satisfied
that the room was empty he drew his head back from the keyhole and
those slim tapering fingers that in their tips seemed to embody
all the human senses felt over the lock Apparently it had been
undisturbed but that was no proof that Whitey Mack had not been there
after finding the metal case Whitey Mack was known to be clever with a
lockclever enough for that anyhow

He slipped in the key turned it and on hinges that were always oiled
silently pushed the door open and stepped across the threshold He
closed the door until it was just ajar that any sound might reach him
from withoutand whipping off his coat began to undress swiftly

There was no light He dared not use the gas it might be seen from the
alleyway He was moving now quickly surely silently here and there
It was like some weird spectre figure a little blacker than the
surrounding darkness flitting about the room The oilcloth in the
corner was turned back the loose flooring lifted the clothes of Jimmie
Dale taken out the rags of Larry the Bat put in The minutes flew by
It was not the change of clothing that took longit was the eradication
of Larry the Bats makeup from his face throat neck wrists and
hands Occasionally his head was turned in a tense listening attitude
but always the fingers were busy working with swift deftness

It was done at last Larry the Bat had vanished and in his place
stood Jimmie Dale the young millionaire the social lion of New York
immaculate in welltailored tweeds He stooped to the hole in the
flooring and his fingers going unerringly to their hiding place took
out a black silk mask and an electric flashlighthis automatic was
already in his possession His lips parted grimly Who knew what part
a flashlight might not playand he would need the mask for Lannigans
benefit even if it did not disguise him from Whitey Mack Had he left
any telltale evidence of his visit It was almost worth the risk of a
light to make sure He hesitated then shook his head and stooping
again carefully replaced the flooring and laid the oilcloth over ithe
dared not show a light at any cost

But now even more caution than before was necessary At times the
lodgers had naturally enough seen their fellow lodger Larry the Bat
enter and leave the tenementnone had ever seen Jimmie Dale either
leave or enter He stole across the room to the door halted to assure
himself that the hall was empty slipped out into the hall and locked
the door behind him Again that trained longpracticed silent tread
upon the stairs It seemed as though an hour passed before he reached
the bottom and his brain was shrieking at him to hurry hurry
HURRY The entryway at last the door the alleyway a long breath of
reliefand he was on the cross street

A step two he took in the direction of the Boweryand he was bending
down as though to tie his shoe his automatic from his side pocket
concealed in his hand WAS THAT SOME ONE THERE He could have sworn he
saw a shadowlike form start out from behind the steps of the house on
the opposite side of the street as he had emerged from the alleyway
In his bent posture without seemingly turning his head his eyes swept
sharply up and down the other side of the illlighted street Nothing
There was not even a pedestrian in sight on the block from there to the
Bowery

Jimmie Dale straightened up nonchalantly and stooped almost instantly
again as though the lace were still proving refractory Again that
sharp searching glance Againnothing He went forward now in apparent
unconcern but his right hand instead of being buried in his coat
pocket swung easily at his side

It was strange His ineffective ruse to the contrary he was certain
that he had not been mistaken Was it Whitey Mack Was the question
answered Was the Gray Seal known too as Jimmie Dale Were they
trailing him now with the climax to come at the club at his own
palatial home wherever the surroundings would best lend themselves
to assuaging that inordinate thirst for the sensational that was so
essentially a characteristic of the confirmed criminal What a headline
in the mornings papers it would make

At the corner he loitered by the curb to light a cigarettestill not a
soul in sight on either side of the street behind him except a couple
of Italians who had just passed by Strange again The intuition if it
were only intuition was still strong He swung abruptly on his heel
mingled with the passersby on the Bowery walked a rapid half dozen
steps until the building hid the cross street then ran across the road
to the opposite side of the Bowery and in a crowd now came back to
the corner He crossed from curb to curb slowly sheltered by a fringe
of people that however in no way obstructed his view down the side
street And then Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders He had evidently
been mistaken after all He was overexcited his nerves were rawthat
perhaps was the solution Meanwhile every minute was counting if
Whitey Mack and Lannigan should still be at Bristol Bobs

He kept on down the Bowery hurrying with growing impatience through the
crowds that massed in front of various places of amusement He had not
intended to come along the Bowery and except for what had occurred
would have taken a less frequented street He would turn off at the next
block

He was in front of that movingpicture theatre again THE DOUBLE
LIFEhis eyes were attracted involuntarily to the lurid overdone
display It seemed to threaten him it seemed to dangle before him a
premonition as it were of what the morning held in store but now too
it seemed to feed into flame that smouldering fury that possessed him
His lifeor Whitey Macks Men women and the children who turned
night into day in that quarter of the city were clustered thick around
the signs hiving like bees to the bald sensationalism Almost savagely
he began to force his way through the crowdand the next instant like
a man stunned had stopped in his tracks His fingers had closed in a
fierce spasmodic clutch over an envelope that had been thrust suddenly
into his hand

JIMMIE from somewhere came a low quick voice Jimmie it is
halfpast eleven nowHURRY

He whirled scanning wildly this face then that It was her voiceHER
voice The Tocsin The sensitive fingers were telegraphing to his brain
as they always did that the texture of the envelope too was hers
Her voice yes anywhere out of a thousand voices he would distinguish
hersbut her face he had never seen that Which out of all the crowd
around him was hers Surely he could tell her by her dress she would
be different her personality alone must single her out She

Say have youse got de pip or do youse tink youse owns de earth a
man flung at him heaving and pushing to get by

With a start though he scarcely heard the man Jimmie Dale moved on
His brain was afire All the irony of the world seemed massed in a
sudden overwhelming attack upon him It was uselessintuitively he
had known it was useless from the instant he had heard her voice It was
always the samealways For years she had eluded him like that come
upon him without warning and disappeared but leaving always that
tangible proof of her existencea letter the call of the Gray Seal to
arms But tonight it was as it had never been before It was not alone
baffled chagrin now not alone the longing the wild desire to see her
face to look into her eyesit was life and death She had come at the
very moment when she perhaps alone of all the world could have pointed
the way out when life liberty everything that was common to them both
was at stake in deadly periland she had gone ignorant of it all
leaving him staggered by the very possibility of the succour that was
held up before his eyes only to be snatched away without power of his to
grasp it His intuition had not been at faulthe had made no mistake
in that shadow across the street from the Sanctuary It had been the
Tocsin He had been followed and it was she who had followed him
until in a crowd she had seized the opportunity of a moment ago
Though ultimately perhaps it changed nothing it was a relief in a way
to know that it was she not Whitey Mack who had been lurking there
but her persistent incomprehensible determination to preserve the
mystery with which she surrounded herself was like now to cost them both
a ghastly price If he could only have had one word with herjust one
word

The letter in his hand crackled under his clenched fist He stared at
it in a halfblind halfbitter way The call of the Gray Seal to arms
Another coup with its incident danger and peril that she had planned
for him to execute He could have laughed aloud at the inhuman mockery
of it The call of the Gray Seal to armsNOW When with every faculty
drained to its last resource cornered trapped he was fighting for his
very existence

Jimmie it is halfpast eleven nowHURRY The words were jangling
discordantly in his brain

And now he laughed outright mirthlessly A young girl hanging on her
escorts arm passing glanced at him and giggled It was a different
Jimmie Dale for the moment For once his immobility had forsaken him He
laughed againa sort of unnatural desperate indifference to everything
falling upon him What did it matter the moment or two it would take to
read the letter He looked around him He was on the corner in front
of the Palace Saloon and turning abruptly he stepped in through the
swinging doors As Larry the Bat he knew the place well At the rear of
the barroom and along the side of the wall were some half dozen
little stalls partitioned off from each other Several of these were
unoccupied and he chose the one farthest from the entrance It was
private enough no one would disturb him

From the aproned individual who presented himself he ordered a drink
The man returned in a moment and Jimmie Dale tossed a coin on the
table bidding the other keep the change He wanted no drink the
transaction was wholly perfunctory The waiter was gone he pushed the
glass away from him and tore the envelope open

A single sheet closely written on both sides of the paper was in his
hand It was her writing there was no mistaking that but every word
every line bore evidence of frantic haste Even that customary formula
dear philanthropic crook that had prefaced every line she had ever
written him before had been omitted His eyes traversed the first few
lines with that strange indifference that had settled upon him What
after all did it matter what it was he could do nothingnot even save
himself probably And then with a little start he read the lines over
again muttering snatches from them

It brought a sudden thrill of excitement to Jimmie Dale that impossible
as he would have believed it an instant ago for the moment overshadowed
the realisation of his own peril A robbery such as that if it were
ever accomplished would stir the country from end to end it would set
New York by the ears it would loose the police in full cry like a pack
of bloodhounds with their leashes slipped The society columns of the
newspapers had been busy for months featuring the coming marriage of the
RossLogans daughter to one of the countrys young merchant princes
The combined fortunes of the two families would make the young couple
the richest in America The prospective grooms wedding gift was to be
a diamond necklace of perfectly matched large stones that would eclipse
anything of the kind in the country Europe the foreign markets had
been literally combed and ransacked to supply the gems The stones had
arrived in New York the day before the duty on them alone amounting to
over fifty thousand dollars All this had appeared in the papers

Jimmie Dales brows drew together in a frown On just exactly what
percentage the duty was figured he did not know but it was high
enough on the basis of fifty thousand dollars to assume safely that the
assessed value of the stones was not less than four times that amount
Two hundred thousand dollarslaid down a quarter of a million Well
why not In more than one quarter diamonds were ranked as the soundest
kind of an investment Furthermore through personal acquaintance with
the high contracting parties who were in his own set he knew it to
be true

He shrugged his shoulders The papers too had thrown the limelight on
Max Diestricht who though for quite a time the fashion in the social
world had up to the present been comparatively unknown to the average
New Yorker His own knowledge of Max Diestricht went deeper than the
superficial biography furnished by the newspapersthe old Hollander
had done more than one piece of exquisite jewelry work for him The old
fellow was a character that beggared description eccentric to the point
of extravagance and deaf as a post but in craftmanship a modern
Cellini He employed no workmen lived alone over his shop on one of
the lower streets between Fifth and Sixth Avenues near Washington
Squareand possessed a splendid contempt for such protective
contrivances as safes and vaults If his prospective patrons
expostulated on this score before intrusting him with their valuables
they were at liberty to take their work elsewhere It was Max Diestricht
who honoured you by accepting the commission not you who honoured Max
Diestricht by intrusting him with it Of what use is it to me a safe
he would exclaim It hides nothing it only says I am inside do
not look farther come and get me Yes It is to explode with the
nitroglycerinPOUFand I am deaf and I hear nothing It is a
foolishness thathe had a habit of prodding at one with a levelled
forefingerevery night somewhere they are robbed and have I been
robbed HEIN tell me that have I been robbed

It was true In ten years though at times having stones and precious
metal aggregating large amounts deposited with him by his customers Max
Diestricht had never lost so much as the gold filings There was a
queer smile on Jimmie Dales lips now The knot in the tenth board
was significant Max Diestricht was scrupulously honest a genius in
originality and conception of design a master in the perfection and
delicacy of his finished workhe had been commissioned to design and
set the RossLogan necklace

The brain works quickly All this and more had flashed almost
instantaneously through Jimmie Dales mind His eyes fell to the letter
again and he read on Halfway through a sudden whiteness blanched
his face and following it a surging tide of red that mounted to his
temples It dazed him it seemed to rob him for the moment of the
power of coherent thought He was wrong he had not read aright It was
incredible daredevil beyond beliefand yet in its very audacity lay
success He finished the letter read it once moreand his fingers
mechanically began to tear it into little shreds His brain was in a
whirl a vortex of conflicting emotions Had Whitey Mack and Lannigan
left Bristol Bobs yet Where were they now Was there time forthis
He was staring at the little torn scraps of paper in his hand He thrust
them suddenly into his pocket and jerked out his watch It was nearly
midnight The broad muscular shoulders seemed to square back curiously
the jaws to clamp a little the face to harden and grow cold until it
was like stone With a swift movement he emptied his glass into the
cuspidor set the glass back on the table and stepped out from the
stall His destination was Max Diestrichts

The Palace Saloon was near the upper end of the Bowery and failing a
taxicab of which none was in sight his quickest method was to walk
and he started briskly forward It was not far and it was barely
ten minutes from the time he had left the Palace Saloon when he swung
through Washington Square to Fifth Avenue and a moment later turned
from that thoroughfare heading west toward Sixth Avenue along one of
those streets which with the citys northward trend had quite lost
any distinctive identity and from being once a modestly fashionable
residential section had now become a conglomerate potpourri of small
tradesmens stores shops and apartments of the poorer class He knew
Max Diestrichtshe could well have done without the aid of the arc
lamp which even if dimly indicated that low almost tumbledown
twostory structure tucked away between the taller buildings on either
side that almost engulfed it It was late The street was quiet The
shops and stores had long since been closed Max Diestrichts among
themthe old Hollanders name in painted white letters stood out
against the background of a darkened workshop window In the story
above the lights too were out Max Diestricht was probably fast
asleepand he was stone deaf

A glance up and down the street and Jimmie Dale was standing or
rather leaning against Max Diestrichts door There was no one to see
and if there were what was there to attract attention to a man standing
nonchalantly for a moment in a doorway It was only for a moment Those
master fingers of Jimmie Dale were working surely swiftly silently A
little steel instrument that was never out of his possession was in the
lock and out again The door opened closed he drew the black silk mask
from his pocket and slipped it over his face Immediately in front of
him the stairs led upward immediately to his right was the door into
the shopthe modest street entrance was common to both

The door into the workshop was not locked He opened it stepped inside
and closed it quietly behind him The place was in blackness He stood
for a moment silent straining his ears to catch the slightest sound
reconstructing the plan of his surroundings in his mind as he remembered
it It was a narrow oblong room running the entire depth of the
building a very long room blank walls on either side a window in the
middle of the rear wall that gave on a back yard and from the back yard
there was access to the lane also as he remembered the place it was
a riot of disorder with workbenches and odds and ends strewn without
system or reason in every directionone had need of care to negotiate
it in the dark He took his flashlight from his pocket and preliminary
to a more intimate acquaintance with the interior glanced out through
the front window near which he stoodand with a suppressed cry shrank
back instinctively against the wall

Two men were crossing the street heading directly for the shop door
The arc lamp lighted up their faces IT WAS INSPECTOR LANNIGAN OF
HEADQUARTERS AND WHITEY MACK The quick intake of Jimmie Dale breath was
sucked through clenched teeth They were close on his heels thenfar
closer than he had imagined It would take Whitey Mack scarcely any
longer to open that front door than it had taken him Close on his
heels His face was rigid He could hear them now at the door The
flashlight in his hand winked down the length of the room If was a
dangerous thing to do but it was still more dangerous to stumble into
some object and make a noise He darted forward circuiting a workbench
a stool a small hand forge Again the flashlight gleamed Against the
side wall near the rear was another workbench with a sort of coarse
canvas curtain hanging part way down in front of it evidently to
protect such things as might be stored away beneath it from dust
and Jimmie Dale sprang for it whipped back the canvas and crawled
underneath He was not an instant too soon As the canvas fell back into
place the shop door opened closed and the two men had stepped inside

Whitey Macks voice in a low whisper though it was seemed to echo
raucously through the shop

Mabbe well have a sweet wait but I got the straight dope on this
Hes going to make a try for Dutchys sparklers tonight Well let him
go the limit and we dont either of us make a move till hes pinched
them and then we get him with the goods on him He cant get away
he hasnt a hope Theres only two ways of getting in here or getting
outthis door and window here and a window thats down there at the
back You guard this and Ill take care of the other end Savvy

Right Lannigan answered grimly Go ahead

There was the sound of footsteps moving forward then a vicious bump
the scraping of some object along the floor and a muffled curse from
Whitey Mack

Use your flashlight advised the inspector in a guarded voice

I havent got one damn it growled Whitey Mack Its all right
Ill get along

Again the steps but more warily now as though the man were cautiously
feeling ahead of him for possible obstacles Jimmie Dale for a moment
held his breath He could have reached out and touched the man as the
other passed Whitey Mack went on until he had taken up a position
against the rear wall Jimmie Dale heard him as he brushed against it

Then silence fell He was between them now Stretched full length on the
floor Jimmie Dale raised the lower portion of the canvas away from
in front of his face He could see nothing the place was in Stygian
blackness but it had been close and stifling and at least it gave
him more air

The minutes dragged byeach more interminable than the one that
had gone before Not a movement not a sound and then through the
stillness very faint at first came the regular repressed breathing
of Whitey Mack who was much the nearer of the two men And once
noticeable almost imperceptible as it was it seemed to pervade the room
and fill it with a strange ominous resonance that rose and fell until
the blackness palpitated with it

Slowly very slowly Jimmie Dales hand crept into his pocketand crept
out again with his automatic He lay motionless once more Time in any
concrete sense ceased to exist Fancied shapes began to assume form
in the darkness By the door Lannigan stirred uneasily shifting his
position slightly

Was it hourswas it only minutes It seemed to ring through the
nerveracking stillness like the shriek of a hurtling shelland it was
only a whisper

Watch yourself Lannigan whispered Whitey Mack Hes coming now
through the yard Dont move till I start something Let him get his
paws on the sparklers

Silence again And then a low rasping at the window like the gnawing of
a rat then inch by inch the sash was lifted There was the sound as
of a body forcing its way over the sill cautiously then a step upon the
floor inside another and still another The figure of a man loomed up
suddenly against the glow of a flashlight as he threw the round white
ray inquisitively here and there over the rear wall And now he appeared
to be counting the boards One two threeten His hand ran up and
down the tenth board Again and again he repeated the operation and
something like the snarl of a baited beast echoed through the room He
half turned to snatch at something in his pocket and the light for
a moment showed a blackbearded lowering face partially hidden by a
peaked cap that was pulled far down over his eyes

There was the rip and tear of rending wood as a steel jimmy in lieu of
the spring the man evidently could not find bit in between the boards
a muttered oath of satisfaction and a portion of the wall slid back
disclosing what looked like a metallined cupboard He reached in
seized one of a dozen little boxes and wrenched off the cover A blue
scintillating gleam seemed to leap out to meet the white ray of the
flashlight The man chuckled hoarsely and began to cram the rest of the
boxes into his pockets

Jimmie Dale stirred On hands and knees he was creeping now from beneath
the workbench Something caught and tore behind himthe canvas curtain
And at the sound with a sharp cry the man at the wall whirled the
light went out and he sprang toward the window Jimmie Dale gained his
feet and leaped forward A revolver shot cut a lane of fire through the
blackness and above the roar of the report Whitey Macks voice in a
fierce yell

Its all right Lannigan I got him NoHELL There was a terrific
crash of breaking glass Hes got away

Not yet he hasnt gritted Jimmie Dale between his teeth and his
clubbed revolver swung crashing to the head of a dark form in front of
him

There was a half sigh half moan The form slid limply to the floor
Lannigan was floundering down the shop leaping obstacles in a mad rush
his flashlight picking out the way

Jimmie Dale stepped swiftly backward and his hand groped out for the
droplight over the end of the bench that he had knocked against in
his own rush His fingers clutched itand the lower end of the shop was
flooded with light Except for his felt hat that lay a little distance
away there was no sign of Whitey Mack the huddled form of the man
who but a moment since had chuckled as he pocketed old Max Diestrichts
gems lay sprawled inert upon the floor and Lannigan was staring into
the muzzle of Jimmie Dales automatic

Drop that gun Lannigan said Jimmie Dale coolly And Ill trouble
you not to make a noise it might attract attention from the street
theres been too much already DROP THAT GUN

The revolver clattered from Lannigans hand to the floor A step
forward and Jimmie Dales toe sent it spinning under a bench Another
step and his revolver still covering the other he had whipped a pair
of handcuffs from the officers side pocket

Lannigan as though the thought had never occurred to him offered no
resistance He was staring in a dazed sort of way back and forth from
Jimmie Dale to the man on the floor

Whats this mean he burst out suddenly Wheres

Your wrist please requested Jimmie Dale pleasantly Nothe left
one Thank youas the handcuff snapped shut Now go over there and
sit down on the floor beside that fellow QUICK Jimmie Dales voice
rasped suddenly imperatively

Still bewildered but a little sullen now Lannigan obeyed Jimmie Dale
stooped quickly and snapped the other link of the handcuff over the
unconscious mans right wrist

Jimmie Dale smiled

Thats the approved way of taking your man isnt it Left wrist to the
prisoners right Hes only stunned hell be around in a moment Know
him

Lannigan shook his head

Take a good look at him invited Jimmie Dale You ought to know most
of them in the business

Lannigan bent over a little closer and then with an amazed cry his
free hand shot forward and tore away the others beard

IT WAS WHITEY MACK

My God gasped Lannigan

Quite so said Jimmie Dale evenly Youll find the diamonds in his
pockets and excuse mehis fingers were running through Whitey Macks
clothesah here it isthe thin metal case was in his handa
little article that belongs to me and whose loss I am free to admit
caused me considerable concern until I was informed that he had only
found it without having the slightest idea as to whom it belonged
It made quite a difference He had opened the case carelessly before
Lannigans eyes The Gray Seal Ill say it for you said Jimmie
Dale whimsically This is what probably put the idea into his head
after first in some way having discovered old Max Diestrichts hiding
place and if I had given him time enough he would probably have stuck
one of these seals in clumsy imitation of that little eccentricity of
mine on the wall over there to stamp the job as genuine You begin to
get it dont you Lannigan Pretty surefire as an alibi eh And hed
have got away with it too as far as you were concerned He had only
to fire that shot smash the window tuck his false beard mustache and
peaked cap into his pocket put on his own hat that you see there on the
floorand yell that the man had escaped Hed help you chase the thief
too Rather neat dont you think Lannigan And worth the risk too
considering the howl that would go up at the theft of those stones and
that known as the slickest diamond thief in the country he would be
the first to be suspectedexcept that the police themselves in the
person of Inspector Lannigan of headquarters would be prepared to prove
a perfectly good alibi for him

Lannigans head was thrust forward his eyes hard were riveted on
Whitey Mack

My God he said again under his breath Then fiercely Hell get his
for this

It was a moment before Jimmie Dale spoke he was musingly examining the
automatic in his hand

I am going now Lannigan he observed quietly I require say
fifteen minutes in which to effect my escape It is of course obvious
that an alarm raised by you might prove extremely awkward but a piece
of canvas from that bench there together with a bit of string would
make a most effective gag I prefer however not to submit you to that
indignity Instead I offer you the alternative of giving me your word
to remain quietly where you are forfifteen minutes

Lannigan hesitated

Jimmie Dale smiled

I agree said Lannigan shortly

Jimmie Dale stepped back The electriclight switch clicked The place
was in darkness There was a moment two of utter stillness then
softly from the front end of the shop a whisper

If I were you Lannigan Id take that gun from Whiteys pocket before
he comes round and beats you to it

And the door had closed silently behind Jimmie Dale



CHAPTER XI

THE STOOLPIGEON


In the subway ten minutes before a freckledfaced messenger boy had
squeezed himself into a seat beside Jimmie Dale yanked a dime novel
from a refractory pocket and blissfully lost to all the world had
buried his head in its pages Jimmie Dales glance at the youngster had
equally perforce embraced the lurid title of the thriller Dicing
with Death so imperturbably thrust under his nose At the time he had
smiled indulgently but now as he left the subway and headed for his
home on Riverside Drive the words not only refused to be ignored but
had resolved themselves into a curiously persistent refrain in his
mind They were exactly what they purported to be dimenovelish of
the deepest hue of yellow melodramatic in the extreme but also to him
now they were grimly apt and premonitorily appropriate Dicing with
Deaththere was not an hour not a moment in the day when he was not
literally dicing with death when with the underworld and the police
allied against him a single false move would lose him the throw that
left death the winner

The risk of the dual life enforced upon him grew daily greater and in
the end there must be the reckoning He would have been a madman to have
shut his eyes in the face of what was obviousbut it was worth it all
and in his soul he knew that he would not have had it otherwise even
now Tonight tomorrow the day after would come another letter
from the Tocsin and there would be another crime of the Gray Seals
blazoned in the presswould that be the last affair or would there
be anotheror tonight tomorrow the day after would he be trapped
before even one more letter came

He shrugged his shoulders as he ran up the steps of his house Those
were the stakes that he himself had laid on the table to wager upon the
game he had no quarrel there but if only before the end came or even
with the end itself he could findHER

With his latchkey he let himself into the spacious richly furnished
welllighted reception hall and crossing this went up the broad
staircase his steps noiseless on the heavy carpet Below faintly he
could hear some of the servantsthey evidently had not heard him close
the door behind him Discipline was relaxed somewhat it was quite
apparent with Jason that peer of butlers away Jason poor chap was
in the hospital Typhoid they had thought it at first though it had
turned out to be some milder form of infection He would be back in a
few days now but meanwhile he missed the old man sorely from the house

He reached the landing and turning went along the hall to the door of
his own particular den opened the door closed it behind himand in an
instant the keen agile brain trained to the little things that never
escaped it that daily held his life in the balance was alert The room
was unusually dark even for nighttime It was as though the window
shades had been closely drawna thing Jason never did But then Jason
wasnt there Jimmie Dale smiling then a little quizzically at himself
reached up for the electriclight switch beside the door pressed
itand his finger still on the button whipped his automatic from his
pocket with his other hand THE ROOM WAS STILL IN DARKNESS

The smile on Jimmie Dales lips was gone for his lips now had closed
together in a tight drawn line The lights in the rest of the house as
witness the reception hall were in order This was no ACCIDENT Silent
motionless he stood there listening Was he trapped at lastin his
own house By whom The police The thugs of the underworld It made
little differencethe end would differ only in the method by which it
was attained What was that Was there a slight stir a movement at the
lower end of the roomor was it his imagination His hand fell from the
electriclight switch to the doorknob behind his back Slowly without
a sound it began to turn under his slim tapering fingers whose deft
sensitive touch had made him known and feared as the master cracksman of
them all and as noiselessly the door began to open

It was like a duela duel of silence What was the intruder whoever he
might be waiting for The abortive click of the electriclight switch
to say nothing of the opening of the door when he had entered was
evidence enough that he was there Was the other trying to place him
exactly through the darkness to make sure of his attack The door was
open now And suddenly Jimmie Dale laughed easily aloudand on the
instant shifted his position

Well inquired Jimmie Dale coolly from the other side of the
threshold

It seemed like a longdrawn sigh fluttering through the room a gasp of
reliefand then the blood was pounding madly at his temples and he was
back in the room again the door closed once more behind him

Oh Jimmiewhy didnt you speak I had to be sure that it was you

It was her voice HERS The Tocsin HERE She was herehere in his
house

You he cried Youhere He was pressing the electriclight switch
frantically again and again

Her voice came out of the darkness from across the room

Why are you doing that Jimmie You know already that I have turned off
the lights

At the socketsof course He laughed out the words almost
hysterically Your faceI have never seen your face you know He was
moving quickly toward the reading lamp on his desk

There was a quick hurried swish of garments and she was blocking his
way

No she said in a low voice you must not light that lamp

He laughed again shortly fiercely now She was close to him his hands
reached out for her touched her and thrilling at the touch swept her
toward him

JimmieJimmieare you mad she breathed

Mad Yeshe was mad with the wildest most passionate exhilaration he
had ever known He found his voice with an effort

These months and years that I have tried until my soul was sick to find
you he cried out And you are here now Your faceI must see your
face

She had wrenched herself away from him He could hear her breath coming
sharply in little gasps He groped his way onward toward the desk

WAITher tones seemed to ring suddenly vibrant through the room
Wait before you touch that lamp II put you on your honour not to
light it

He stopped abruptly

Myhonour he repeated mechanically

Yes I came here tonight because there was no other way No other
waydo you understand I came trusting to your honour not to take
advantage of the conditions that forced me to do this I had no fear
that I was wrongI have no fear now You will not light that lamp
and you will not make any attempt to prevent my going away as I
cameunknown Is there any question about it Jimmie I am in YOUR
house

You dont know what you are saying he burst out wildly Ive risked
my life for a chance like this again and again Ive gone through hell
living in squalour for a month on end as Larry the Bat in the hope that
I might discover who you areand do you think Ill let anything stop me
now I tell you noa thousand times no

She made no answer There was only her low quick breathing coming from
somewhere near him He made another step toward the lampand stopped

I tell you no he said again and took another step forwardand
stopped once more

Still she made no answer A minute passedanother His hand lifted and
swept across his forehead in an agitated way Still silence She neither
moved nor spoke His hand dropped slowly to his side There was a queer
twisted smile upon his lips

You win he said hoarsely

Thank you Jimmie she said simply

And your name who you arehe was speaking but he did not seem to
recognise his own voicethe hundred other things Ive sworn Id make
you explain when I found you are all taboo as well I suppose

Yes she said

He laughed bitterly

Dont you know he cried out that between the police and the
underworld our house of cards is likely to collapse at any minutethat
they are hunting the Gray Seal day and night Is it to be always like
thisthat I am never to knowuntil it is too late

She came toward him out of the darkness impulsively

They will never get you Jimmie she said in a suppressed voice And
some day I promise you now you shall have your reward for tonight
You shall knoweverything

When The word came from him with fierce eagerness

I do not know she answered gently Soon perhapsperhaps sooner
than either of us imagine

And by that you meanwhat he asked and his hand reached out for her
again through the blackness

This time she did not draw away There was an instants hesitation then
she spoke again hurriedly a note of anxiety in her voice

You are beginning all over again arent you Jimmie And I have told
you that tonight I can explain nothing And besides it is what has
brought me here that counts now and every moment is of

Yes I know he interposed but then at least you will tell me one
thing Why did you come tonight instead of sending me a letter as you
always have before

Because it is different tonight than it ever was before she replied
earnestly Because there is something in what has happened that I
cannot explain myself because there is danger and where I could not
see clearly I feared a trap and so I dared not send what in a letter
could at best be only vague and incomplete details Do you see

Yes said Jimmie Dalebut he was only listening in an abstracted way
If he could only see that face so close to his He had yearned for that
with all his soul for years now And she was here standing beside him
and his hand was upon her arm and here in his own den in his own
house he was listening to another call to arms for the Gray Seal from
her own lips Honour Was he but a poor quixotic fool He had only
to step to the desk and switch on the light Why shouldhe steadied
himself with a jerk and drew away his hand She was in HIS house Go
on he said tersely

Do you know or did you ever hear of old Luther Doyle she asked

No said Jimmie Dale

Do you know a man then named Connie Myers

Connie Myers Who in the Bad Lands did not know Connie Myers who
boasted of the half dozen prison sentences already to his credit Yes
he knew Connie Myers But strangely enough it was not in the Bad Lands
or as Larry the Bat that he knew the man or that the other knew himit
was as Jimmie Dale Connie Myers had introduced himself one night
several years ago with a blackjack that had just missed its mark as the
man had jumped out from a dark alleyway on the East Side and he Jimmie
Dale had thrashed the other to within an inch of his life He had
reason to know Connie Myersand Connie Myers had reason to remember
him

Yes he said with a grim smile I know Connie Myers

And the tenement across the street from where you live as Larry the
Batthat of course you know He leaned toward her wonderingly now

Of course he ejaculated Naturally

Listen then Jimmie She was speaking quickly now It is a strange
story This Luther Doyle was already over fifty when some eight or
nine years ago his parents died within a few months of each other
and he inherited somewhere in the neighbourhood of a hundred thousand
dollars but the man though harmless enough was mildly insane
halfwitted queer and the old couple on account of their sons mental
defects took care to leave the money securely invested and so that he
could only touch the interest During these eight or nine years he has
lived by himself in the same old family house where he had lived with
his parents in a lonely spot near Pelham And he has lived in a most
frugal even miserly manner His income could not have been less than
six thousand dollars a year and his expenditures could not have been
more than six hundred His dementia ironically enough from the day that
he came into his fortune took the form of a most pitiable and abject
fear that he would die in poverty misery and want and so year after
year cashing his checks as fast as he got them never trusting the bank
with a penny he kept hiding away somewhere in his house every cent he
could scrape and save from his incomewhich today must amount at a
minimum calculation to fifty thousand dollars

And observed Jimmie Dale quietly Connie Myers robbed him of it
and

No Her voice was quivering with passion as she caught up his words
Twice in the last month Connie Myers TRIED to rob him but the money
was too securely hidden Twice he broke into Doyles house when the old
man was out but on both occasions was unsuccessful in his search and
was interrupted and forced to make his escape on account of Doyles
return Tonight an hour ago in an empty room on the second floor
of that tenement in the room facing the landing old Luther Doyle was
MURDERED

There was silence for an instant Her hand had closed in a tight
pressure on his arm The darkness seemed to add a sort of ghastly
significance to her words

In Gods name how do you know all this he demanded wildly How do
you know all these things

Does that matter now she answered tensely You will know that when
you know the rest Oh dont you understand Jimmie there is not a
moment to lose now It was easy to lure a halfwitted creature like that
anywhere it was Connie Myers who lured him to the tenement and murdered
him therebut from that point Jimmie I am not sure of our ground I
do not know whether Connie Myers is alone in this or not but I do know
that he is going to Doyles house again tonight to make another search
for the money There is no question but that old Doyle was murdered to
give Connie Myers and his accomplices if there are any a chance to
tear the house inside out to find the money to give them the whole
night to work in without interruption if necessarybut Doyle dead in
his own house could have interfered no more with them than Doyle dead in
that tenement Why was he lured to the tenement by Connie Myers when he
could much more easily have been put out of the way in his own house
Jimmie there is something behind this something more that you must
find out There may be others in this besides Connie Myers I do not
know but there is something here that I am afraid of Jimmie you must
get that man you must get the others if there are others and you
must stop them from getting the money in that house tonight Do you
understand now why I have come here I could not explain in a letter
I do not quite seem to be explaining now It would seem as though
there were no need for the Gray Sealthat simply the police should be
notified But I KNOW Jimmie call it intuition what you will I know
that there is need for us for you tonightthat behind all this is a
tragedy deeper blacker than even the brutal coldblooded murder that
is already done

Her voice in its passionate earnestness died away and an anger
cold grim remorseless settled upon Jimmie Dalesettled as it always
settled upon him at her call to arms His brain was already at work in
its quick instant way probing sifting planning She was right It
was strange it was more than strange that with the added risk the
danger the difficulty the man should have been brought miles to be
done away with in that tenement Why Connie Myers took form before
himthe coarse features the tawny hair that straggled across the low
forehead the shifty eyes that were an indeterminate colour between
brown and gray the thin lips that seemed to draw in and give the jaw
a protruding belligerent effect And Connie Myers knew him as Jimmie
Daleit would have to be then as Larry the Bat that the Gray Seal must
work That meant timeto go to the Sanctuary and change

The police he asked suddenly aloud they have not yet discovered
the body

Not yet she replied hurriedly And that is still another reason
for hastethere is no telling when they will Seehere She thrust
a paper into his hand Here is a plan of old Doyles house and
directions for finding it You must get Connie Myers redhanded you
must make him convict himself for the evidence through which I know him
to be guilty can never be used against him And Jimmie be carefulI
know I am not wrong that there is still something more behind all this
And now go Jimmie go There is no time to lose She was pushing him
across the room toward the door

Go The word seemed suddenly to bring dismay It was she again who was
dominant now in his mind Who knew if tonight when he was taking his
life in his hands again would not be the last And she was here now
here beside himwhere she might never be again

She seemed to divine his thoughts for she spoke again a strange new
note of tenderness in her voice that thrilled him

You must never let them get you Jimmiefor my sake It will not last
much longerit is near the endand I shall keep my promise But go
now Jimmiego

Go he repeated numbly Go Butbut you

I She slipped suddenly away from him retreating back down the room
I will goas I came

Wait Listen he pleaded

There was no answer

She was theresomewhere back there in the darkness still He stood
hesitant at the door It seemed that every faculty he possessed urged
him back there againto her Could he let her escape him now when she
was so utterly in his power she who meant everything in his life And
then like a cold shock came that other thoughtshe who had trusted to
his honour With a jerk his hand swept out felt for the doorknob and
closed upon it

Goodnight he said heavily and stepped out into the hall

It seemed for a while even after he had gained the street and made his
way again to the subway that nothing was concrete around him that
he was living through some fantastical dream His head whirled and he
could not think rationallyand then slowly little by little his grip
upon himself came back She had comeand gone With the roar of the
subway in his ears its raucous note seeming to strike so perfectly in
consonance with the turmoil within him he smiled mirthlessly After
all it was as it always was She was goneand ahead of him lay the
chances of the night

Dicing with death The words unbidden came back once more If they
were true before they were doubly applicable now It was different
tonight from what it had ever been before as she had said Usually to
the smallest detail everything was laid open clear before him in
those astounding letters Tonight it was vague at best A man had been
murdered Connie Myers had committed the murder under circumstances that
pointed strongly to some hidden motive behind and beyond the mere chance
it afforded him to search his victims house for the hidden cash What
was it

Jimmie Dale stared out at the black subway walls The answer would not
come Station after station passed At Fourteenth Street he changed from
the express to a local got out at Astor Place and a few minutes later
was walking rapidly down the upper end of the Bowery

The answer would not comeonly the fact itself grew more and more
deeply significant The ghastly callous fiendishness that lured an
old halfwitted man to his death had Jimmie Dale in that grip of cold
merciless anger again and there was a dull flush now upon his cheeks
Whatever it meant whatever was behind it one thing at least was
certainHE WOULD GET CONNIE MYERS

He was close to the Sanctuary nowit was down the next cross street He
reached the corner and turned it heading east but his brisk walk had
changed to a nonchalant saunterthere were some people coming toward
him It was the Gray Seal now alert and cautious The little group
passed by Ahead the tenement bordering on the black alleyway loomed
upthe Sanctuary with its three entrances and exits the home of Larry
the Bat And across from it was that other tenement that held a new
interest for him now where in an empty room on the second floor
she had said old Doyle still lay Should he go there He was thinking
quickly now and shook his head It would take what he did not have to
sparetime It was already ten oclock and granted that Connie Myers
had committed the crime only a little over an hour ago the man by this
time would certainly be on his way to Doyles house near Pelham if
indeed he were not already there No there was no time to sparethe
question resolved itself simply into how long since he had already
searched twice and failed on both occasions it would take Connie Myers
to unearth old Doyles hiding place for the money

Jimmie Dale glanced sharply around him slipped into the alleyway and
crouching against the tenement wall moved noiselessly along to the side
entrance A moment more and he had negotiated the rickety stairs with
practiced soundless tread was inside the squalid quarters of Larry the
Bat and the door of the Sanctuary was locked and bolted behind him

Perhaps five minutes passedand then where Jimmie Dale the
millionaire had entered there emerged Larry the Bat of the
aristocracy and the elite of the Bad Lands But instead of leaving by
the side door and the alleyway as he had entered he went along the
lower hallway to the front entrance And here instinctively he paused
a moment at the top of the steps as his eyes rested upon the tenement
on the opposite side of the street

It was strange that the crime should have been committed there
Something again seemed to draw him toward that empty room on the second
story He had decided once that he would not go that there was not
time but after all it would not take long and there was at least the
possibility of gaining something more valuable even than time from the
scene of the crime itselfthere might even be the evidence he wanted
there that would disclose the whole of Connie Myers game

He went down the steps and started across the street but halfway over
he hesitated uncertainly as a childs cry came petulantly from the
doorway It was dark in the street and likewise it was one of those
hot suffocating evenings when in the crowded tenements of the poorer
class miserable enough in any case misery was added to a hundredfold
for lack of a single Godgiven breath of air These two facts
apparently irrelevant caused Jimmie Dale to change his mind again
He had not noticed the woman with the baby in her arms sitting on
the doorstep but now as he reached the curb he not only saw but
recognised herand he swung on down the street toward the Bowery He
could not very well go in without passing her without being recognised
himselfand that was a needless risk

He smiled a little wanly Once the crime was discovered she would not
have hesitated long before informing the police that she had seen him
enter there Mrs Hagan was no friend of his One could not live as he
had lived as Larry the Bat and not see something in an intimate way
of the pitiful little tragedies of the poor around him for bad tough
and dissolute as the quarter was all were not degraded there some were
simplypoor Mrs Hagan was poor Her husband was a day labourer often
out of a joband sometimes he drank That was how he Jimmie Dale
or rather Larry the Bat had come to earn Mrs Hagans enmity He had
found Mike Hagan drunk one night and in the act of being arrested and
had wheedled the man away from the officer on the promise that he would
take Hagan home And he was Larry the Bat a dope fiend a character
known to all the neighbourhood and Mrs Hagan had laid her husbands
condition to HIS influence and companionship He had taken Mike Hagan
homeand Mrs Hagan had driven Larry the Bat from the door of her
miserable oneroom lodging in that tenement with the bitter words on
her tongue that only a woman can use when shame and grief and anger are
breaking her heart

He shrugged his shoulders as back along the Bowery he retraced his
steps but now with the hurried shuffle of Larry the Bat where before
had been the brisk athletic stride of Jimmie Dale

At Astor Place again he took the subway this time to the Grand
Central Stationand well within an hour from the time he had left the
Sanctuary including the train journey to Pelham he was standing in a
clump of trees that fringed a deserted roadway He had passed but few
houses once he was away from Pelham and as well as he could judge
there was none now within a quarter of a mile of himexcept this one
of old Luther Doyles that showed up black and shadowy just beyond the
trees

Jimmie Dales eyes narrowed as he surveyed the place It was little
wonder that known to have money an attempt to rob old Doyle should
have been made in a place like this It was even more grimly significant
than ever of some deeper meaning that in its loneliness an ideal place
for a murder the man should have been lured from there for that purpose
to a crowded tenement in the city instead What did it mean Why had
it been done He shook his head The answer would not come now any more
than it had come before in the subway or in the train on the way out
when he had set his brain so futilely to solve the problem

From a survey of the house Jimmie Dale gave attention to the details of
his surroundings the trees on either side the open space in front a
distance of fifty yards to the road the absence of any fence And then
abruptly he stole forward There was no light to be seen anywhere about
the house Was it possible that Connie Myers was not yet there He
shook his head again impatiently Connie Myers would not have wasted any
timeas the Tocsin had said there was always present the possibility
that the crime in that tenement might be discovered at ANY moment
Connie Myers would have lost no time for let the discovery be made
let the police identify the body as they most certainly would and they
would be out here hotfoot Jimmie Dale stood suddenly still What did it
mean He had not thought of that before If old Doyle had been murdered
HERE there would not have been even the possibility of discovery until
the morning at the earliest and Connie Myers would have had all the
time he wanted

WHAT WAS THAT SOUND A low muffled tapping like a succession of hammer
blows came from within the house Jimmie Dale darted forward reached
the side of the house and dropped on hands and knees One question at
least was answeredConnie Myers was inside

The plan that she had given him showed an oldfashioned cellarway
closed by folding trapdoors that was located a little toward the rear
and in a moment creeping along he came upon it His hands felt over
it It was shut fastened by a padlock on the outside Jimmie Dales
lips thinned a little as he took a small steel instrument from his
pocket Either through inadvertence or by intention Connie Myers had
passed up an almost childishly simple means of entrance into the house
One side of the trapdoor was lifted up silentlyand silently closed
Jimmie Dale was in the cellar The hammering much more distinct now
heavy thudding blows came from a room in the frontthe connection
between the cellar and the house as shown on the Tocsins plan was
through another trapdoor in the floor of the kitchen

Jimmie Dales flashlight played on a short ladderlike stairway and
in an instant he was climbing upward The sounds from the front of the
house continued now without interruption there was little fear that
Connie Myers would hear anything elseeven the protesting squeak of
the hinges as Jimmie Dale cautiously pushed back the trapdoor in the
flooring above his head An inch two inches he lifted it and his eyes
on a level with the opening now he peered into the room The kitchen
itself was intensely dark but through an open doorway well to one
side so that he could not see into the room beyond there struggled
a curiously faint dim glimmer of light And then Jimmie Dales form
straightened rigidly on the stairs The blows stopped and a voice in a
low growl presumably Connie Myers reached him

Here take a drive at it from the lower edge

There was no answersave that the blows were resumed again Jimmie
Dales face had set hard Connie Myers was not alone in this then
Well the odds were a little heavier DOUBLEDthat was all He pushed
the trapdoor wide open swung himself up through the opening to the
floor and the next instant back a little from the connecting doorway
his body pressed closely against the kitchen wall he was staring
bewildered and amazed into the next room

On the floor presumably to lessen the chance of any light rays stealing
through the tightly drawn window shades burned a small oil lamp The
place was in utter confusion The righthand side of a large fireplace
made of rough untrimmed stone and cement and which occupied almost
the entire end of the room was already practically demolished and
the wreckage was littered everywhere part of the furniture was piled
unceremoniously into one corner out of the way and at the fireplace
itself working with sledge and bar were two men One was Connie Myers
An ironical glint crept into Jimmie Dales eyes The false beard and
mustache the man wore would deceive no one who knew Connie Myers And
that he should be wearing them now as he knelt holding the bar while
the other struck at it seemed both uncalled for and absurd The other
man heavily built roughly dressed had his back turned and Jimmie
Dale could not see his face

The puzzled frown on Jimmie Dales forehead deepened Somewhere in the
masonry of the fireplace of course was where old Luther Doyle had
hidden his money That was quite plain enough and that Connie Myers in
some way or other had made sure of that fact was equally obvious But
how did old Luther Doyle get his money IN there from time to time as he
received the interest and dividends whose accumulation according to the
Tocsin comprised his hoard And how did he get it OUT again

All right thatll do grunted Connie Myers suddenly We can pry this
one out now Lend a hand on the bar

The other dropped his sledge turned sideways as he stooped to help
Connie Myers his face came into viewand with an involuntary start
Jimmie Dale crouched farther back against the wall as he stared at the
other It was Hagan Mrs Hagans husband Mike Hagan

My God whispered Jimmie Dale under his breath

So that was it That the murder had been committed in the tenement was
not so strange now A surge of anger swept Jimmie Daleand was engulfed
in a wave of pity Somehow the thin tired face of Mrs Hagan had risen
before him and she seemed to be pleading with him to go away to leave
the house to forget that he had ever been there to forget what he
had seen what he was seeing now His hands clenched fiercely How
realistically how importunately how pitifully she took form before
him She was on her knees clasping his knees imploring him terrified

From Jimmie Dales pocket came the black silk mask Slowly almost
hesitantly he fitted it over his faceMike Hagan knew Larry the Bat
Why should he have pity for Mike Hagan Had he any for Connie Myers
What right had he to let pity sway him The man had gone the limit
he was Connie Myers accomplicea murderer But the man was not a
hardened confirmed criminal like Connie Myers Mike Hagana murderer
It would have been unbelievable but for the evidence before his own
eyes now The man had faults brawled enough and drank enough to have
brought him several times to the notice of the policebut this

Jimmie Dales eyes had never left the scene before him Both men were
throwing their weight upon the bar and the stone that they were trying
to dislodgethey were into the heart of the masonry nowseemed to
move a little Connie Myers stood up and leaning forward examined the
stone critically at top and bottom prodding it with the bar He turned
from his examination abruptly and thrust the bar into Hagans hands

Hold it he said tersely Ill strike for a turn

Crouched on his hands and knees Hagan inserted the point of the bar
into the crevice Connie Myers picked up the sledge

Lower Bend lower he snappedand swung the sledge

It seemed to go black for a moment before Jimmie Dales eyes seemed to
paralyse all action of mind and body There was a low cry that was more
a moan the clang of the iron bar clattering on the floor and Mike
Hagan had pitched forward on his face an inert and huddled heap A half
laugh half snarl purled from Connie Myers lips as he snatched a stout
piece of cord from his pocket and swiftly knotted the unconscious mans
wrists together Another instant and picking up the bar prying with
it again the loosened stone toppled with a crash into the grate

It had come sudden as the crack of doom that blowtoo quick too
unexpected for Jimmie Dale to have lifted a finger to prevent it And
now that the first numbed shock of mingled horror and amazement was
past he fought back the quick fierce impulse to spring out on Connie
Myers Whether the man was killed or only stunned he could do no good
to Mike Hagan now and there was Connie Myershe was staring in a
fascinated way at Connie Myers Behind the stone that the other had just
dislodged was a large hollow space that had been left in the masonry
and from this now Connie Myers was eagerly collecting handfuls of
banknotes that were rolled up into the shape of little cylinders each
one grotesquely tied with a string The man was feverishly excited
muttering to himself running from the fireplace to where the table had
been pushed aside with the rest of the furniture dropping the curious
little rolls of money on the table and running back for more And then
having apparently emptied the receptacle he wriggled his body over
the dismantled fireplace stuck his head into the opening and peered
upward

Kinks in his nut kinks in his nut Connie Myers was muttering Ill
drop the bar through from the top mabbe theres some got stuck in the
pipe

He regained his feet picked up the bar and ran with it into what was
evidently the front hallthen his steps sounded running upstairs

Like a flash Jimmie Dale was across the room and at the fireplace Like
Connie Myers he too put his head into the opening and then a queer
unpleasant smile on his lips he bent quickly over the man on the floor
Hagan was no more than stunned and was even then beginning to show
signs of returning consciousness There was a rattle a clang a
thudand the bar too long to come all the way through dropped into
the opening and stood upright Connie Myers footsteps sounded again
returning on the runand Jimmie Dale was back once more on the other
side of the kitchen doorway

It was all simple enoughonce one understood The same queer smile
was still flickering on Jimmie Dales lips There was no way to get the
money out except the way Connie Myers had got it outby digging it
out With the irrational cunning of his mad brain that had put the
money even beyond his own reach old Doyle had built his fireplace with
a hollow some eighteen inches square in a great wall of solid stonework
and from it had run a twoinch pipe up somewhere to the story above
and down this pipe he had dropped his little stringtied cylinders of
banknotes satisfied that his hoard was safe There seemed something
pitifully ironic in the elaborate insane craftiness of the old mans
feartwisted demented mind

And now Connie Myers was back in the room againand again a puzzled
expression settled upon Jimmie Dales face as he watched the other For
perhaps a minute the man stood by the table sifting the little rolls of
money through his fingers gloatinglythen impulsively he pushed these
to one side produced a revolver laid it on the table and from another
pocket took out a little case which as he opened it Jimmie Dale could
see contained a hypodermic syringe One more article followed the other
twoa letter which Connie Myers took out of an unsealed envelope He
dropped this suddenly on the table as Mike Hagan three feet away on
the floor groaned and sat up

Hagans eyes swept bewildered confused around him questioningly
at Connie Myersand then resting suddenly on his bound wrists they
narrowed menacingly

Damn you you smashed me with that sledge on PURPOSE he burst
outand began to struggle to his feet

With a brutal chuckle Connie Myers pushed Hagan back and shoved his
revolver under the others nose

Sure he admitted evenly And you keep quiet or Ill finish you
nowinstead of letting the police do it He laughed out jarringly
Youre under arrest you know for the murder of Luther Doyle and for
robbing the poor old nut of his savings in his house here

Hagan wrenched himself up on his elbow

Whatwhat do you mean he stammered

Oh dont worry said Connie Myers maliciously IM not making the
arrest Id rather the police did that Im not mixing up in it and
by and byhe lifted up the hypodermic for Hagan to seeIm going
to shoot a little dope into you thatll keep you quiet while I get away
myself

Hagans face had gone a grayish whitehe had caught sight of the money
on the table and his eyes kept shifting back and forth from it to
Myers face

Murder he said huskily There is no murder I dont know who Doyle
is You said this house was yoursyou hired me to come here You said
you were going to tear down the fireplace and build another You said I
could work evenings and earn some extra money

Sure I did There was a vicious leer now on Connie Myers lips But
you dont think I picked you out by ACCIDENT do you Your reputation
my bucko was just shady enough to satisfy anybody that it wouldnt be
beyond you to go the limit Sure you murdered Doyle Listen to this
He took up the letter


TO THE POLICE Luther Doyle was murdered this evening in the tenement
at 67  Street Youll find his body in a room on the second floor
If you want to know who did it look in Mike Hagans room on the floor
above Theres a paper stuck under the edge of Hagans table with a
piece of chewing gum where he hid it Youll know what it is when
you go out and take a look at Doyles house in Pelham Yours truly A
FRIEND


Mike Hagan did not speakhis lips were twitching and there was horror
creeping into his eyes

Dye get me sneered Connie Myers Tell your storywhod believe it
I got you cinched Twice I tried to get this old dubs coin out here
and couldnt find it But the second time I found something elsea
piece of paper with a drawing of the fireplace on it and a place in the
drawing marked with an X That was good enough wasnt it Thats
the paper I stuck under your table this afternoon when your wife was
outsee Somebodys got to stand for the job and if its somebody else
it wont be meget me When I had a look at that fireplace I knew I
couldnt do the job alone in a week and I didnt dare blast it with
soup for fear of spoiling what was inside And since I had to have
somebody to help me I thought I might as well let him help me all the
way throughand stand for it I picked you Mikethats why I croaked
old Doyle in your tenement tonight I wrote this letter while I was
waiting for you to show up at the station to come out here with me and
Im going to see that the police get it in the next hour When they
find Doyle in the room below yours and that paper in your room and the
busted fireplace hereI guess they wont look any farther for who did
it And sayhe leaned forward with an ugly grinmabbe you think Im
soft to be telling you all this But dont you fool yourself You dont
know meyou dont know who I am So tell em the TRUTH They wont
believe you anyway with evidence like that against youand the neater
the story the more theyll think it shows brains enough on your part to
have pulled a job like this

My God Hagan was rocking on his knees beads of sweat were starting
out on his forehead You wouldnt plant a man like that he cried
brokenly You wouldnt do it would you My Godyou wouldnt do that

Jimmie Dales face under his mask was white and rigid There was
something primal elemental in the savagery that was sweeping upon him
He had it all nowALL She had been rightthere was need tonight for
the Gray Seal So that was the game inhuman hellish the whole of
it to the last filthy dregsConnie Myers to protect himself was
railroading an innocent man to death for the crime that he himself had
committed There was a cold smile on Jimmie Dales lips now as he took
his automatic from his pocket No it wasnt quite all the gamethere
was still HIS hand to play He edged forward a little nearer to the
doorand halted abruptly listening An automobile had stopped outside
on the road Hagan was still pleading in a frenzied way Connie
Myers was callously folding his letter while he watched the other
warilyneither of the men had heard the sound

And then quick almost on the instant came a rush of feet a crash
upon the front dooran imperative command to open in the name of the
law THE POLICE Jimmie Dales brain was working now with lightning
speed Somehow the police had stumbled upon the crime in that tenement
and as he had foreseen in such an event had identified Doyle But they
could not be sure that any one was present here in the house nowthey
could not see a light any more than he had He must get Mike Hagan
awaymust see that Connie Myers did NOT get away Myers was on his
feet now fear struck in his turn the letter clutched in a tightclosed
fist his revolver swung out poised in the other hand Hagan too was
on his feet and unheeded now by Connie Myers was wrenching his wrists
apart

Another crash upon the dooranother Another demand in a harsh voice to
open it Then some one running around to the window at the side of the
houseand Jimmie Dale sprang forward

There was the roar of a report a blinding flash almost in Jimmie Dales
eyes as Connie Myers whirling instantly at his entrance firedand
missed It happened quick then in the space of the ticking of a
watchbefore Jimmie Dale flinging himself forward had reached the
man Like a defiant challenge to their demand it must have seemed to the
officers outside that shot of Connie Myers at Jimmie Dale for it was
answered on the instant by another through the side window And the
shot fired at random the interior of the room hidden from the officers
outside by the drawn shades found its markand Connie Myers a bullet
in his brain pitched forward dead upon the floor

QUICK Jimmie Dale flung at Hagan Get that letter out of his hand
He jumped for the lamp on the floor extinguished it and turned again
toward Hagan Have you got it he whispered tensely

Yes said Hagan in a numbed way

This way then Jimmie Dale caught Hagans arm and pulled the other
across the room and into the kitchen to the trapdoor Quick he
breathed again Get down therequick And no noise They dont know
how many are in the house When they find HIM theyll probably be
satisfied

Hagan stupefied dazed obeyed mechanicallyand in an instant the
trapdoor closed behind them Jimmie Dale was standing beside the other
in the cellar

Not a sound now he cautioned once more

His flashlight winked went out winked again then held steadily in
curious fascination it seemed as in its circuit the ray fell upon
HaganFELL UPON THE TORN RAGGED EDGE OF A PAPER IN HAGANS HAND With
a suppressed cry Jimmie Dale snatched it away from the other It
was but a torn HALF of the letter The other half The other half
Haganwhere is it he demanded hoarsely

Hagan almost in a state of collapse muttered inaudibly The crash of a
toppling door sounded from above Jimmie Dale shook the man desperately

Where is it he repeated fiercely

Hehe was holding it tight itit tore in his hand Hagan stammered
Does it make any difference Oh lets get out of here whoever you
arefor Gods sake lets get out of here

Any difference Jimmie Dales jaws were clamped like a steel vise Any
difference The difference between life and death for the man beside
himthat was all He was reading the portion in his hand It was the
last part of the letter beginning with Theres a paper stuck under
the edge of Hagans table From above from the floor of the front
room now came the rush and trample of feet He could not go back for
the other half And any attempt to conceal the fact that Connie Myers
had been alone in the house was futile now They would find the torn
letter in the dead mans hand proof enough that some one else had been
there What was in that part of the letter that was still clutched in
that death grip upstairs A sentence from it that he had heard Connie
Myers read seemed to burn itself into his brain IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO DID IT LOOK IN MIKE HAGANS ROOM ON THE FLOOR ABOVE And then
suddenly like light through the darkness came a ray of hope He pulled
Hagan to the cellarway and stealthily lifted one side of the double
trapdoor There was a chance desperate enough one in a thousandbut
still a chance

Voices from the house came plainly now but there was no one in sight
The police to a man were evidently all inside From the road in front
showed the lamp glare of their automobile

Run for the car Jimmie Dale jerked out from between set teethand
with Hagan beside him steadying the man by the arm dashed across the
intervening fifty yards

They had not been seen A minute more and the car evidently belonging
to the local police for it was headed in the direction of New York and
as though it had come from Pelham swept down the road swept around a
turn and Jimmie Dale with a gasp of relief straightened up a little
from the wheel

How much time had he The police must have heard the car but equally
occupied as they were they might well give it no thought other than
that it was but another car passing by There was no telephone in the
house the nearest house was a quarter of a mile away and that might or
might not have a telephone Could he count on half an hour He glanced
anxiously at the crouched figure beside him He would have to It was
the only chance They would telephone the contents of the dead mans
half of the letter to the New York police Could he get to Hagans room
FIRST Look in Hagans room their part of the letter readbut it
did not say for WHAT or exactly WHERE If they found nothing Hagan was
safe Connie Myers reputation the fact that he was found in disguise
at Doyles house was barring any incriminating evidence quite enough
to let Hagan out There would only remain in the minds of the police the
question of who beside Connie Myers had been in old Doyles house that
night And now Jimmie Dale smiled a little whimsically Well perhaps he
could answer thatand if not quite to the satisfaction of the police
at least to the complete vindication of Mike Hagan

But he could not drive through towns and villages with a mask on his
face and there ahead now lights were beginning to show And more than
ever now with what was before him it was imperative that Mike Hagan
should not recognise Larry the Bat Jimmie Dale glanced again at
Haganand slowed down the car They were on the outskirts of a town
and off to the right he caught the twinkling lights of a street car

Hagan he said sharply pull yourself together and listen to me If
you keep your mouth shut youve nothing to fear if you let out a word
of whats happened tonight youll probably go to the chair for a crime
you know nothing about Do you understandkeep your mouth shut

The car had stopped Hagan nodded his head

All right then You get out here and take a street car into New
York continued Jimmie Dale crisply But when you get there keep away
from your home for the next two or three hours Hang around with some of
the boys you know and if youre asked anything afterward say you were
batting around town all evening Dont worryyoull find youre out of
this when you read the morning papers Now get outhurry He pushed
Hagan from the car Ive got to make my own getaway

Hagan standing in the road brushed his hand bewilderingly across his
eyes

Yesbut youI

Never mind about that Jimmie Dale leaned out and gripped Hagans
arm impressively Theres only one thing youve got to think of or
remember Keep your mouth shut No matter what happens keep your mouth
shutif you want to save your neck Goodnight Hagan

The car was racing forward again It shot streaking through the streets
of the town ahead and dully over its own inferno echoed shouts
cries and execrations of an outraged populacethen out into the night
again roaring its way toward New York

He had half an hourperhaps It was a good thing Hagan did not know or
had not grasped the significance of that torn letterthe man would have
been unmanageable with fear and excitement It would puzzle Hagan to
find no paper stuck under his table when he came to look for it But
that was a minor consideration that mattered not at all

Half an hour On roared the cartowns black roads villages wooded
lands were kaleidoscopic in their passing Half an hour Had he done it
Had he come anywhere near doing it He did not know He was in the city
at lastand now he had to moderate his speed but by keeping to the
less frequented streets he could still drive at a fast pace One piece
of good fortune had been histhe long motor coat he had found in the
car with which to cover the rags of Larry the Bat and without which he
would have been obliged to leave the car somewhere on the outskirts of
the city and to trust like Mike Hagan to other and slower means of
transportation

Blocks away from Hagans tenement he ran the car into a lane slipped
off the motor coat and from his pocket whipped out the little metal
insignia caseand in another moment a diamondshaped gray seal was
neatly affixed to the black ebony rim of the steering wheel He smiled
ironically It was necessary quite necessary that the police should
have no doubt as to who had been in Doyles house with Connie Myers that
night or to whom they had so considerately loaned their automobile

He was running nowthrough lanes dodging down side streets taking
every short cut he knew Had he beaten the police to Mike Hagans room
It would be easy then If they were ahead of him then by some means or
other he must still get that paper first

He was at the tenement nowshuffling leisurely up the steps The front
door was open He entered and went up the first flight of stairs then
along the hall and up the next flight He had half expected the place
to be bustling with excitement over the crime but the police evidently
had kept the affair quiet for he had seen no one since he had
entered But now as he began to mount the third flight he went more
slowlysome one was ahead of him It was very darkhe could not see
The steps above died away He reached the landing started along for
Hagans roomand a light blazed suddenly in his face and a hard
quick grip on his shoulder forced him back against the wall Then the
flashlight wavered glistened on brass buttons went out and a voice
laughed roughly

Its only Larry the Bat

Larry the Bat eh It was another voice harsh and curt What are you
doing here

He was not first after all The telephone message from Pelhamit was
almost certainly thathad beaten him They were ahead of him just
ahead of him they had only been a few steps ahead of him going up the
stairs just a second ahead of him on their way to Hagans room Jimmie
Dale was thinking fast now He must go tooto Hagans room with
themsomehowthere was no other waythere was Hagans life at stake

Aw I aint done nothin he whined I was just goin ter borrow the
price of a feed from Mike Haganlemme go

Hagan eh snapped the questioner Are you a friend of his

Sure I am

The officers whispered for a moment together

Well try it decided the one who appeared to be in command Were
in the dark anyhow and the thing may be only a steer Mabbe itll
workanyway it wont do any harm His hand fell heavily on Jimmie
Dales shoulder Mrs Hagan know you brusquely

Sure she does sniffled Larry the Bat

Good rasped the officer Well well make the visit with you And
you do what youre told or well put the screws on yousee Were
after something here and youve blown the whole gamesavvy Youve
spilled the gravyunderstand

In the darkness Jimmie Dale smiled grimly It was far more than he had
dared to hope forthey were playing into his hands

But I dont know bout any game grovelled Larry the Bat piteously

Who in hell said you did growled the officer Youre supposed to
have snitched the lay to us thats alland mind you play your part
Come on

It was two doors down the hall to Mike Hagans room and there one of
the officers putting his shoulder to the door burst it open and sprang
in The other shoved Jimmie Dale forward It was quickly done The three
were in the room The door was closed again

Came a cry of terror out of the darkness a movement as of some one
rising up hurriedly in bed and then Mrs Hagans voice

What is it Who is it Mike

The tableit was against the righthand wall Jimmie Date remembered
He sidled quickly toward it

Strike a light ordered the officer in charge

Jimmie Dales fingers were feeling under the edge of the tablea quick
sweep along itNOTHING He stooped reaching farther inanother sweep
of his armand his fingers closed on a sheet of paper and a piece of
hard gum In an instant they were in his pocket

A match crackled and flared up A lamp was lighted Larry the Bat sulked
sullenly against the wall

Terrorstricken wideeyed Mrs Hagan had clutched the child lying
beside her to her arms and was sitting bolt upright in bed

Now then no fuss about it said the officer in charge with brutal
directness You might as well make a clean breast of Mikes share in
that murder downstairsLarry the Bat here has already told us the
whole story Come on nowout with it

Murderher face went white My MikeMURDER She seemed for an
instant stunnedand then down the worn thin haggard face gushed the
tears I dont believe it she cried I dont believe it

Come on now cut that out prodded the officer roughly I tell you
Larry the Bat here has opened everything up wide Youre only making
it worse for yourself

Him She was staring now at Jimmie Dale Oh God she cried
So thats what you are are youa stoolpigeon for the cops Well
whatever you told them you lie Youre the curse of this neighbourhood
you are and if my Mike is bad at all its you thats helped to make
him bad But murderyou LIE

She had risen slowly from the beda gaunt pitiful figure pitifully
clothed the black hair graystreaked streaming thinly over her
shoulders still clutching the baby that too was crying now

The officers looked at one another and nodded

Guess shes handing it straightwell have a look on our own hook
the leader muttered

She paid no attention to themshe was walking straight to Jimmie Dale

Its you is it she whispered fiercely through her sobs that would
bring more shame and ruin hereyou thats selling my mans life away
with your filthy lies for what theyre paying youits you is it
that Her voice broke

There was a frightened uneasy look in Larry the Bats eyes his lips
were twitching weakly he drew far back against the walland then
glancing miserably at the officers as though entreating their
permission began to edge toward the door

For a moment she watched him her face white with outrage her hand
clenched at her sideand then she found her voice again

Get out of here she said in a choked strained way pointing to the
door Get out of hereyou dirty skate

Sure mumbled Larry the Bat his eyes on the floor Sure he
mumbledand the door closed behind him



PART TWO THE WOMAN IN THE CASE


CHAPTER I

BELOW THE DEAD LINE


Whisperings Always whisperings low sibilant floating errantly
from all sides until they seemed a component part of the drugladen
atmosphere itself And occasionally another sound the soft SLAPSLAP
of looseslippered feet the faint rustle of equally loosefitting
garments And everywhere the sweet sickish smell of opium It was Chang
Foos simply a cellar or two deeper in Chang Foos than that in which
Dago Jim had quarrelled onceand died

Larry the Bat viciousfaced unkempt disreputable lay sprawled out on
one of the dives bunks an opium pipe beside him But Larry the Bat was
not smoking instead his ear was pressed closely against the boarding
that formed the rather flimsy partition at the side of the bunk One
heard many things in Chang Foos if one cared to listenif one could
first win ones way through the carefully guarded gateway that to the
uninitiated offered nothing more interesting than the entrance to a
Chinese teashop and an uninviting one at that

HAD HE BEEN FOLLOWED IN HERE He had been shadowed for the last hour of
that at least he was certain Why By whom For an hour he had dodged
in and out through the dens of the underworld as only one who was at
home there and known to all could doand at last he had taken refuge in
Chang Foos like a fox burrowing deep into its hole

Few could find their way into the most infamous opium den in all New
York where not only the poppy ruled as master but where crime was
hatched ay and carried to its ghastly consummation sometimes as
well and of those few not one but was of the underworld itself And
it was that fact which held his muscles strained and rigid now under the
miserable rags that covered them and it was that which kept the keen
quick brain alert and active every faculty keyed up and tense If it
were the police he had little to fear for they could not force
their way in without warning but if it were the underworld he was in
imminent peril and had done little better than run himself into a trap
from which there was no escape

DEATH TO THE GRAY SEALhe had heard that whispered more than once in
this very place Who knew at what moment the role of Larry the Bat would
be uncovered and the underworld where now he held so high a place
would be at his throat like a pack of snarling wolves Who had been
shadowing him during the last hour

Whisperings Nothing tangible He could catch no words Only the
neverending whisperings of gathered groups here and thereand
sometimes the clink of coin where some game was in progress

The curtain before his bunk was drawn suddenly asideand Larry
the Bats fingers where his hand was carelessly hidden by his body
tightened upon his automatic

Smokee some more

The fingers relaxed It was only Sam Wah one of the attendants

Nix said Larry the Bat in a slightly muddled tone Got enough

The curtain fell into place again Larry the Bats lips set in a thin
smile Ultimately it made little difference whether it was the police or
the underworld The smile grew thinner It was the flip of a coin that
was all With one there was the death house at Sing Sing for the Gray
Seal with the otherwell there were many ways from a shot or a knife
thrust in the open street to his murder in some hidden dive like
this of Chang Foos for instance where he now wasthe Gray Seal was
responsible for the occupancy of too many penitentiary cells by those of
the underworld to look for any other fate

He raised himself up sharply on his elbow A shrill high note like
the scream of a parrakeet rang out a second time He tore the curtain
aside and jumped to his feet All around him in the twinkling of an
eye Chinamen in fluttering blouses chattering like magpies mingled
with snarling cursing whites were running madly A voice prefaced
with an oath bawled out behind him as he sprang forward and joined the
rush

Beat it De cops Beat it

The police A raid Was it for HIM From rooms an amazing number of
them more forms rushed out joined divided separated and dashed
some this way some that along branching passageways There had been
raids before the police had begun to change their minds about Chang
Foos but Chang Foos was not an easy place to raid House after house
in that quarter of Chinese laundries of tea shops of chopsuey joints
opened one into the other through secret passages in the cellars
Larry the Bat plunged down a staircase and halted in the darkness of
a cellar drawing back against the wall while the flying feet of his
fellow fugitives scurried by him

Was it for HIM this raid If not the police had not a hope of getting
him if he kept his head for back in Chang Foos proper which would be
quite closed off now Chang Foo would be blandly submitting to arrest
offering himself as a sort of glorified sacrifice while the police
confiscated opium and fantan layouts If the police had no other
purpose than that in mind Chang Foo would simply pay a fine the next
night the place would be in full blast again and Chang Foo higher than
ever in the confidence of the underworlds aristocracy would reap his
rewardand that would be all there was to it

But was that all The raid had followed significantly close upon the
heels of his entry into Chang Foos Larry the Bat began to move forward
again He dared not follow the others and later on when quiet was
restored issue out into the street from any one of the various houses
in which he might temporarily have taken refuge There was a chance in
that a chance that the police might be more zealous than usual even if
he particularly was not their gameand he could take no chance Arrest
for Larry the Bat even on suspicion could have but one conclusionnot
a pleasant onethe disclosure that Larry the Bat was not Larry the Bat
at all but Jimmie Dale the millionaire clubman and to complete a
fatal triplication that Larry the Bat and Jimmie Dale was the Gray Seal
upon whose head was fixed a price

All was silence around him now except that from overhead came
occasionally the muffled tread of feet He felt his way along into a
black narrow passage emerged into a second cellar swept the place
with a single circling gleam from a pocket flashlight passed a
stairway that led upward reached the opposite wall and dropping on
hands and knees crawled into what innocently enough appeared to be
the opening of a coal bin

He knew Chang Foos wellas he knew the ins and outs of every den and
place he frequented knew them as a man knows such things when his life
at any moment might hang upon his knowledge

He was in another passage now and this in a few steps brought him to
a door Here he halted and stood for a full five minutes absolutely
motionless absolutely still listening There was nothingnot a
sound He tried the door cautiously It was locked The slim sensitive
tapering fingers of Jimmie Dale unrecognisable now in the grimy digits
of Larry the Bat felt tentatively over the lock To fingers that seemed
in their tips to possess all the human senses that time and again
in their delicate touch upon the dial of a safe had mocked at human
ingenuity and driven the police into impotent frenzy this was a pitiful
thing From his pocket came a small steel instrument that was quickly
and deftly inserted in the keyhole There was a click the door swung
open and Jimmie Dale alias Larry the Bat stepped outside into a back
yard half a block away from the entrance to Chang Foos

Again he listened There did not appear to be any unusual excitement in
the neighbourhood From open windows above him and from adjoining houses
came the ordinary commonplace sounds of voices talking and laughing
even the queer weird notes of a Chinese chant He stole noiselessly
across the yard out into the lane and made his way rapidly along to
the cross street

In a measure now he was safe but one thing a very vital thing
remained to be done It was absolutely necessary that he should know
whether he was the quarry that the police had been after in the raid if
it was the police who had been shadowing him all evening If it was the
police there was but one meaning to itLarry the Bat was known to be
the Gray Seal and a problem perilous enough in any aspect confronted
him Dare he risk the Sanctuaryfor the clothes of Jimmie Dale Or was
it safer to burglarise as he had once done before his own mansion on
Riverside Drive

His thoughts were running riot and he frowned angry with himself
There was time enough to think of that when he knew that it was the
police against whom he had to match his wits

Well in the shadow of the buildings he moved swiftly along the side
street until he came to the corner of the street on which halfway down
the block fronted Chang Foos teashop A glance in that direction and
Jimmie Dale drew a breath of relief A patrol wagon was backed up to
the curb and a half dozen officers were busy loading it with what was
evidently Chang Foos far from meagre stock of gambling appurtenances
while Chang Foo himself together with Sam Wah and another attendant
were in the grip of two other officers waiting possibly for another
patrol wagon There was a crowd too but the crowd was at a respectful
distanceon the opposite side of the street

Jimmie Dale still hugged the corner A man swaggered out from a doorway
quite close to Chang Foos and came on along the street As the other
reached the corner Jimmie Dale sidled forward

Ello Chick he said out of the corner of his mouth Wots de lay

Ello Larry returned the other Aw nuthin De nutcracker on
Chang dats all

I tought mabbe dey was lookin for some guy dat was in dere observed
Jimmie Dale

Nuthin doin the other answered I was in dere meself De whole mob
beat it clean an de bulls never batted an eye Didnt youse pipe me
make me getaway outer Shanghais a minute ago De bulls never went
nowhere except into Changs Deres a new lootenant in de precinct
inaugeratin himself dats all Slong LarryI gotta date

Slong Chick responded Jimmie Daleand started slowly back along
the cross street

It was not the police then who were interested in his movements Then
who He shook his head with a little savage impotent gesture One
thing was clear it was too early to risk a return to the Sanctuary and
attempt the rehabilitation of Jimmie Dale If any one was on the
hunt for Larry the Bat the Sanctuary would be the last place to be
overlooked

He turned the next corner hesitated a moment in front of a garishly
lighted dance hall and finally shuffled in through the door made his
way across the floor nodding here and there to the elite of gangland
and with a somewhat arrogant air of proprietorship sat down at a table
in the corner Little better than a tramp in appearance certainly
the most disreputablelooking object in the place even the waiter who
approached him accorded him a certain curious deferencewas not Larry
the Bat the most celebrated dope fiend below the dead line

Gimme a mug o suds ordered Jimmie Dale and sprawled royally back in
his chair

Under the rim of his slouch hat pulled now far over his eyes he
searched the faces around him If he had been asked to pick the actors
for a revel from the scum of the underworld he could not have improved
upon the gathering There were perhaps a hundred men and women in
the room the majority dancing and with the exception of a few
sightseeing slummers they were men and women whose acquaintance with
the police was intimate but not cordialfar from cordial

Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders and sipped at the glass that had
been set before him It was grimly ironic that he should be not only
there but actually a factor and a part of the underworlds intimate
life He Jimmie Dale a wealthy man a member of New Yorks
exclusive clubs a member of New Yorks most exclusive society It was
inconceivable He smiled sardonically Was it Well then it was none
the less true His life unquestionably was one unique apart from any
other mans but it was for all that actual and real

There had been three years of it nowsince SHE had come into his life
Jimmie Dale slouched down a little in his chair The ice was thin
perilously thin that he was skating on now Each letter with its
demand upon him to match his wits against police or underworld or
against both combined perhaps made that peril a little greater a
little more imminentif that were possible when already his life
was almost literally carried daily hourly in his hand Not that he
rebelled against it it was worth the price that some day he expected
he must paythe price of honour wealth a name disgraced ruin death
Was he quixotic Immoderately so He smiled gravely Perhaps But he
would do it all over again if the choice were his There were those who
blessed the name of the Gray Seal as well as those who cursed it And
there was the Tocsin

Who was she He did not know but he knew that he had come to love her
come to care for her and that she had come to mean everything in life
to him He had never seen her to know her face He had never seen her
face but he knew her voiceay he had even held her for a moment the
moment of wildest happiness he had ever known in his arms That night
when he had entered his library his own particular den in his own
house and in the darkness had found her therefound her finally
through no effort of his own when he had searched so fruitlessly for
years to find her using every resource at his command to find her And
she because she had come of her own volition relying upon him had
held him in honour to let her go as she had comewithout looking upon
her face Exquisite irony But she had made him a promise thenthat the
work of the Gray Seal was nearly overthat soon there would be an end
to the mystery that surrounded herthat he should know allthat he
should know HER

He smiled again but it was a twisted smile on the mechanically
misshapen lips of Larry the Bat NEARLY over Who knew That nearly
might be too late Even tonight he had been shadowed was skulking even
now in this place as a refuge Who knew Another hour and the newsboys
might be shrieking their Uxtra Uxtra De Gray Seal caught De
millionaire Jimmie Dale de Jekyll an Hyde of real life

Jimmie Dale straightened up suddenly in his seat There was a shout
an oath bawled out high above the riot of noise a chorus of feminine
shrieks from across the room What was the matter with the
underworld tonight He seemed fated to find nothing but centres of
disturbancefirst a raid at Chang Foos and now this What was the
matter here They were stampeding toward him from the other side of
the room There was the roar of a revolver shotanother Black Ike He
caught an instants glimpse of the gunmans distorted face through the
crowd That was it probablya row over some moll

And then as Jimmie Dale lunged up from his chair to his feet to escape
the rush pandemonium itself seemed to break loose Yells shots
screams and oaths filled the air The crowd surged this way and that
Tables were overturned and sent crashing to the floor And then came
sudden darkness as some one of the attendants in misguided excitability
switched off the lights

The darkness but served to increase the panic not allay it With a
savage snap of his jaws Jimmie Dale swung from his table in the corner
with the intention of making his way out by a side door behind himit
was a case of the police again and the patrolman outside would probably
be pulling a riot call by now And the policeHe stopped suddenly
as though he had been struck An envelope thrust there out of the
darkness was in his hand and her voice HERS the Tocsins was
sounding in his ears

Jimmie Jimmie Ive been trying all evening to catch you Quick Get
to the Sanctuary and change your clothes Theres not an instant to
lose Its for my sake tonight

And then a surging mob was around him on every side and pushing
jostling half lifting him at times from his feet carried him forward
with its rush and with him in its midst burst through the door and out
into the street



CHAPTER II

THE CALL TO ARMS


Not a sound as the key turned in the lock not a sound as the door swung
back on its carefully oiled hinges not a sound as Larry the Bat slipped
like a shadow into the blackness of the room closing the door behind
him again With a tread as noiseless as a cats he was across the room
to satisfy himself that the shutters were tightly closed and then the
single gas jet flared up murky yellow illuminating the miserable
squalid roomthe Sanctuarythe home of Larry the Bat There was need
for silence need for caution In five minutes ten at the outside he
must emerge againas Jimmie Dale

With a smile on his lips that mingled curiously chagrin and
selfcommiseration he took the letter from his pocket and tore it open
It was she then who had been following him all evening and like a
blundering idiot he had wasted precious perhaps irreparable hours
What had she meant by Its for my sake tonight The words had been
ringing in his ears since the moment she had whispered them in that
panicstricken crowd Was it not always for her sake that he answered
these calls to arms Was it not always for her sake that he as the
Gray Seal wasThe mental soliloquy came to an abrupt end He had
subconsciously read the first sentence of the letter and now with
sudden feverish eagerness and excitement he was reading it to the last
word


DEAR PHILANTHROPIC CROOK In an hour after you receive this if all
goes well you shall know everythingeverything Who I amyes and
my name It has been more than three years now hasnt it It has been
incomprehensible to you but there has been no other way I dared not
take the chance of discovery by any one I dared not expose you to
the risk of being known by me Your life would not have been worth
a moments purchase Oh Jimmie am I only making the mystery more
mystifying But tonight I think I hope I pray that it is all at an
end though against me and against you tonight when you go to help
me is the most powerful and pitiless organisation of criminals that the
world has ever known and the stake we are playing for is a fortune of
millionsand my life And yet somehow I am afraid now just because the
end is so near and the victory seems so surely won And so Jimmie be
careful use all that wonderful cleverness of yours as you have never
used it before andBut there should be no need for that it is so
simple a thing that I am going to ask you to do Why am I writing so
illogically Nothing surely can possibly happen This is not like
one of my usual letters is it I am beside myself tonight with hope
anxiety fear and excitement

Listen then Jimmie Be at the northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and
Waverly Place at exactly halfpast ten A taxicab will drive up as
though you had signalled it in passing and the chauffeur will say
Ive another fare in half an hour sir but I can get you most
anywhere in that time You will be smoking a cigarette Toss it out
into the street make any reply you like and get into the cab Give the
chauffeur that little ring of mine with the crest of the bell and belfry
and the motto Sonnez le Tocsin that you found the night old Isaac
Pelina was murdered and the chauffeur will give you in exchange a
sealed packet of papers He will drive you to your home and I will
telephone to you there

I need not tell you to destroy this Keep the appointment in your
proper personas Jimmie Dale Carry nothing that might identify you
as the Gray Seal if any accident should happen And lastly trust the
pseudo chauffeur absolutely


There was no signature Her letters were never signed He stood for a
moment staring at the closely written sheets in his hand a heightened
colour in his cheeks his lips pressed tightly togetherand then his
fingers automatically began to tear the letter into pieces and the
pieces again into little shreds Tonight It was to be tonight the
end of all this mystery Tonight was to see the end of this dual life
of his with its constant peril Tonight the Gray Seal was to exit from
the stage forever Tonight a wonderful climax of the years he was to
see HER

His blood was quickened now his heart pounding in a faster beat a mad
elation a fierce uplift was upon him He thrust the torn bits of paper
into his pocket hurriedly stepped across the room to the corner rolled
back the oilcloth and lifted up the loose plank in the flooring so
innocently dustladen as more than once to have eluded the eyes of
inquisitive visitors in the shape of police and plain clothes men from
headquarters

From the space beneath he removed a neatly folded pile of clothes laid
these on the bed and began to undress He was working rapidly now Tiny
pieces of wax were removed from his nostrils from under his lips from
behind his ears water from a cracked pitcher poured into a battered tin
basin and mixed with a few drops of some liquid from a bottle which he
procured from its hiding place under the flooring banished the makeup
stain from his face his neck his wrists and hands as if by magic
It was a strange metamorphosis that had taken placethe coarse
brutalfeatured bleareyed leering countenance of Larry the Bat was
gone and in its place cleancut squarejawed cleareyed was the
face of Jimmie Dale And where before had slouched a slopeshouldered
misshapen flabby creature a broadshouldered form well over six feet
in height now stood erect and under the clean white skin the muscles
of an athlete like knobs of steel played back and forth with every
movement of his body

In the streaked and broken mirror Jimmie Dale surveyed himself
critically methodically and with a nod of satisfaction hastily
donned the fashionably cut suit of tweeds upon the bed He rummaged then
through the ragged garments he had just discarded transferred to
his pockets a roll of bills and his automatic and paused hesitantly
staring at the thin metal case like a cigarette case that he held in
the palm of his hand He shrugged his shoulders a little whimsically it
seemed strange indeed that he was through with that He snapped it
open Within between sheets of oil paper lay the scores of little
diamondshaped graycoloured adhesive paper sealsthe insignia of the
Gray Seal Yes it seemed strange that he was never to use another He
closed the case gathered up the clothes of Larry the Bat tucked
the case in among them and shoved the bundle into the hole under the
flooring All these things would have to be destroyed but there was not
time tonight tomorrow or the next day would do for that What would
it be like to live a normal life again without the menace of danger
lurking on every hand without that grim slogan of the underworld
Death to the Gray Seal or that savage fiat of the police The Gray
Seal dead or alivebut the Gray Seal forever ringing in his ears
What would it be like this new lifewith her

The thought was thrilling him again bringing again that eager exultant
uplift In an hour ONE hour and the barriers of years would be swept
away and she would be in his arms

Its for my sake tonight His face grew suddenly tense as the words
came back to him That hour wasnt over yet It was no hysterical
exaggeration that had prompted her to call her enemies the most powerful
and pitiless organisation of criminals that the world had ever known
It was not the Tocsins way to exaggerate The words would be literally
true The very life she had led for the three years that had gone stood
out now as a grim proof of her assertion

Jimmie Dale replaced the flooring carefully brushed the dust back into
the cracks spread the oilcloth into place and stood up Who and what
was this organisation What was between it and the Tocsin What was this
immense fortune that was at stake And what was this priceless packet
that was so crucial that meant victory now ay and her life too she
had said

The questions swept upon him in a sort of breathless succession Why had
she not let him play a part in this True she had told him whythat
she dared not expose him to the risk Risk Was there any risk that the
Gray Seal had not taken and at her instance He did not understand he
smiled a little uncertainly as he reached up to turn out the gas There
were a good many things that he did not understand about the Tocsin

The room was in darkness and with the darkness Jimmie Dales mind
centred on the work immediately before him To enter the tenement where
he was known and had an acknowledged right as Larry the Bat was one
thing for Jimmie Dale to be discovered there was quite another

He crossed the room opened the door silently stood for a moment
listening then stepped out into the black musty illsmelling hallway
closing the door behind him He stooped and locked it The querulous cry
of a child reached him from somewhere abovea murmur of voices muffled
by closed doors from everywhere How many families were housed beneath
that sordid roof he had never known only that there was miserable
poverty there as well as vice and crime only that Larry the Bat who
possessed a room all to himself was as some lordly and superbeing to
these fellow tenants who shared theirs with so many that there was not
air enough for all to breathe

He had no doors to passhis was next to the staircase He began to
descend They could scream and shriek those stairs like aged humans
twisted and rheumatic at the least ungentle touch But there was no
sound from them now There seemed something almost uncanny in the
silent tread Stair after stair he descended his entire weight thrown
gradually upon one foot before the other was lifted The strain upon the
muscles trained and hardened as they were told As he moved from the
bottom step he wiped little beads of perspiration from his forehead

The door now that gave on the alleyway He opened it slipped outside
darted across the narrow lane stole along where the shadows of the
fence were blackest paused listening as he reached the end of the
alleyway to assure himself that there was no nearby pedestrianand
stepped out into the street

He kept on along the block turned into the Bowery and under the first
lamp consulted his watch It was a quarter past ten He could make
it easily in a leisurely walk He continued on up the Bowery finally
crossed to Broadway and shortly afterward turned into Waverly Place
At the corner of Fifth Avenue he consulted his watch againand now he
lighted a cigarette Sixth Avenue was only a block away At precisely
halfpast ten to the second he halted on the designated corner
smoking nonchalantly

A taxicab coincidentally coming from an uptown direction swung in to
the curb

Taxi sir Yes sir Then with an admirable mingling of eagerness to
secure the fare and a fear that his confession might cause him the loss
of it Ive another fare in half an hour sir but I can get you most
anywhere in that time

Jimmie Dales cigarette was tossed carelessly into the street

St James Club he said curtly and stepped into the cab

The cab started forward turned the corner and headed along Waverly
Place toward Broadway The chauffeur twisted around in his seat in a
matteroffact way as though to ask further directions

Have you anything for me he inquired casually

It lay where it always lay that ring between the folds of that little
white glove in his pocketbook Jimmie Dale took it out now and handed
it silently to the chauffeur

The others face changed instantlycomposure was gone and a quick
strained look was in its place

Im afraid Ive been watched he said tersely Look behind you will
you and tell me if you see anything

Jimmie Dale glanced backward through the little window in the hood

Theres another taxi just turned in from Sixth Avenue he reported the
next instant

Keep your eye on it instructed the chauffeur shortly

The speed of the cab increased sensibly

With a curious tightening of his lips Jimmie Dale settled himself
in his seat so that he could watch the cab behind There was trouble
coming intuitively he sensed that and he reflected bitterly he might
have known It was too marvellous too wonderful ever to come to pass
that this one hour the thought of which had fired his blood and made
him glad beyond any gladness life had ever held for him before should
bring its promised happiness

Wheres the cab now the chauffeur flung back over his shoulder

They had passed Fifth Avenue and were nearing Broadway

About the same distance behind Jimmie Dale answered

That looks bad the chauffeur gritted between his teeth Well have
to make sure Ill run down Lower Broadway

If you think were followed suggested Jimmie Dale quietly why not
run uptown and give them the slip somewhere where the traffic is thick
Lower Broadway at this time of night is as empty and deserted as a
country road

The chauffeurs sudden laugh was mirthless

My God you dont know what you are talking about he burst out If
theyre following all hell couldnt throw them off the track And Ive
got to know Ive got to be SURE before I dare make a move tonight I
couldnt tell up in the crowded districts if I was followed could I
They wont come out into the open until their hands are forced

The car swerved sharply rounded the corner and speeding up faster and
faster began to tear down Lower Broadway

Watch WATCH cried the chauffeur

There was no word between them for a moment then Jimmie Dale spoke
crisply

Its turned the corner Its coming this way

The taxicab was rocking violently with the speed silent empty Lower
Broadway stretched away ahead Apart from an occasional street car
probably there would be nothing between them and the Battery Jimmie
Dale glanced at his companions face as a light flashing by threw
it into relief It was set and stern even a little haggard but too
there was something else there something that appealed instantly to
Jimmie Dalea sort of bulldog grit that dominated it

If he holds our speed well know the chauffeur was shouting now to
make himself heard over the roar of the car Look again Where is it
now

Once more Jimmie Dale looked through the little rear window The cab had
been a block behind them when it had turned the corner and he watched
it now in a sort of grim fascination There was no possible doubt of it
The two bobbing bouncing headlights were creeping steadily nearer And
then a sort of unnatural calm settled upon Jimmie Dale and his hand
went mechanically to his pocket to feel his automatic there as he
turned again to the chauffeur

If youve got any more speed youd better use it he said
significantly

The man shot a quick look at him

They are following us You are SURE

Yes said Jimmie Dale

The chauffeur laughed again in that mirthless savage way

Lean over here where I can talk to you he rasped out The games
up as far as I am concerned I guess But theres a chance for you
They dont know you in this

Give her more speedor dodge into a cross street suggested Jimmie
Dale coolly They havent got us yet by a long way

The other shook his head

Its not only that cab behind he answered through set lips You
dont know what were up against If theyre really after us theres
a trap laid in every section of this citythe devils Its the package
they want Thank God for the presentiment that made me leave it behind
I was going back for it you understand if I was satisfied that we
werent followed Listen Theres a chance for youtheres none for me
That packageremember thisno one else knows where it is and its
life and death to the one who sent you here Its in Box 428 atMy God
LOOK Look there he yelled and with a wrench at the wheel sent the
taxi lurching and staggering for the car tracks in the centre of the
street

The scene fast as thought itself was photographing itself in every
detail upon Jimmie Dales brain From the cross street ahead one from
each corner two motor cars had nosed out into Broadway blocking the
road on both sides And now the car on the lefthand side was
moving forward across the tracks to counteract the chauffeurs move
deliberately insuring a collision There was no chance no further
room to turn no time to stopthe man driving the other car jumped for
safetythey would be into it in an instant

Box 428 Jimmie pleaded fiercely Go on man Go on FINISH

Yes cried the chauffeur John Johansson at

But Jimmie Dale heard no more There was the crash of impact as the
taxicab plowed into the car that had been so craftily manoeuvered in
front of it and Jimmie Dale lifted from his feet was hurled violently
forward with the shock and all went black before his eyes



CHAPTER III

THE CRIME CLUB


For what length of time he had remained unconscious Jimmie Dale had not
the slightest idea He regained his senses to find himself lying on a
couch in a strange room that had a most exquisitely brasswrought dome
light in the ceiling That was what attracted his attention because
the light hurt his eyes and his head was already throbbing as though a
thousand devils were beating a diabolical tattoo upon it

He closed his eyes against the light Where was he What had happened
Oh yes he remembered now That smash on Lower Broadway He had been
hurt He moved first one limb and then another tentatively and was
relieved to find that though his body ached as if it had been severely
shaken and his head was bad he had apparently escaped without serious
injury

Where was he In a hospital His fingers resting at his side upon the
couch supplied him with the information that it was a very expensive
couch upholstered in finest leather If he were in a hospital he would
be in a cot

He opened his eyes again to glance curiously around him The room was
quite in keeping with the artistic lighting fixture and the refined if
expensive taste that was responsible for the couch A heavy velvet
rug of rich dark green was bordered by a polished hardwood floor
panellings of darkgreen frieze and beautifully grained woodwork made
the lower walls while above on a background of some softtoned paper
hung a few and evidently choice oil paintings There was a big
inviting lounging chair a massive writing table or more properly a
desk of walnut and behind the desk his back half turned apparently
intent upon a book sat a man in immaculate evening dress

Jimmie Dale closed his eyes again There was something reassuring about
it all comfortably reassuring Though why there should be any occasion
for a feeling of reassurance at all he could not for the moment make
out And then in a sudden flash the details of the night came back to
him The Tocsins letterthe package he was to getthe taxicabthe
chauffeur who was not a chauffeurthe chasethe trap He lay
perfectly still It was the professional Jimmie Dale now whose brain in
spite of the throbbing brutally aching head was at work keen alert

The chauffeur What had happened to him Had the man been killed in the
auto smash or less fortunate than himself fallen into the hands of
those whose power he seemed both to fear and rate so highly And that
package Boxwhat was the numberyes 428 What did that mean What
box Where was it Who was John Johansson He hadnt heard any more than
that the smash had come then And lastly he was back again to the
same question he had begun with Where was he now himself It looked as
though some good Samaritan had picked him up Who was this gentleman so
quietly reading there at the desk

Jimmie Dale opened his eyes for the third time How still how
absolutely silent the room was He studied the mans back speculatively
for a moment then his gaze travelled on past the man to the wall
riveted there and his fingers without movement of his arm pressed
against the outside of his coat pocket He thought as much His
automatic was gone

Not a muscle of Jimmie Dales face moved His eyes shifted to a picture
on the wall THE MAN WAS WATCHING HIMNOT READING Just above the level
of the desk a small mirror held the couch in focusbut equally
it held the man in focus and Jimmie Dale had seen the others eyes
through a black mask that covered the face to the top of the upper lip
fixed intently upon him

There was a chill now where before there had been reassurance something
ominous in the very quiet and refinement of the room and Jimmie Dale
smiled inwardly in bitter ironyhis good Samaritan wore a mask His
selfcongratulations had come too soon Whatever had happened to the
chauffeur it was evident enough that he himself was caught What was it
the chauffeur had said Something about a chance through being unknown
Was it to be a battle of wits then God if his head did not ache so
frightfully It was hard to think with the brain half sick with pain

Those two eyes shining in that mirror There seemed something horribly
spectrelike about it He did not look again but he knew they were
there It was like a cat watching a mouse Why did not the man speak
or move or do something andHe turned his head slowly the man was
laughing in a low amused way

You appear to be taken with that picture observed a pleasant voice
Perhaps you recognise it from there It is a Corot

Jimmie Dale with a wellsimulated start sat upand with another
quite as well simulated stared at the masked man The other had laid
down his book and swung around in his chair to face the couch Jimmie
Dale stood up a little shakily

Look here he said awkwardly II dont quite understand I remember
that my taxi got into a smashup and I suppose I have to thank you for
the assistance you must have rendered me only as I sayhe looked in
a puzzled way around the room and in an even more perplexed way at the
mask on the others faceI must confess I am at a loss to understand
quite the meaning of this

Suppose that instead of trying to understand you simply accept things
as you find them The voice was soft but there was a finality in it
that its blandness only served to make the more suggestive

Jimmie Dale drew himself up and bowed coldly

I beg your pardon he said I did not mean to intrude I have only to
thank you again then and bid you goodnight

The lips beneath the mask parted slightly in a politely deprecating
smile

There is no hurry said the man a sudden sharpness creeping into his
tones I am sorry that the rule I apply to you does not work both ways
For instance I might be quite at a loss to account for your presence in
that taxicab

Jimmie Dales smile was equally polite equally deprecating

I fail to see how it could be of the slightest possible interest to
you he replied However I have no objection to telling you I hailed
the taxi at the corner of Sixth Avenue and Waverly Place told the
chauffeur to drive me to the St James Club and

The St James Club broke in the other coldly is I believe north
not SOUTH of Waverly Placeand on Broadway not at all

Jimmie Dale stared at the other for an instant in patient annoyance

I am quite well aware of that he said stiffly Nevertheless I told
the man to drive me to the St James Club We came across Waverly Place
but on reaching Broadway instead of turning uptown he suddenly whirled
in the other direction and sent the car flying at full speed down Lower
Broadway I shouted at the man I dont know yet whether he was drunk
or crazy orJimmie Dales eyes fixed disdainfully on the others
maskwhether there might not after all have been method in his
madness I can only say that before we had gone more than two or three
blocks a wild effort on his part to avoid a collision with an auto
swinging out from a side street resulted in an even more disastrous
smash with another on the other side and I was knocked senseless

Victim I presume is the idea you desire to convey observed the
other evenly You were quite the victim of circumstances as it were

Jimmie Dales eyebrows lifted slightly

It would appear to be fairly obvious I should say

Very clever commented the man But now suppose we remove the buttons
from the foils His voice rasped suddenly You are quite as well aware
as I am that what has happened tonight was not an accident Norin
case the possibility may have occurred to youare the police any the
wiser save for the existence of two wrecked cars on Lower Broadway and
another which escaped and for which doubtless they are still searching
assiduously The ownership of the taxicab you so inadvertently entered
they will have no difficulty in establishingyou perhaps however
are in a better position than I am to appreciate the fact that the
establishment of its ownership will lead them nowhere As I understand
it the man who drove you tonight obtained the loan of the cab from one
of the companys chauffeurs in return for a hundreddollar bill Am I
right

In view of what has happened admitted Jimmie Dale simply I should
not be surprised

There was a sort of sardonic admiration in the others laugh

As for the other car he went on I can assure you that its ownership
will never be known When the nearest patrolman rushed up there were
no survivors of the disaster save those in the third car which he was
powerless to stopwhich accounts for your presence here You will admit
that I have been quite frank

Oh quite said Jimmie Dale a little wearily But would you mind
telling me what all this is leading to

The man had been leaning forward in his chair one hand palm downward
resting lightly on the desk He shifted his hand now suddenly to the arm
of his chair

THIS he said and on the desk where his hand had been lay the
Tocsins gold signet ring

Jimmie Dales face expressed mild curiosity He could feel the others
eyes boring into him

We were speaking of ownership said the man in a low menacing
tone I want to know where the woman who owns this ring can be found
tonight

There was no play no trifling here the man was in deadly earnest But
it seemed to Jimmie Dale even with the sense of peril more imminent
with every instant that he could have laughed outright in savage
mockery at the irony of the question Where was she Even WHO was she
And this was the hour in which he was to have known

May I look at it he requested calmly

The other nodded but his eyes never left Jimmie Dale

It will give you an extra moment or so to frame your answer he said
sarcastically

Jimmie Dale ignored the thrust picked up the ring examined it
deliberately and set it back again on the table

Since I do not know who owns it he said I cannot answer your
question

No Well then there is still another mattera little package that
was in the taxicab with you Where is that

See here said Jimmie Dale irritably This has gone far enough I
have seen no package large or small or of any description whatever
You are evidently mistaking me for some one else You have only to
telephone to the St James Club He reached toward his pocket for his
cardcase My name is

Dale supplied the other curtly Dont bother about the card Mr
Dale We have already taken the liberty of searching you He rose
abruptly from his chair I am afraid you do not quite realise your
position Mr Dale he said with an ominous smile Let me make
it clear I do not wish to be theatrical about this but we do not
temporise here You will either answer both of those questions to my
satisfaction OR YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE THIS PLACE ALIVE

Jimmie Dales face hardened His eyes met the others steadily

Ah I think I begin to see he said caustically When I have been
thoroughly frightened I shall be offered my freedom at a price A sort
of uptodate game of holdup The penalty of being a wealthy man If you
had named your figure to begin with we would have saved a lot of idle
talk and you would have had my answer the sooner NOTHING

Do you know said the other in a grimly musing way there has always
been one man but only one until now that I have wished I might add
to my present associates I refer to the socalled Gray Seal Tonight
there are two I pay you the compliment of being the other Buthe was
smiling ominously againwe are wasting time Mr Dale I am willing to
expose my hand to the extent of admitting that the information you are
withholding is infinitely more valuable to me than the mere wreaking of
reprisal upon you for a refusal to talk Therefore if you will answer
I pledge you my word you will be free to leave here within five minutes
If you refuse you are already aware of the alternative Well Mr
Dale

Who was this man Jimmie Dale was studying the others chin the lips
the white even teeth the jetblack hair Some day the tables might be
turned Could he recognise again this cool imperturbable ruffian who so
callously threatened him with murder

Well Mr Dale I am waiting

I am not a magician said Jimmie Dale contemptuously I could not
answer your questions if I wanted to

The others hand slid instantly to a row of electric buttons on the
desk

Very well Mr Dale he said quietly You do not believe I see that
I would dare to carry my threat into execution you perhaps even doubt
my power I shall take the trouble to convince youI imagine it will
stimulate your memory

The door opened Two men were standing on the threshold both in evening
dress both masked The man behind the desk came forward took Jimmie
Dales arm almost courteously and led him from the room out into a
corridor where he halted abruptly

I want to call your attention first Mr Dale to the fact that as far
as you are concerned you neither have now nor ever will have any idea
whether you are in the heart of New York or fifty miles away from it
Now listen Do you hear anything

There was nothing Only the strange silence of that other room was
intensified now There was not a sound stillness such as it seemed to
Jimmie Dale he had never experienced before was around him

You may possibly infer from the silence that you are NOT in the city
suggested the other after a moments pause I leave you to your own
conclusions in that respect The cause however of the silence is
internal not external we had soundproof principles in mind to a
perhaps exaggerated degree when this building was constructed If you
care to do so you have my permission to shout say for help to your
hearts content We shall make no effort to stop you

Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders He was staring down a brilliantly
lighted richly carpeted corridor There were doors on one side windows
on the other the windows all hung with heavy closely drawn portieres
The corridor was certainly not on the ground floor but whether it was
on the second or third or even above that again he had no means of
knowing From appearances though the place seemed more like a large
private mansion than anything else

Just one word more before we proceed continued the other I do not
wish you to labour under any illusion Here we are frankly criminals
This is our home It should have some effect in impressing you with the
power and resource at our command and also with the class of men with
whom you are dealing There is not one among us whose education is not
fully equal to your own not one indeed but who is chosen granting
first his criminal tendencies because he is a specialist in his own
particular fieldin commerce in the government diplomatic service in
the professions of law and medicine in the ranks of pure science
We are bordering on the fantastical are we not Dreaming you will
probably say of the Utopian in crime organisation Quite so Mr Dale
I only ask you to consider the POSSIBILITIES if what I say is true Now
let us proceed I am going to take you into three roomsthe three whose
doors you see ahead of you You will notice that including the one you
have just left there are four on this corridor I do not wish to strain
your credulity or play tricks upon you so I am going to ask you to fix
an approximate idea of the length of the corridor in your mind as it
will perhaps enable you to account more readily for what may appear to
be a discrepancy in the corresponding size of the rooms

One of the men opened the door ahead Jimmie Dale at a sign from his
conductor moved forward and entered Just what he had expected to find
he could not have told his brain was whirling partly from his aching
head partly from his desperate effort to conceive some way of escape
from the peril which for all his nonchalance he knew only too well
was the gravest he had ever faced but what he saw was simply a cozily
furnished bedroom There was nothing peculiar about it nothing out of
the way except perhaps that it was rather narrow

And then suddenly rubbing his eyes involuntarily he was staring in a
dazed way before him The whole righthand side of the wall was sinking
without a sound into the floor increasing the width of the room by some
five or six feetand in this space was disclosed what appeared to be a
sort of chemical laboratory elaborately equipped extending the entire
length of the room

The wall is purely a matter of mechanical construction operated
hydraulically The man was speaking softly at Jimmie Dales side
The room beneath is built to correspond the base ceiling and wall
mouldings here do not have to be very ingenious to effect a disguise
I might say however that few visitors other than yourself have ever
seen anything here but a bedroom He waved his hand toward the retorts
the racks of test tubes the hundred and one articles that strewed the
laboratory bench As for this its purpose is twofold We as well
as the police have often need of analysis We make it If we require a
drug a poison say we compound it from its various ingredients or
as the case may be distil it perhapsit is you will agree somewhat
more difficult to trace to its source if procured that way And speaking
of poisonshe stepped forward and lifted a glassstoppered bottle
containing a colourless liquid from a shelfin a modest way we have
even done some original research work here This for instance is
as Utopian from our standpoint as the formation and personnel of the
organisation I have briefly outlined to you It possesses very essential
qualities It is almost instantaneous in its action requires a very
small quantity and defies detection even by autopsy He uncorked the
bottle and dipped in a long glass rod Will you watch the experiment
he invited with a sort of ghastly pleasantry I do not want you to
accept anything on trust

With a start Jimmie Dale swung around He had heard no sound but
another man was at his elbow nowand struggling in the mans hand was
a little white rabbit

It was over in an instant A single drop in the rabbits mouth and the
animal had stiffened out a lifeless thing

It is quite as effective on the human organism continued the other
only instead of one drop three are required If I make it tenhe
was carefully measuring the liquid into two wineglassesit is only
that even you may be satisfied that the quantity is fatal He filled up
the glasses with what was apparently wine of some description which he
poured from a decanter and held out the glasses in front of him

And again Jimmie Dale started again he had heard no one enter and yet
two men had stepped forward from behind him and had taken the glasses
from their leaders hands He glanced around him counting quicklythey
were surely the two who had entered with him from the corridor No
Including the leader there were now six men all in evening dress all
masked in the room with him

A wave of the leaders hand and the two men holding the glasses left
the room The man turned to Jimmie Dale again

Shall we proceed to the second room Mr Dale he asked politely
I think it is now prepared for usI do not wish to bore you with a
repetition of magical sliding walls

There was something now that numbed the ache in Jimmie Dales braina
sense of some deadly remorseless thing that seemed to be constantly
creeping closer to him clutching at himto smother him to choke him
There was something absolutely fiendish terrifying in the veneer of
culture around him

They had entered the second room This like the other was a
pseudobedroom but here the movable wall was already down Ranged along
the righthand side were a great number of cabinets that slid in and
out much after the style and fashion used by clothing dealers to stock
and display their wares These cabinets were now all open displaying
hundreds of costumes of all kinds and descriptions and evidently
complete to the minutest detail The cabinets were flanked by
fulllength mirrors at each end of the room and on little tables before
the mirrors was an assortment that none better than Jimmie Dale himself
could appreciate of makeup accessories

The man smiled apologetically

I am afraid this is rather uninteresting he said I have shown it to
you simply that you may understand that we are alive to the importance
of detail Disguise that is daily vital to us is an art that depends
essentially on detail I venture to say we could impersonate any
character or type or nationality or class in the United States at a
moments notice Buthe took Jimmie Dales arm again and conducted him
out into the corridor while the two men who were evidently acting
the role of guards followed closely behindthere is still the third
roomhere He halted Jimmie Dale before the door I have asked you
to answer two questions Mr Dale he said softly I ask you now to
remember the alternative

They still stood before the door There was that uncanny silence
againit seemed to Jimmie Dale to last interminably Neither of the
three men surrounding him moved nor spoke Then the door before him was
opened on an unlighted room and he was led across the threshold He
heard the door close behind him The lights came on And then it seemed
as though he could not move as though he were rooted to the spotand
the colour ebbed from his face Three figures were before him the two
men who had carried the glasses from the first room and the chauffeur
who had driven him in the taxicab The two men still held the
glassesthe chauffeur was bound hand and foot in a chair One of the
glasses was EMPTY the other was still significantly full

Jimmie Dale with a violent effort at selfcontrol leaned forward

The man in the chair was dead



CHAPTER IV

THE INNOCENT BYSTANDER


There was not a sound That stillness weird unnerving that permeated
as it were everywhere through that mysterious house was if that were
possible accentuated now The four masked men in evening dress five
including their leader for the man who had appeared in that other room
with the rabbit was not here were as silent as motionless as the dead
man who was lashed there in the chair And to Jimmie Dale it seemed at
first as though his brain stunned and stupefied at the shock refused
its functions and left him groping blindly vaguely with only a
sort of dull subconscious realisation of menace and a deadly peril
imminent hanging over him

He tried to rouse himself mentally to prod his brain to action to
pit it in a fight for life against these selfconfessed criminals and
murderers with their mask of culture who surrounded him now Was there
a way out What was it the Tocsin had saidthe most powerful and
pitiless organisation of criminals the world has ever knownthe stake a
fortune of millionsher life There had indeed been no overemphasis
in the words she had used They had taken pains themselves to make that
ominously clear these men Every detail of the strange house with its
luxurious furnishings its cleverly contrived appointments breathed
a horribly suggestive degree of power a deadly purpose and an
organisation swayed by a master mind and grim evidence of the
merciless inexorable length to which they would go was the ghastly
white face of the dead chauffeur bound hand and foot in the chair
before him

That EMPTY glass in the hand of one of the men He could not take his
eyes from itexcept as his eyes were drawn magnetically to that FULL
glass in the hand of one of the others What height of sardonic irony
He was to drink that other glass to die because he refused to answer
questions that for years with every resource at his command risking
his liberty his wealth his name his life with everything that he
cared for thrown into the scales he had struggled to solveand failed

And then the leader spoke

Mr Dale he said with cold significance I regret to admit that
your pseudo taxicab driver was so illadvised as to refuse to answer the
SAME questions that I have put to you

Five to one That was the only way outand it was hopeless It was the
only way out because convinced that he could answer those questions if
he wanted to these men were in deadly earnest it was hopeless because
they werefive to one And probably there were as many more twice or
three times as many more within call But what did it matter how many
more there were He could fight until he was overpowered that was all
he could do and the five could accomplish that Still if he could
knock the full glass out of that mans hand and gain the door then
perhapshe turned quickly as the door opened It was as though they
had read his thoughts A number of men were grouped outside in the
corridor then the door closed again with a cordon ranged against it
inside the room and at the same instant his arms and wrists were caught
in a powerful grasp by the two men immediately behind him who all along
had enacted the role of guards

Again the leader spoke

I will repeat the questions he said sharply Where is the woman
whose ring was found on that man there in the chair And where is the
package that you two men had with you in the taxicab tonight

Jimmie Dale glanced from the tall straight immaculately clothed figure
of the speaker from the threatening smile on the set lips that just
showed under the edge of the mask to the dead man in the chair He had
faced the prospect of death before many times but it had come with the
heat of passion accompanying it it had come quickly abruptly with
every faculty called into action to combat it without time to dwell
upon it to sift weigh or measure its meaning and if there had been
fear it had been subordinate to other emotions But it was different
now He could not of course answer those questions nor he was
doggedly conscious would he have answered them if he couldand there
was no middle course

Death within the next few moments stared him in the face and it
seemed curiously irrelevant that in a sort of unnatural calmness he
should be attempting to analyse his feelings and emotions concerning it
All his life it had seemed to him that the acme of human mental
torture was the cell of a condemned criminal with the horror of its
hopelessness with the time to dwell upon it and that the acme of
that torture itself must be that awful moment immediately preceding
execution when anticipation at last was to merge into soulsickening
reality

Strange that thought should come Strange that he should be framing a
brain picture of such a scene vivid minute in detail Nonot strange
He was picturing himself The analogy was not perfect it was true he
had not had the months weeks days and hours of suspense but it was
perfect enough to bring home to him with appalling force the realisation
of his position He was standing as a condemned man might stand in those
last final moments those moments which he had imagined must be the
most terrible that could exist in life but that dismay of soul the
horror the terror were not histhere was instead a smouldering fury
a passionate amazement that it was his own life that was threatened It
seemed impossible that it could be his voice that was speaking now in
such quiet measured tones

Is it worth while will it convince you now any more than before to
repeat that there is some mistake here I am no more able to answer your
questions than you are yourselves I never saw that man in the chair
there in my life until the moment that I hailed him in his cab tonight
I do not know who the woman is to whom that ring belongs much less do
I know where she is And if there was a package of any sort in the
taxicab as you state I never saw it

The lips under the mask curved into a lupine smile

Think well Mr Dale The mans voice was low menacing Ethically
if you so choose to consider it your refusal may be the act of a brave
man practically it is the act ofa fool Nowyour answer

I have answered you said Jimmie Daleand relaxing the muscles in
his arms let them hang limply for an instant in the grip of the two men
behind him I have no other answer

It was only a sign a motion of the leaders handbut with it quick
as a lightning flash Jimmie Dale was in action The limp arms tautened
into steel as he wrenched them loose and whirling around he whipped
his fist to the chin of one of the two guards

In an instant with the blow as the man staggered backward the room
was in pandemonium There was a rush from the door and two three four
leaping forms hurled themselves upon Jimmie Dale He shook them offand
they came again There was no chance ultimately he knew that it was
only the elemental within him that rose in fierce revolt at the thought
of tame submission that bade him sell his life as dearly as he could
Panting gasping for breath dragging them by sheer strength as they
clung to him he got his back to the wall fighting with the savage fury
and abandon of a wild cat

But it could not last Where one man went down before him two
remorselessly appearedthe room seemed filled with menthey poured in
through the doorhe laughed at them in a halfdemented waymore
and more of them camethere was no play for his arms no room to
fightthey seemed so close around him so many of them upon him that
he could not breatheand he was bending being crushed down as by an
intolerable weight And then his feet were jerked from beneath him he
crashed to the floor and in another moment bound hand and foot he
was tied into a chair beside that other chair whose grim occupant sat in
such ghastly apathy of the scene

The room cleared instantly of all but the original five His head was
drawn suddenly violently backward and clamped in that position and
a metal instrument forced into his mouth while his lips bled in their
resistance pried jaws apart and held them open

One drop the leader ordered curtly

The man with the full glass bent over him and dipped a glass rod into
the liquid The drop glistened a ruby red on the end of the rodand
fell with a sharp acrid burning sensation upon Jimmie Dales tongue

For a moment Jimmie Dales animation mental and physical seemed swept
away from him in as it were a hiatus of hideous suspense What was it
to be like this passing Why did it not act at once as it had acted on
the rabbit they had showed him in the other room Yes he remembered
It took more than one drop for a man and besides this was diluted
One drop had no effect on a man it requiredGood God ONE DROP EVEN
OF THIS WAS ENOUGH He strained forward in the chair until the sweat in
great beads sprang from his forehead strained and fought and tore at
his bonds in a paroxysm of madness to free himself while there still
remained a little strength There was something filming before his eyes
a numbed feeling was creeping through his limbs robbing them sapping
them of their vitality and power He felt himself slipping away into a
state of utter weakness and his brain began to grow confused

A voice seemed to float in the air near him For the last timewill
you answer

With a supreme effort Jimmie Dale strove to rally his tottering senses
Did they not understand the stupendous mockery of their questions Did
they not understand that he did not know He had told them soperhaps
he had better tell them so again

I He tried to speak and found the words thick upon his tongue
Ido notknow

The glass itself was thrust abruptly between his lips Some of the
contents spilled and trickled upon his chin and then a flood of it
burning fiery poured down his throat A flood of itand it needed but
THREE drops and there had been TEN in the glass

So this was deatha hazy nebulous thing There was no pain It was
likelikenothingness And out of the nothingness SHE came Strange
that she should come Alone she had fought these fiends and outwitted
them forhow long was it Three years She would be more than ever
alone now Pray God she did not finally fall into their clutches

How it burned now that fatal draught they had forced down his throat
and how it gripped at him and seemed to eat and bore its way into the
very tissues It was the end andno It was STIMULATING him Strength
seemed to be returning to his limbs it seemed as though he were being
carried as though the bonds about him were being loosened and now his
brain seemed to be growing clearer

He roused up with a startled exclamation He was back in the same room
in which he had first returned to consciousness after the accident He
was on the same couch The same masked figure was at the same desk Had
he been dreaming Was this then only some horrible ghastly nightmare
through which he had passed

No it had been real enough his clothes rent and torn and the blood
upon his hands where the skin had been scraped from his knuckles in the
fight bore evidence to that He must then have lost consciousness for
a while though it seemed to him that at no moment hazy irrational
though his brain might have been had he become entirely oblivious to
what was taking place around him And yet it must have been so

The eyes from behind the mask were fixed steadily upon him and below
the mask there was the hard unpleasant set to the lips that Jimmie Dale
had grown accustomed to expect

The man spoke abruptly

That you find yourself alive Mr Dale he said grimly is no
confession of weakness upon the part of those with whom you have had to
deal here To bear witness to that there is one who is not alive as you
have seen That man we knew With you it was somewhat different Your
presence in the taxicab was only suspicious There was always the
possibility that you might be one of those ubiquitous innocent
bystanders Your name your position the improbability that you could
have anything in common withshall we say the matter that so deeply
interests uswas all in your favour However presumption and
probability are the tools of fools We do not depend upon themwe apply
the test And having applied the test we are convinced that you have
told the truththat is all

He rose from his chair brusquely I shall not apologise to you for what
has happened I doubt very much if you are in a frame of mind to accept
anything of the sort I imagine rather that you are promising yourself
that we shall pay and pay dearly for thisthat among other things
we shall answer for the murder of that man in the other room All this
will be quite within your province Mr Daleand quite fruitless
Tomorrow morning the story that you are preparing to tell now would
sound incredible even in your own ears furthermore as we shall take
pains to see that you leave this place with as little knowledge of its
location as you obtained when you arrived your story even if believed
would do little service to you and less harm to us I think of nothing
more Mr Dale except There was a whimsical smile on the lips now
Ah yes the matter of your clothes We can and shall be glad to make
reparation to you to the slight extent of offering you a new suit before
you go

Jimmie Dale scowled Sick shaken and weak as he was the cool
imperturbable impudence of the man was fast growing unbearable

The man laughed I am sure you will not refuse Mr Dalesince we
insist The condition of the clothes you have on at present mightI say
mightin a measure support your story with some degree of tangible
evidence It is not at all likely of course but we prefer to discount
even so remote a possibility When you have changed you will be motored
back to your home I bid you goodnight Mr Dale

Jimmie Dale rubbed his eyes The man was gonethrough a door at the
rear of the desk a door that he had not noticed before that was not
even in evidence now that was simply a movable section of the wall
panellingand for an instant Jimmie Dale experienced a sense of
sickening impotence It was as though he stood defenceless unarmed
and utterly at the mercy of some venomous power that could crush what it
would remorselessly and at will in its might

The place was a veritable maze a lair of hellish cleverness He had
no illusions now he laboured under no false estimate of either the
ingenuity or the resources of this inhuman nest of vultures to whom
murder was no more than a matter of detail And it was against these men
that henceforth he was to match his wits There could be no truce no
armistice It was their lives or hers or his Well he was alive now
the first round was over and so far he had won His brows furrowed
suddenly Had he He was not so sure after all He was conscious of a
disquieting premonitory intuition that in some way which he could not
explain the honours were not entirely his

He was apparentlythe apparently was a mental reservationquite
alone in the room He got up from the couch and walked shakily across
the floor to the desk A revolver lay invitingly upon the blotting pad
It was his own the one they had taken from him after the accident
Jimmie Dale picked it up examined itand smiled a little sarcastically
at himself for his trouble It was unloaded of course He was twirling
it in his hand as a man masked as every one in the house was masked
and carrying a neatly folded suit over his arm entered from the
corridor

The car is ready as soon as you are dressed announced the other
briefly He laid the clothes upon the couchand settled himself
significantly in a chair

Jimmie Dale hesitated Then with a shrug of his shoulders recrossed
the room and began to remove his torn garments What was the use They
would certainly have their own way in the end It wasnt worth another
fight and there was nothing to be gained by a refusal except to offer a
sop to his own exasperation

He dressed quickly in what proved to be an exceedingly wellfitting
suit and finally turned tentatively to the man in the chair

The other stood up and produced a heavy black silk scarf

If you have no objections he said curtly Ill tie this over your
eyes

Again Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders

I am glad enough to get out on any conditions he answered
caustically

Fortunate would be the better word rejoined the other
meaninglyand deftly knotting the scarf led Jimmie Dale blindfolded
from the room



CHAPTER V

ON GUARD


Was he in the city In a suburban town On a country road It seemed
childishly absurd that he could not at least differentiate to that
extent and yet from the moment he had been placed in the automobile
in which he now found himself he was forced to admit that he could not
tell He had started out with the belief that knowing New York and its
surroundings as minutely as he knew them it would be impossible do
what they would to prevent it that at the end of the journey he should
be without a clew and a very good clew at that to the location of what
he now called appropriately enough it seemed the Crime Club

But he had never ridden blindfolded in a car before He could see
absolutely nothing And if that increased or accentuated his sense of
hearing it helped littlethe roar of the racing car beat upon his
eardrums the more heavily that was all He could tell of course the
nature of the roadbed They were running on an asphalt road that was
obvious enough but city streets and suburban streets and hundreds of
miles of country road around New York were of asphalt

Traffic He was quite sure for he had strained his ears in an effort to
detect it that there was little or no traffic but then it must be
one or two oclock in the morning and at that hour the city streets
certainly those that would be chosen by these men would be quite as
deserted as any country road And as for a sense of direction he had
none whatevereven if the car had not been persistently swerving and
changing its course every little while If he had been able to form even
an approximate idea of the compass direction in which they had started
he might possibly have been able in a general way to counteract this
further effort of theirs to confuse him but without the initial
direction he was essentially befogged

With these conclusions finally thrust home upon him Jimmie Dale
philosophically subordinated the matter in his mind and leaning back
composed himself as comfortably as he could upon his seat There was a
man beside him and he could feel the legs of two men on the seat facing
him These with the driver would make four He was still well guarded
The car itself was a closed carnot hooded the sense of touch told
himtherefore a limousine of some description These facts in a sense
inconsequential were absorbed subconsciously and then Jimmie Dales
brain remorselessly active in spite of the pain from his throbbing
head was at work again

It seemed as though a year had passed since in the early evening as
Larry the Bat he had burrowed so ironically for refuge in Chang Foos
denfrom her It seemed like some mocking unreality some visionary
dream that so short a while before he had read those words of hers
that had sent the blood coursing and leaping through his veins in mad
exultation at the thought that the culmination of the years had come
that all he longed for hoped for that all his soul cried out for was
to be hisin an hour An HOURand he was to have seen her the woman
whose face he had never seen the woman whom he loved And the hour
instead the hours since then had brought a nightmare of events so
incredible as to seem but phantoms of the imagination

Phantoms He sat up suddenly with a jerk The face of the dead
chauffeur the limp form lashed in that chair the horrible picture in
its entirety every detail standing out in ghastly relief took form
before him God knew there was no phantom there

The man beside him at the sudden start lifted a hand and felt
hurriedly over the bandage across Jimmie Dales eyes

Jimmie Dale was scarcely conscious of the act With that face before
him with the scene reenacting itself in his mind again had come
another thought staggering him for a moment with the new menace that it
brought He had had neither time nor opportunity to think before it had
been all horror all shock when he had entered that room But now like
an inspiration he saw it all from another angle There was a glaring
fallacy in the game these men had played for his benefit tonighta
fallacy which they had counted on glossing over as it had indeed been
glossed over by the sudden shock with which they had forced that scene
upon him or failing in that they had counted on the fact that his
or any other mans nerve would have failed when it came to open defiance
based on a supposition which might after all be wrong and being
wrong meant death

But it was not supposition Either he was right now or these men were
childish immature foolsand whatever else they might be they were
not that NOT A SINGLE DROP OF POISON HAD PASSED THE CHAUFFEURS LIPS
The man had not been murdered in that room He had not in a sense been
murdered at all The man absolutely unquestionably without a loophole
for doubt had either been killed outright in the automobile accident
or had died immediately afterward probably without regaining
consciousness certainly without supplying any of the information that
was so determinedly sought

Yes he saw it now Their backs were against the wall they were at
their wits end these men The knowledge that the chauffeur possessed
that they KNEW he possessed was evidently life and death to them To
kill the man before they had wormed out of him what they wanted to know
or at least until by holding him a prisoner they had exhausted every
means at their command to make him speak was the last thing they would
do

Jimmie Dale sat for a long time quite motionless The car was speeding
at a terrific rate along a straight stretch of road He could almost
have sworn guided by some intuitive sense that they were in the
country Well even if it were so what did that prove They might
have started FROM New York itselfonly to return to it when they had
satisfied themselves that he was sufficiently duped Or they might have
started legitimately from outside New York and be going toward the city
now Since the ultimate destination was New York and they had made no
attempt to hide that from him it was useless to speculatefor at best
it could be only speculation He had decided that once before The man
at his side felt again over the scarf to see that it was in place

Curiously now Jimmie Dale recalled the inward monitor that had warned
him the honours had not all been his in this first round with the Crime
Club tonight If they had deliberately murdered the chauffeur because
of a refusal to answer they would equally have done the same to him
Fool that he had been not to have seen that before And yet would it
have made any difference He shook his head He could not have acted to
any better advantage than he had done He could nothis lips curled in
grim derisionhave been any more convincing

Convincing It was all clear enough now If the chauffeur had suffered
death rather than talk even admitting the fact that they had more
grounds for suspecting the chauffeurs complicity would his Jimmie
Dales mere denial his choice too of death have been any the more
convincing or have saved his life where it had not saved the others
A certain added respect for these men against whom until the end now
his victory or theirs he realised he was fighting for his life came
over him as he recognised the touch of a master hand They did not know
where to find the Tocsin the package that she had said was vital to
them was still beyond their reach the chauffeur was dead and he
Jimmie Dale alone remaineda clew that they had still to prove valid
or invalid it was true but the only clew in their possession And
gaining nothing from him by a show of force to throw him off his guard
they had let him gomeaning him to believe they were convinced he knew
nothing and that the episode the adventure of the night was as far
as they were concerned ended finished and done with

Time passed a very long time as he sat there It might have been an
hourhe could only hazard a guess Not one of the men in the car
had spoken a word But to Jimmie Dale the car itself the ride its
duration these three strange companions were for the time being
extraneous Even that sick giddiness in his head had at least
temporarily gone from him

And so all unsuspectingly he was to lead them to the Tocsin and fall
into the trap himself His hands thrust deep in his pockets were
tightly clenched They were clever enough ingenious enough powerful
enough to watch him henceforth at every turnand from now on day and
night they were to be reckoned with Suppose that in some way as it
might well have happened for it was now vitally necessary that she
should communicate with him and he with her he had played blindly into
their hands and through him she should have fallen into their power It
brought a sickening chill a sort of hideous panic to Jimmie Daleand
then fury anger in a torrent surged upon him and there came a
merciless desire to crush to strangle to stamp out this inhuman band
of criminals that with intolerable effrontery to the laws of God and
man were so elaborately and scientifically equipped for their monstrous
purposes

And then Jimmie Dale in the darkness smiled again grimly as the
leaders reference to the Gray Seal recurred to him Well perhaps who
knew they would have reason more than they dreamed of to wish the
Gray Seal enrolled in their own ranks It was strange curious He had
thought all that was ended Only a few short hours before he had hidden
away all everything that was incident to the life of the Gray Seal the
clothes of Larry the Bat that little metal case with the graycoloured
adhesive seals a dozen other things believing that it only remained
for him to return and destroy them at his leisure as a finishing touch
to the Gray Seals careerand now instead he was face to face with
the gravest and most dangerous problem that she had ever called upon him
to undertake

Well at least the odds were not all in the Crime Clubs favour Where
they now certainly believed him to be entirely off his guard he was
thoroughly on his guard and where they might suspect him watch him
they would suspect and watch only the character the person of Jimmie
Dale and count not at all upon either Larry the Bat orthe Gray Seal

A sort of savage elation fell upon Jimmie Dale His brain that had been
stagnant confused physically sick with pain and suffering was working
now with its oldtime vigour and ease mapping planning scheming the
way ahead To strike and strike quicklyto strike FIRST It must be
his move nextnot theirs And he must act tonight at once the moment
he was given this pretence to liberty that they had in store for him
before they had an opportunity of closing down around him with a network
of spies that he could not elude By morning Jimmie Dale would be Larry
the Bat and inhabiting the Sanctuary again And a tip to Jason his
old butler to the effect say that he had gone away for a trip
would account for his disappearance satisfactorily enough it would not
necessarily arouse their suspicions when they eventually discovered he
was gone for against that was always the possible and quite likely
presumption that where they had succeeded in nothing else they had
at least succeeded in frightening him thoroughly and to the extent of
imbuing him with a hasty desire to put a safe distance between himself
and them

And now with his mind made up to his course of action an intense
impatience to put his plan into effect an irritation at the useless
twistings and turnings of the car that had latterly become more
frequent took hold upon him How much longer was this to last They
must have been fully an hour and a half on the road already andah
the car was stopping now

He straightened up in his seat as the machine came to a haltbut the
man at his side laid a restraining hand upon him The car door opened
and one of the men got out Jimmie Dale caught an indistinct murmur of
voices from without then the man returned to his seat and the car went
on again

Another half hour passed that curbing his irritation and impatience
was filled with the conjectures and questions that anew came crowding in
upon his mind Why had the car made that stop It was rather curious It
was certainly a prearranged meeting place Why And these clothes that
he now worewhy had they made him change His own had not been very
badly torn The reason given him was on the face of it now in view
of what he now knew mere pretence What was the ulterior motive behind
that pretence What did this package that had already cost a man his
life tonight contain Who was the chauffeur What was this death feud
between the Tocsin and these men Did she know where the Crime Club was
Who and where was John Johansson What was this box that was numbered
428 Could she supply the links that would forge the chain into an
unbroken whole

And then for the second time the car slowed downand this time the man
on the seat beside Jimmie Dale reached up and untied the scarf

You get out here said the man tersely



CHAPTER VI

THE TRAP


Had it not been for the stop the car had previously made for the
possibility that he might have obtained a glimpse outside when the door
had been opened the scarf over his eyes would have been superfluous
for now with it removed he could scarcely distinguish the forms of the
three men around him since the window curtains of the car were tightly
drawn Nor was he given the opportunity to do more even had it been
possible The car stopped the door was opened he was pushed toward
itand even as he reached the ground the door was closed behind him
and the car was speeding on again But where he could not see before
it took now but a glance to obtain his bearingshe was standing on a
corner on Riverside Drive within a few doors of his own house

Jimmie Dale stood still for a moment watching the car as it disappeared
rapidly up the Drive And with a sort of grim facetiousness his brain
began to correlate time and distance Where had he come from Where
was this Crime Club They had been as nearly as he could estimate two
hours in making the journey and as nearly as he could estimate in
their turnings and twistings had covered at least twice the distance
that would be represented by a direct route Granting then an average
speed of forty miles an hour which was overgenerous to be on the safe
side and the fact that they certainly had not crossed the Hudson which
now lay before him flanking the Drive the Crime Club was somewhere
within the area of a semicircle whose centre was the corner on which he
now stood and whose radius was forty milesOR FORTY YARDS He forced
a laugh It was just that no more no lesshe was as likely to have
started on his ride from within a biscuit throw of where he now stood
as to have started on it from miles away

Buthe aroused himself with a starthe was wasting time It must be
very late near morning and he would have need for every moment that
was left between now and daylight He turned walked quickly to his
house mounted the steps and with his latchkeythey had at least
permitted him to retain the contents of his pockets when they had forced
him to change his clothesopened the front door softly and stepping
inside closed the door as silently as he had opened it

He paused for an instant to listen There was not a sound The servants
naturally would have been in bed hours ago Even old JasonJimmie Dale
smiled half whimsically half affectionatelywhose paternal custom it
was to sit up for his Master Jim who as he was fond of saying he had
dandled as a baby on his knee had evidently given it up as a bad job
on this occasion and had turned in himself Jason however had left the
light burning here in the big reception hall

Jimmie Dale stepped to the switch and turned off the light then stood
hesitant in the darkness Was there anything to be gained by rousing
Jason now and telling him what he intended to doto instruct him to
answer any inquiries by the statement that Mr Dale had gone away for
a trip He could trust Jason Jason already knew muchmore than one
of those mysterious letters of the Tocsins had passed through Jasons
hands

Jimmie Dale shook his head No he could communicate with Jason from
downtown in the morning He had half expected to find Jason up and
in that case would have taken the other as far as necessary into
his confidence but it was not a matter that pressed for the moment He
could get into touch with Jason at any time readily enough Was there
anything else before he went He would not be able to get back as easily
as he got out Money He shook his head againa little grimly this
time He had been caught once before as Larry the Bat without funds
There was plenty of money now hidden in the Sanctuary enough for any
emergency enough to last him indefinitely

He stepped forward along the hall his tread noiseless on the rich
heavy rug passed into the rear of the house descended the back stairs
and reached the cellar It was below the level of the ground of course
but a narrow window here though quite large enough to permit of egress
gave on the driveway at the side of the house that led to the garage in
the rear

Cautiously now for the cement flooring was in the stillness little
less than a sounding board Jimmie Dale reached the wall and felt along
it to the window the lower edge of whose sill was just slightly below
the level of his shoulder It opened inward if he remembered correctly
His fingers were feeling for the fastenings It was too dark to see
a thing He muttered in annoyance Where were the fastenings At
the sides or at the bottom His hand began to make a circuit of the
silland then suddenly with a low sharp cry he leaned forward

WHAT DID THIS MEAN Wires No wires had ever been there before His
fingers were working now with feverish haste telegraphing their message
to his brain The wires ran through the sill close to the corner of
the walltiny fragments of wood as from an auger were still on the
silland here was a small particle of wire insulation that those
sensitive finger tips proclaimed was FRESH

A cold thrill ran through Jimmie Dale and there came again that
sickening sense of impotency in the face of the malignant devilish
cunning arrayed against him that once before he had experienced that
night He had thought to forestall themand he had been forestalled
himself This could only have been donethey had had no interest in
him before thenwhile they held him at the Crime Club while he was
spending that two hours in the car Was that why they had taken so long
in coming Was that why the car had stopped that timethat those with
him might be told that the work here had been completed and he need no
longer be kept away

He edged away from the window and as cautiously as he had come
retraced his steps across the cellar and up the stairsand then the
possibility of being heard from without gone he broke into a run There
was no need to wonder long what those wires meant They could mean only
one of two thingsand the Crime Club would have little concern in his
electric light THEY HAD TAPPED HIS TELEPHONE The mains he knew
ran into the cellar from the underground service in the street He was
racing like a madman now How long ago how many hours ago had they
done that Great Scott SHE was to have telephoned Had she done so Was
the game all everything she herself at their mercy already If she
had telephoned Jason would have left a message on his deskhe would
look there firstafterward he would waken Jason

He gained the door of his den on the first landing a room that ran the
entire length of one side of the house from front to rear burst in
switched on the lightand stood stockstill in amazement

Jason he cried out

The old butler fully dressed rubbing and blinking his eyes at the
light and with a startled cry rose up from the depths of a lounging
chair

Jason exclaimed Jimmie Dale again

I beg pardon sir Master Jim stammered the man II must have
fallen asleep sir

Jason what are you doing here Jimmie Dale demanded sharply

Well sir said Jason still fumbling for his words itit was the
telephone sir

TheTELEPHONE

Yes sir A woman begging your pardon Master Jim a lady sir has
been telephoning every hour or so and she

YES Jimmie Dale had jumped across the room and had caught the other
fiercely by the shoulder Yesyes What did she say QUICK man

Good Lord Master Jim faltered Jason Ishe

Jason said Jimmie Dale suddenly as cold as ice what did she say
Think man Every word

She didnt say anything Master Jim Nothing at all sirexcept to
keep asking each time if she could speak to you

Nothing else Jason

No sir

You are SURE

Im sure Master Jim Not another thing but that sir just as Ive
told you

Thank God said Jimmie Dale in a low voice

Yes sir said Jason mechanically

How long ago was it since she telephoned last asked Jimmie Dale
quickly

Well sir I couldnt rightly say You see as I said Master Jim I
must have gone to sleep but

They were staring tensely into each others face The telephone on the
desk was ringing vibrantly clamourously through the stillness of the
room

Jason white frightened bewildered touched his lips with the tip of
his tongue

Thatll be her again sir he said hoarsely

Wait said Jimmie Dale tersely

He was trying to think to think faster than he had ever thought before
He could not tell Jason to say that he had not yet come inTHEY knew he
was in it would be but showing his hand to that some one who would
be listening now on the wire He dared not speak to her or above all
allow her to expose herself by a single inadvertent word He dared not
speak to herand she was here now calling him He could not speak
to herand it was life and death almost that she should know what had
happened life and death almost for both of them that he should know all
and everything she could tell him True it would take but a minute
to run to the cellar and cut those wires while Jason held her on the
pretence of calling him Jimmie Dale to the phone only a minute to
cut those wiresand in so doing advertise to these fiends the fact that
he had discovered their trick admit as though in so many words that
their suspicions of him were justified lay himself open to some new
move that he could not hope to foresee and paramount to all else rob
her and himself of this master trump the Crime Club had placed in his
hands by means of which there was a chance that he could hoist them
with their own petard

The telephone rang againimperatively persistently

Listen Jason Jimmie Dale was speaking rapidly earnestly Say that
Ive come in and have gone to bedin a vile humour That you told me a
lady had been calling but that I said if she called again I wasnt
to be disturbed if it was the Queen of Sheba herselfthat I wouldnt
answer any phone tonight for anybody Do you understand No argument
with herjust that Now answer

Jason lifted the receiver from the hook

Yeshello he said Yes maam Mr Dale has come in but he has
retired    Yes I told him but begging your pardon maam he
was in what I might say was a bit of a temper and said he wasnt to be
disturbed by any one

Jimmie Dale snatched the receiver from Jason and put it to his own ear

Kindly tell Mr Dale that unless he comes to the phone now a
feminine voice her voice in wellsimulated indignation was saying
it will be a very long day before I shall trouble myself to

Jimmie Dale clapped his hand firmly over the mouthpiece of the
instrument Thank God for that clever brain of hers She understood

Repeat what you said before Jason he instructed hurriedly Then say
Goodnight

He removed his hand from the mouthpiece

Its quite useless maam said Jason apologetically In the rare
temper he was in he wouldnt come to use his own words maam not for
the Queen of Sheba herself maam Goodnight maam

Jimmie Dale hung the receiver back on the hookand with his hand
flirted away a bead of moisture that had sprung to his forehead

Good Lord Master Jim whats wrong sir Whats happened sir
Andand those clothes Master Jim sir They arent the ones you went
out in sirthey arent yours at all sir Jason ventured anxiously

Jason said Jimmie Dale switch off the light and go to the front
window and look out Keep well behind the curtains Dont show yourself
Tell me if you see anything

Yes sir said Jason obediently

The light went out Jimmie Dale moved to the rear of the roomto the
window overlooking the garage and yard

I dont see anything sir Jason called

Watch Jimmie Dale answered

A minute passedtwothree Jimmie Dale was staring down into the black
of the yard She understood She knew of course before she phoned
that something had gone wrong tonight She knew that only peril of the
gravest moment would have kept him from the phoneand her She knew
now as a logical conclusion that it was dangerous to attempt to
communicate with him at his home Those wires Where did they lead to
Not far awaythat would be almost a mechanical impossibility Was it
into the Crime Club itselfnear at hand Or the basement say of that
apartment house across the driveway Orwhere

And then Jimmie Dale spoke again

Do you see anything Jason

Im not sure sir Jason answered hesitantly I thought I saw a man
move behind a tree out there across the road a minute ago sir Yes
sirthere he is again

There was a thin mirthless smile on Jimmie Dales lips

Below in the shadow of the garage a dark form like a deeper shadow
stirredand was still again

What time is it Jason Jimmie Dale asked presently

Itll be about halfpast four sir

Go to bed Jason

Yes sir butJasons voice low troubled came through the darkness
from the upper end of the roomMaster Jim sir I

Go to bed Jasonand not a word of this

Yes sir Goodnight Master Jim

Goodnight Jason

Jimmie Dale groped his way to the big lounging chair in which he had
found Jason asleep and flung himself into it They had struck quickly
these ingenious dresssuited murderers of the Crime Club The house
was already watched would be watched now untiringly unceasingly not a
movement of his henceforth but would be under their eyes

His hands resting on the arms of the chair closed slowly until they
became tightclenched knotted fists What was he to do It was not only
the Crime Club it was not only the Tocsin and her perilthere was the
underworld snapping and snarling at his heels there was the police
dogged and sullen ever on the trail of the Gray Seal His life even
before this in his fight against the underworld and the police had
depended upon his freedom of actionand now at one and the same time
that freedom was cut away from beneath his feet as it were and a third
foe equally as deadly as the others was added to the list

For months to preserve and sustain the character of Larry the Bat he
had been forced to assume the role almost daily for in that sordid
empire below the dead line whose one common bond and aim was the
Gray Seals death where suspicion one of the other was rampant and
extravagant where each might be the one against whom all swore their
vengeance Larry the Bat could not mysteriously disappear from his
accustomed haunts without inviting suspicion in an active and practical
forman inquisitorial visit to his squalid lodgings the Sanctuaryand
the end of Larry the Bat

If as he had thought only a few hours before he was through forever
with his dual life that would not have mattered the underworld would
have been welcome to make what it chose of itbut now the preservation
of the character of Larry the Bat was more vital and necessary to him
than it had ever been before It was a means of defense and offense
against these men who lurked now outside his doors It was the sole
means now of communication with her for warned both by Jasons
words and what must be an obvious fact to her that their plans had
miscarried that it was dangerous to communicate with him as Jimmie
Dale she would expect him count on him to make that move There
would be no longer either reason or attempt on her part to maintain the
mystery with which she had heretofore surrounded herself the crisis
had come she would be watching waiting hoping seeking for him
more anxiously and with far more at stake than he had ever sought for
heruntil now

He got up impulsively from his chair and in the blackness began to
pace the room The next move was clear pitifully clear it had been
clear from the first it had been clear even in that ride in the carit
was so clear that it seemed veritably to mock him as he prodded his
brains for some means of putting it into execution He must get to the
Sanctuary become Larry the Batbut how HOW The question seemed at
last to become resonant to ring through the room with the weight of
doom upon it

Schemes plans ideas came bringing a momentary upliftonly to be
discarded the next instant with a sort of bitter desperate regret
These men were not men of mere ordinary intelligence their cleverness
their power the amazing scope of their organisation all bore grim
witness to the fact that they would be blinded not at all by any paltry
ruse

He could walk out of the house in the morning as Jimmie Dale without
apparent hindrancethat was obvious enough And so long as he pursued
the usual avocations of Jimmie Dale he would not be interfered
withonly WATCHED It was useless to consider that plan for a moment
It would not help him to reach the Sanctuarywithout leading them there
behind him True there was always the chance that he might shake them
off his trail but he could hardly hope to accomplish anything like that
without their knowing that it was done DELIBERATELYand that he dared
not risk The strongest weapon in his hands now was his secret knowledge
that he was being watched

That telephone there for instance that most curiously kept on
insisting in his mind that it and it alone was the way out was the
last thing he could place in jeopardy Besides there was another reason
why such a plan would not do for granting even that he succeeded in
eluding them on the way and managed to reach the Sanctuary his freedom
of action would be so restricted and limited as to be practically
worthlesshe would have to return to his home here again within a
reasonable time as Jimmie Dale within a few hours at mostor again
they would be in possession of the fact that he had discovered their
surveillance

That it was true had been his original plan when he had entered the
house half an hour previously but it was an entirely different matter
now Then he had counted on GETTING AWAY without their knowing it
before they as he had fondly thought would have had a chance to
establish their espionage and when they would have had no reason to
suspect for a time at least that he was not still within the house
when they would have been watching as it were an empty cage

He stopped in his walk and after a moment dropped down into the
lounging chair again That was it of course An empty cage If he could
escape from the house Not so much without their seeing him that
was more or less a mechanical detail But escapeand leave them in
possession of a sort of guarantee or assurance that he was still there
That would give him the freedom of action that he must have He smiled
with bitter irony That solved the problem That was all there was
to itjust that It was very simple exceedingly simple it was
onlyimpossible

The smile left his lips and once more his hands clenched fiercely No
it was not impossible It MUST be doneif he was to win through if
he was even to save himself It must be doneor FAIL her It COULD be
done there was a wayif he could only see it



CHAPTER VII

THE HOUR


As the minutes passed many of them Jimmie Dale sat there motionless
staring before him at the desk that was faintly outlined in the
unlighted room Then somewhere in the house a clock struck the hour
Five oclock He raised his head YES It could be done There was a
way He had the germ of it now And now the plan began to grow to take
form and shape in his mind to dovetail to knit the integral parts into
a comprehensive whole There was a waybut he must have assistance
Jasonyes assuredly Benson his chauffeuryes equally as
trustworthy as Jason Benson was devoted to him and moreover Benson was
young alert daring cool He had had more than one occasion to test
Bensons resourcefulness and nerve

Jimmie Dale rose abruptly went to the rear window and parting the
curtains cautiously stood peering down into the courtyard Yes it
was feasible even a little more than feasible The garage fronted the
driveway of course to give free entrance and egress to the cars but
where the wall of the garage and the rear wall of the house overlapped
as it were the space between them was not much more than ten yards
and here the shadows of the two walls mingling lay like a black
impenetrable pathwaynot like that other shadow he had seen moving at
the side of the garage and that if not for the moment discernible was
none the less surely still lurking there

Satisfied Jimmie Dale swung briskly from the window and going now
to his bedroom across the hall undressed and went to bedbut not to
sleep There would be time enough to sleep all day if he wished now
there were still the little details to be thought out that more than
anything else could make or wreck his plans A point overdone the
faintest suggestion of a false note where men of the calibre of those
against whom he was now fighting for his life were concerned would
not only make his scheme abortive but would place him utterly at their
mercy

It was nine oclock when he rang for Jason

Jason he said abruptly as the other entered I want you to
telephone for Doctor Merlin

The doctor sir exclaimed the old man anxiously Youreyoure not
ill Master Jim sir

Do I look ill Jason inquired Jimmie Dale gravely

Well sir admitted Jason in concern a bit done up sir perhaps A
little pale sir though Im sure

Im glad to hear it said Jimmie Dale sitting up in bed The worse I
look the better

II beg pardon sir stammered Jason

Jason said Jimmie Dale gravely again you have had reason to know
that on several occasions my life has been threatened It is threatened
now You know from last night that this house is now watched You
may or you may not have surmisedthat our telephone wires have been
tapped

Tapped sirJasons face had gone a little gray

Yes a party line so to speak said Jimmie Dale grimly Do you
understand You must be careful to say no more no less than exactly
what I tell you to say Now go and telephone Ask the doctor to come
over and see me this morning Simply say that I am not feeling well but
that apart from being apparently in a very nervous condition you do
not know what is the matter

Yes sirgood Lord sir gasped Jasonand left the room to carry out
his orders

An hour later Doctor Merlin had been and goneand had left two
prescriptions one written the other verbal With the written one
Benson in his chauffeurs livery was dispatched to the drug store the
verbal one was precisely what Jimmie Dale had expected from the fussy
old family physician Two or three days of quiet in the house James
and if you need me again let me know

Now Jason said Jimmie Dale when the old man had returned from
ushering Doctor Merlin from the house our friends out there will be
anxious to learn the verdict I was to dine with the RossHendersons
tomorrow night was I not

Yes sir I think so sir

Make sure said Jimmie Dale Look in my engagement book there on the
table

Jason looked

Yes sir thats right he announced

Very good said Jimmie Dale softly Now go and telephone again
Jason Present my regrets and excuses to the RossHendersons and say
that under the doctors orders I am confined to the house for the next
few daysand Jason

Yes sir

When Benson returns with the medicine let him bring it here
himselfand I shall want you as well

Jimmie Dale propped himself up a little wearily on the pillows as Jason
went out of the room After all his condition was not entirely feigned
He was as a matter of fact pretty well played out both mentally and
physically Certainly that he should require a doctor and be confined
to the house could not arouse suspicion even in the minds of those
alert aristocratic thugs of the Crime Club prone as they would be
to suspect anythinga man who had been knocked unconscious in an
automobile smash the night before had been in a fight had been
subjected to a terrific mental shock to say nothing of the infernal
drug that had been administered to him might well be expected to be
indisposed the next morning and for several mornings following that
It might indeed even cause them to relax their vigilance for the time
beingthough he dared build nothing on that Well he had only to coach
Benson and Jason in the parts they were to play and the balance of the
morning and all the afternoon was his in which to rest

He reached over to the table picked up a pencil and paper and began to
jot down memoranda He had just tossed the pencil back on the table as
the two men entered

Jason at a sign closed the door quietly

Jimmie Dale looked at Benson half musingly half whimsically for a
moment before he spoke

Benson he said the back seat of the large touring car is hinged and
lifts up once the cushion is removed doesnt it

Yes sir Benson answered promptly

And theres space enough for say a man inside isnt there

Why yes sir I suppose soat a squeezeBenson stared blankly

Quite so said Jimmie Dale calmly Now another matter Benson I
believe some chauffeurs have a habit when occasion lends itself of
taking shall we say their best girl out riding in their masters
machines

SOME might Benson replied a little stiffly I hope you dont think
sir that

One moment Benson The point is its donequite generally

Yes sir

And you have a best girl or at least could find one for such a
purpose if you were so inclined

Yes sir said Benson but

Very good Jimmie Dale interrupted Then tonight Benson taking
advantage of my illness and tomorrow night and the nights after
that until further notice you will acquire and put into practice that
reprehensible habit

II dont understand Mr Dale

No I dare say not said Jimmie Daleand then the whimsicality
dropped from him Benson he said slowly do you remember a night
nearly four years ago the first night you ever saw me You had
indiscreetly I think displayed more money than was wise in that East
Side neighbourhood

I remember said Benson with a sudden start then simply I wouldnt
be here now sir if it hadnt been for you

Well said Jimmie Dale quietly the tables are turned today Benson
As Jason already knows this house is watched For reasons that I cannot
explain I am in great danger Bluntly I am putting my life in your
handsand Jasons

Benson looked for an instant from Jimmie Dale to Jason caught the
strained troubled expression on the old mans face then back again at
Jimmie Dale

Dye mean that sir he cried Then you can count on me Mr Dale to
the last ditch

I know that Benson Jimmie Dale said softly And now both of you
listen It is imperative that I should get away from the house and
equally imperative that those watching should believe that I am still
here Not even the servants are to be permitted a suspicion that I am
not here in my bed ill That Jason is your task You will allow
no one to wait on me but yourself you will bring the meal trays up
regularlyand eat the food yourself You will answer all inquiries
telephone and otherwise in personI am not seeing any one You
understand perfectly Jason

I understand Master Jim You need have no fear sir on that score

Now you Benson Jimmie Dale went on A few minutes ago I sent
you out in your chauffeurs togs with that prescription You were
undoubtedly observed I wanted you to be It was quite necessary that
they should know and be able to recognise you againto disabuse their
minds later on of the possibility that I might be masquerading in your
clothes and also of course that they should know who you were and
what your position was in the household Very well Tonight at eight
oclock exactly you are to go out from the back door of the house to
the garage On the way outit will be quite dark thenI want you to
drop something say a bunch of keys that you had been jingling in your
hand You are to experience some difficulty in finding it again move
about a little to force any one that may be lurking by the garage to
retreat around the corner Grumble a bit and make a little noise but
you are not to overdo ita couple of minutes at the outside is enough
by that time I shall be under the car seat You will then run the
machine out to the street and stop at the curb jump out and as though
you had forgotten something hurry back to the garage You must not be
away longenough only to permit say a passerby to glance into the
car and satisfy himself that it is empty You understand of course
Benson that the hood must be downno closed car to invite even the
suggestion of concealmentthat would be a fatal blunder Drive then
to the young ladys home by as direct a route as you cangive no
appearance of being aware that you are followed as you will be and
much less the appearance of attempting to elude pursuit Act naturally
Between here and your destination I will manage readily enough to leave
the car You will then take the young lady for her drivethat is what
they will be interested inyour motive for going out tonight And as
I said take her driving again on each succeeding nightestablish the
HABIT to their satisfaction

Jimmie Dale paused glanced at the paper which he still held in his
hand then handed it to Benson

Just one thing more Benson he said Listed on that paper you will
find a different rendezvous for each night for the next five nights
excluding tonight which after you have returned the young lady to her
home you are to pass by on your way back here See that your drive is
always over in time for you to pass each nights rendezvous at half
past eleven sharp Dont stop unless I signal you If I am not there
go right on home and be at the next place on the following night I am
fairly well satisfied they will not bother about you after tonight
or tomorrow night at the most but for all that you must take no
chances so except in the route you take in going to the young ladys
always avoid covering the same ground twice which might give the
appearance of having some ulterior purpose in vieweven in your drives
vary your runs Is this clear Benson

Yes sir said Benson earnestly

Very well then said Jimmie Dale Eight oclock to the dot
Bensoncompare your time with Jasons And now Jason see that I get a
chance to sleep until dinner time tonight

The hours that followed were hours of sound and muchneeded sleep for
Jimmie Dale and from which he awoke only on Jasons entrance that
evening with the dinner tray

Ive slept like a log Jason he cried briskly as he leaped out of
bed Anything newanything happened

No sir not a thing Jason answered Only Master Jim sirthe old
man twisted his hands nervouslyIyoull excuse my saying so sirI
do hope youll be careful tonight sir I cant help being afraid that
somethingll happen to you Master Jim

Nonsense Jason Jimmie Dale laughed cheerfully Theres nothing
going to happento me You go ahead now and stay with the servants and
get them out of the road at the proper time

He bathed dressed ate his dinner and was slipping cartridges into the
magazine of his automatic when within a minute or two of eight oclock
Jasons whisper came from the doorway

Its all clear now Master Jim sir

Right Jimmie Dale respondedand followed Jason down the stairway
and to the head of the cellar stairs

Here Jason halted

God keep you Master Jim said the old man huskily Goodnight
Jason Jimmie Dale answered softly and with a reassuring squeeze on
the others arm went on down to the cellar

Here he moved quickly noiselessly across to the windownot the
window of the night before but another of the same description almost
directly beneath the one in his den above that faced the garage and lay
in the line of that black shadow path between the two buildings Deftly
cautiously without sound a half inch an inch at a time he opened it
He stood listening then A minute passed Then he heard Benson open and
shut the back door then Benson in the yard and then Bensons voice in
a muttered and irritable growl talking to himself as he stamped around
on the ground

With a lithe agile movement Jimmie Dale pulled himself up and through
the windowand began to creep rapidly on hands and knees toward
the garage It was dark intensely dark He could barely distinguish
Bensons form though as he passed the other the slight sounds he made
drowned out by the chauffeurs angry mumblings he could have reached
out and touched Benson easily

He gained the interior of the garage and as Benson came on again
stepped lightly into the car lifted the seat and wriggled his way
inside

It was close stuffy abominably cramped but Jimmie Dale was smiling
grimly now Thanks to Benson there wasnt a possibility that he had
been seen He both felt and heard Benson start the car Then the car
moved forward ran the length of the driveway bumped slightly as it
made the streetand stopped He heard Benson jump out and run backand
then he listened intently and the grim smile flickered on his lips
again Came the sound of a footstep on the sidewalk close beside the
carthen silencethe car shook a little as though some ones weight
was on the stepthen the footsteps recededBenson returned on the
runand the car started forward once more

Perhaps ten minutes passed Three times the car had swerved sharply
making a corner turn Then Jimmie Dale pushed up the seat and
protected from observation from behind by the back of the car itself
crawled out and crouched down on the floor of the tonneau

Dont look around Benson he said calmly Are we followed

Yes sir Benson answered At least theres always been a car behind
us though not the same one Theyre pretty clever There must be three
or four each following the other Every time I turn a corner its a
different car that turns it behind me

How far behind Jimmie Dale asked

Half a block

Slow down a little instructed Jimmie Dale and dont turn another
corner until theyve had a chance to accommodate themselves to your new
speed You are going too fast for me to jump and I dont want them to
notice any change in speed except what is made in plain sight Yes
thats better Where are we Benson

Thats Amsterdam Avenue ahead replied Benson

All right said Jimmie Dale quietly Turn into it The more people
the better Tell me just as you are about to turn

Yes sir said Benson then almost on the instant All ready sir

Jimmie Dales hand reached out for the door catch edged the door ajar
the car swerved took the cornerand Jimmie Dale stepped out on the
running board hung there negligently for a moment as though chatting
with Benson and then with an airy goodnight dropped nonchalantly
to the ground and the next instant had mingled with the throng of
pedestrians on the sidewalk

A half minute later a large gray automobile turned the corner and
followed Bensonand Jimmie Dale stepping out into the street again
swung on a downtown car The road to the Sanctuary was open

In his impatience now the street car seemed to drag along every foot
of the way but a glance at his watch as he finally reached the Bowery
and walking then rapidly approached the cross street a few steps ahead
that led to the Sanctuary told him that it was still but a quarter to
nine But even at that he quickened his steps a little He was free now
There was a sort of savage elemental uplift upon him He was free He
could strike now in his own defenseand hers In a few moments he would
be at the Sanctuary in a few more he would be Larry the Bat and by
tomorrow at the latest he would seeThe Tocsin After all that hour
was not to be taken from him It was not perhaps the hour that she had
meant it should be thought and prayed perhaps that it might be It
was not the hour of victory But it was the hour that meant to him the
realisation of the years of longing the hour when he should see her
see her for the first time face to face when there should be no more
barriers between them when

Fer Gawds sake mister buy a pencil

A hand was plucking at his sleeve the thin voice was whining in his
ear He halted mechanically A woman old bedraggled ragged was
thrusting a bunch of cheap pencils imploringly toward himand then
with a stifled cry Jimmie Dale leaned forward The eyes that lifted to
his for an instant were bright and clear with the vigor of youth great
eyes of brown they were and trouble hope fear wistfulness ay and
a glorious shyness were in their depths And then the voice he knew so
well the Tocsins was whispering hurriedly

I will be waiting here Jimmiefor Larry the Bat



CHAPTER VIII

THE TOCSIN


It was only a little way back along the street from the Sanctuary to
the corner on the Bowery where as Jimmie Dale he had left her where as
Larry the Bat now he was going to meet her again it would take only
a moment or so even at Larry the Bats habitual characteristic
slouching gaitbut it seemed that was all too slow that he must throw
discretion to the winds and run the distance His blood was tingling
there was elation upon him coupled with an almost childlike dread that
she might be gone

The Tocsin The Tocsin he kept saying to himself

Yes she was still there still whiningly imploring those who passed to
buy her miserable pencilsand then with a quickflung whisper to him
to follow as he slouched up close to her she had started slowly down
the street

The Tocsin The Tocsin The Tocsinhis brain seemed to be ringing
with the words ringing with them in a note clear as a silver bell
The Tocsinat last The woman who so strangely so wonderfully so
mysteriously had entered into his life and possessed it and filled it
with a love and yearning that had come to mold and sway and actuate
his very existencethe woman for whom he had fought for whom he had
risked and gladly risked his wealth his name his honoureverything
the woman for whose sake he the Gray Seal was sought and hounded as
the most notorious criminal of the age she whose cleverness whose
resourcefulness whose amazing intimacy with the hidden things of the
underworld had seemed indeed to border on the supernatural she the
Tocsinthe woman whose face he had never seen before The woman whose
face he had never seen beforeand who now was that wretched hag that
hobbled along the street before him begging whining and importuning
the passersby to purchase of her pitiful wares

He laughed a littlebuoyantly He had never pictured a first meeting
such as this A hag Yes And one as disreputable in appearance as he
himself as Larry the Bat was disreputable But he had seen her eyes
Inimitable as was her disguise she could not hide her eyes or hide the
pledge they held of the beauty of form and feature beneath the tattered
rags and the touch of a master in the makeup that brought haggard want
and age into the faceand dimly he began to divine the source the
means by which she had acquired the information that for years had
enabled her to plan their coups that had enabled him to execute them
under the guise of crime that for years had seemed beyond all human
reach

Where was she going Where was she taking him But what did it matter
The years of waiting were at an endthe years of mystery in a few
moments now would be mystery no more

Ah She had turned from the Bowery and was heading east He shuffled on
after her guardedly a half block behind It was well that Jimmie Dale
had disappeared that he was Larry the Bat againthe neighbourhood
was growing more and more one that Jimmie Dale could not long linger
in without attracting attention while on the other hand it was the
natural environment of such as Larry the Bat and such as she who was
leading him now to the supreme moment of his life Yes it was thatthe
fulfillment of the years The thought of it alone filled his mind his
soul it brushed aside it blotted out for the time being the danger
the peril the deadly menace that hung over them both It was only that
she the Tocsin was hereonly that at last they would be together

On she went traversing street after street the direction always
trending toward the riveruntil finally she halted before what appeared
to be as nearly as he could make out in the almost total darkness of
the illlighted street a small and tumbledown selfcontained dwelling
that bordered on what seemed to be an unfenced store yard of some
description He drew his breath in sharply She had haltedwaiting for
him to come up with her She was waiting for himWAITING for him
It seemed as though he drank of some strange exhilarating elixirhe
reached her side eagerlyand thenand thenher hand had caught his
and she was leading him into the house into a black passage where he
could see nothing into a room equally black over whose threshold he
stumbled and her voice in a low conscious way with a little tremour
a half sob in it that thrilled him with its promise was in his ears

We are safe here Jimmie for a little whilebut oh Jimmie what
have I done What have I done to bring you into thisonlyonlyI was
so sure so sure Jimmie that there was nothing more to fear

The blood was beating in hammer blows at his temples It seemed all
unreal untrue that this moment could be his that it was not a dreama
dream which was presently to be snatched from him in a bitter awakening
And then he laughed out wildly passionately Noit was true it was
real Her breath was on his cheek it was a living pulsing hand that
was still in hisand then soul and mind and body seemed engulfed and
lost in a mad ecstasyand she was in his arms crushed to him and he
was raining kisses upon her face

I love you I love you he was crying hoarsely and over and over
again I love you I love you

She did not struggle The warm rich lips were yielding to his he could
feel the throb the life in the young lithe form against his own She
was hishis The years the past all were swept awayand she was his
at lasthis for always And there came a mighty sense of kingship
upon him as though all the world were at his feet and virility and a
great glad strength above all other mens and a song was in his soul
a song triumphantfor she was his

You he cried outand strained her to him You he cried againand
kissed her lips and her eyelids and her lips again

And then her head was buried on his shoulder and she was crying softly
but after a moment she raised her hands and laid them upon his face
and held them there and because it was dark dared to raise her head as
well and her eyes to look into his

Then for a long time they stood there so and for a long time neither
spokeand then with a little startled broken cry as though the peril
and the menace hanging over them forgotten for the moment were thrust
like a knife stab suddenly upon her she drew herself away and ran from
him and went and got a lamp and lighted it and set it upon the table

And Jimmie Dale still standing there watched her How gloriously her
eyes shone dimmed and misty with the tears that filled them though they
were And there was nothing incongruous in the rags that clothed her in
the squalour and poverty of the bare room in the white furrows that the
tears had plowed through the grime and makeup on her cheeks

You wonderful wonderful woman Jimmie Dale whispered

She shook her head as though almost in selfreproach

I am not wonderful Jimmie she said in a low voice Iand then
she caught his arm and her voice broke a littleIve brought you into
thisprobably to your death Jimmie tell me what happened last night
and since then IIve thought at times today I should go mad Oh
Jimmie there is so much to say tonight so much to do ifif we
are ever to be together forfor always Last night Jimmiethe
telephoneI knew there was dangerthat all had gone wrongwhat was
it

His arms were around her shoulders drawing her close to him again

I found the wires tapped he said slowly

Yes andand the man you metthe chauffeur

He is dead Jimmie Dale answered gently

He felt her hand close with a quick spasmodic clutch upon his arm her
face grew whiteand for a moment she turned away her head

Andand the package she asked presently

I do not know replied Jimmie Dale He did not have it with him
he

Wait she interrupted quickly We are only wasting time like this
Tell me everything everything just as it happened everything from the
moment you received my letter

And holding her there in his arms softening as best he could the more
brutal details he told her And at the end for a little while she was
silent then in a strained impulsive way she asked again

The chauffeuryou are sureyou are positive that he is dead

Yes said Jimmie Dale grimly I am sure And then the pentup flood
of questions burst from his lips Who was the chauffeur The package
the box numbered 428 and John Johansson And the Crime Club And
the issue at stake The danger the peril that surrounded her And
sheabove allmore than anything elseabout herselfher strange
life its mystery

She checked him with a strangely wistful touch of her finger upon his
lips with a queer pathetic shake of her head

No Jimmie not that way You would never understand I cannot

But I am to knownow Surely I am to know NOW he cried a sudden
sense of dismay upon him Three years Three yearsand always the
next time I must know now if I am to help you

She smiled a little wanly at him as she drew herself away and
dropping into a chair placed her elbows on the rickety table cupping
her chin in her hands

Yes you are to know now she said almost as though she were talking
to herself then with a swift intake of her breath impulsively
Jimmie Jimmie I had thought that it would be all so different
whenwhen you came Thatthat I would have nothing to fearfor
youfor mebecauseit would be all over And now you are here
Jimmieand oh thank God for youbut I feel tonight almostalmost
as though it were hopeless thatthat we were beaten

Beaten He stepped quickly to the table and sat down and took one
of her hands away from her face to hold it in both his own Beaten
he laughed out defiantly then playfully soothingly to reassure her
Jimmie Dale and Larry the Bat and the Gray Seal and the TocsinBEATEN
And after we have just scored the last trick

But we do not hold many trumps Jimmie she answered gravely You
have seen something of this Crime Clubs power its methods its
merciless cruel inhuman cunning and you perhaps think that you
understandbut you have not begun to grasp the extent of either that
power or cunning This horrible organisation has been in existence for
many years I do not know how many I only know that the men of whom
it is composed are not ordinary criminals that they do not work in
the ordinary waytoday they set the machinery of fraud deception
robbery and murder in motion that ten years from now and perhaps
only then will culminate in the final success of their schemesand
they play only for enormous stakes Buther lips grew setyou will
see for yourself I must not talk any longer than is necessary we must
not take too much time You count on three days before they begin to
suspect that all is not right with Jimmie DaleI know them better than
you and I give you two days fortyeight hours at the outside and
possibly far less Jimmieabruptlydid you ever hear of Peter
LaSalle

The capitalist Yes said Jimmie Dale He died a few years ago I
know his brother Henry wellat the club and all that

Do you she said evenly Well the man you know is not Peter
LaSalles brother he is an impostorand one of the Crime Club

NotPeter LaSalles brotherJimmie Dale repeated the words
mechanically And suddenly his brain was whirling Vaguely dimly in
little memory snatches events not pertinent then vitally significant
now came crowding upon him Peter LaSalle had come from somewhere in
the West to live in New York and very shortly afterward had died The
estate had been worth something over eleven millions And there had
beenhe leaned quickly tensely forward over the table staring at her
My God he whispered hoarsely You are not you cannot bethethe
daughterPeter LaSalles daughter who disappeared strangely

Yes she said quietly I am Marie LaSalle



CHAPTER IX

THE TOCSINS STORY


LaSalle The old French name That old French inscription on the ring
SONNEZ LE TOCSIN Yes he began to understand now She was Marie
LaSalle He began to remember more clearly

Marie LaSalle They had said she was one of the most beautiful girls
who had ever made her entree into New York society But he had never met
heras Marie LaSalle never met heruntil now as the Tocsin in this
bare destitute squalid hovel here at bay both of them for their
lives

He had been away when she had come with her father to New York and
on his return there had only been the fathers brother in the fathers
placeand she was gone He remembered the furor her disappearance had
caused the enormous rewards her uncle had offered in an effort to trace
her the thousand and one speculations as to what had become of her
and that then gradually as even the most startling and mystifying of
events and happenings always do the affair had dropped into oblivion
and had been forgotten by the public at least He began to count back
Yes it must have been nearly five years ago two years before she
as the Tocsin and he as the Gray Seal had formed their amazing and
singular partnership thathe started suddenly as she spoke

I want to tell you in as few words as I can she said abruptly
breaking the silence Listen then Jimmie My mother died ten years
ago I was little more than a child then Shortly after her death
father made a business trip to New York and on the advice of some
supposed friends he had a new will drawn up by a lawyer whom they
recommended and to whom they introduced him I do not know who those
men were The lawyers name was Travers Hilton Travers She glanced
curiously at Jimmie Dale and added quickly He was the chauffeurthe
man who was killed last night

You mean Jimmie Dale burst out you mean that he wasbut first
the will What was in the will

It was a very simple will she answered And from the nature of it
it was not at all strange that my father should have been willing to
have had it drawn by a comparative stranger if that is what you are
thinking Summarised in a few words the will left everything to me
and appointed my Uncle Henry as my guardian and the sole executor of the
estate until I should have reached my twentyfifth birthday It provided
for a certain sum each year to be paid to my uncle for his services as
executor and at the expiration of the trust periodthat is when I was
twentyfivebequeathed to him the sum of one hundred thousand dollars

Jimmie Dale nodded Go on he prompted

It is hard to tell it in logical sequence she said hesitating a
moment So many things seem to overlap each other You must understand
a little more about Hilton Travers During the five years following the
signing of the will father came frequently to New York and became
not only intimate with Travers but so much impressed with the others
cleverness and ability that he kept putting more and more of his
business into Travers hands At the end of that five years we moved
to New York and father who was then quite an old man retired from all
active business and turned over a great many of his personal affairs
to Travers to look after for him giving Travers power of attorney in a
number of instances So much for Travers Now about my uncle He was my
fathers only brother in fact they were the only surviving members of
their family apart from very distant connections in France from where
generations back the family originally came Her hand touched
Jimmie Dales for an instant That ring Jimmie with its crest and
inscription is the old family coat of arms

Yes he said briefly I surmised as much

Strange as it may seem in view of the fact that they had not seen each
other for twenty years she went on hurriedly my father and my
uncle were more than ordinarily attached to each other Letters passed
regularly between them and there was constant talk of one paying the
other a visitbut the visit never materialised My uncle was somewhere
in Australia my father was here and consequently I never saw my uncle
He was quite a different type of man from fathermore restless less
settled more rough and ready preferring the outdoor life of the
Australian bush to the restrictions of any socalled civilisation I
imagine Financially I do not think he ever succeeded very well for
twice in one way or another he lost every sheep on his ranch and
father set him up again and I do not think he could ever have had much
of a ranch for I remember once in one of the letters he wrote that he
said he had not seen a white man in weeks so he must have lived a very
lonely life Indeed at about the time father drew the new will my
uncle wrote saying that he had decided to give up sheep running on his
own account as it did not pay and to accept a very favourable offer
that had been made to him to manage a ranch in New Zealand and his next
letter was from the latter country stating that he had carried out
his intentions and was well satisfied with the change he had made The
longproposed visit still continued to occupy my fathers thoughts and
on his retirement from business he definitely made up his mind to go
out to New Zealand taking me with him In fact the plans were all
arranged my uncle expressed unbounded delight in his letters and we
were practically on the eve of sailing when a cable came from my uncle
telling us to postpone the visit for a few months as he was obliged to
make a buying trip for his new employer that would keep him away that
length of timeand thenher fingers that had been abstractedly
picking out the lines formed by the grain of the wood in the table top
closed suddenly into tightclenched fistsand thenmy father died

Jimmie Dale turned away his head There were tears in her eyes The old
sense of unreality was strong upon him again He was listening to the
Tocsins story It was strange that he should be doing thatthat
it could be really so It seemed as though magically he had been
transported out of the world where for years past he had lived with
danger lurking at every turn where men set watch about his house to
trap him where the denizens of the underworld yowled like starving
beasts to sink their fangs in him where the police were ceaselessly
upon his trail to wreak an insensate vengeance upon him it seemed as
though he had been transported away from all that to something that he
had dreamed might perhaps sometime happen that he had hoped might
happen that he had longed for always but now that it was his that it
also was full of the sense of the unreal And yet as his mind followed
the thread of her story and leaped ahead and vaguely glimpsed what was
to come he was conscious in a sort of premonitory way of a vaster peril
than any he had ever known as though forces for the moment masked
were arrayed against him whose strength and whose malignity were beyond
human parallel In what a strange almost incoherent way his brain was
working He roused himself a little and looked around himand with a
shock the starkness of the room the abject pitiful air of destitution
brought home to him with terrific startling force the significance of
the scene in which he was playing a part His face set suddenly in
hard lines That she should have been brought to assume such a life as
thisforced out of her environment of wealth and refinement forced
in her purity to rub shoulders with the vile the dissolute forced to
exist as such a creature amid the crime and vice the wretched horror
of the underworld that swirled around her There was anger now upon him
burning hota merciless craving that was a savage hungry lust for
vengeance

And then she was speaking again

Fathers death occurred very shortly after my uncles message advising
us to postpone our trip was received On his death Travers very
naturally as fathers lawyer cabled my uncle to come to New York
at once and my uncle replied saying that he was coming by the first
steamer

She paused againbut only for an instant as though to frame her
thoughts in words

I have told you that I had never seen my uncle that even my father had
not seen him for twenty years and I have told you that the man you know
as Henry LaSalle is an impostorI am using the word uncle now when I
refer to him simply to avoid confusion You are perhaps expecting
me to say that I took a distinctive dislike to him from the moment he
arrived On the contrary I had every reason to be predisposed toward
him and indeed was rather agreeably surprised than otherwisehe was
not nearly so uncouth and unpolished as somehow I had pictured his
life would have made him Do you understand Jimmie He was kind
sympathetic and in an apathetic way I liked him I say apathetic
because I think that best describes my own attitude toward every one and
everything following fathers death untilTHAT NIGHT

She rose abruptly from her chair as though a passive position of any
kind had suddenly become intolerable

Why tell you what my father and I were to each other she cried out
in a low passionate voice It seemed as though everything that meant
anything had gone out of my life I became worn out nervous and though
the days were bad enough the nights were a source of dread I began
to suffer from insomniaI could not sleep This was even before my
supposed uncle came I used to read for hours and hours in my room
after I had gone to bed Butshe flung out her hand with an impatient
gesturethere is no need to dwell on that One night about a week
after that man had arrived and a little over a month after father had
died I was in my room and had finished a book I was reading I remember
that it was well after midnight I had not the slightest inclination
to sleep I picked up another bookand after that another There were
plenty in my room but irrationally of course none pleased me I
decided to go down to the librarynot that I think I really expected
to find anything that I actually wanted but more because it was an
impulse and furnished me for the moment with some definite objective
something to do I got up slipped on a dressing gown and went
downstairs The lights were all out I was just on the point of
switching on those in the reception hall when suddenly it seemed as
though I had not strength to lift my hand and I remember that for an
instant I grew terribly cold with dread and fear From the room on my
right a voice had reached me The door was closed but the voice was
raised in an outburst of profanity II could hear every word

If shes out of the way theres no comeback the voice snarled I
wont listen to anything else Do you hear Why you fool what are you
trying to dohand me one Turn everything into cash and divvy and
beat iteh And Im the goat and I get caught and get twenty years
for stealing trust fundsand the rest of you get the coin He swore
terribly again Whos taken the risk in this for the last five years
Therell be no smart Aleck lawyer trickstherell be no halfway
measures And who are you to dictate She goes outthats safeI
inherit as next of kin with no one to dispute it and thats all there
is to it

I stood there and could not move It was the voice of the man I knew
as my uncle My heart seemed to have stopped beating I tried to tell
myself that I was dreaming that it was too horrible too incredible to
be real that they could not really mean toto MURDER me And then I
recognised Hilton Travers voice

I am not dictating and you are not serious of course he said
with what seemed an uneasy laugh I am only warning you that you are
forgetting to take the real Henry LaSalle into account He is bound to
hear of this eventually and then

Another voice broke inone I did not recognise

Youre talking too loud both of you Travers doesnt understand but
hes to be wised up tonight according to orders and

The voice became inaudible muffledI could not hear any more I
suppose I remained there another three or four minutes too stunned to
know what to do and then I ran softly along the hall to the library
door The library you understand was at the rear of the room they
were in and the two rooms were really one that is there was only an
archway between them I cannot tell you what my emotions wereI do not
know I only know that I kept repeating to myself they are going to
kill me they are going to kill me and that it seemed I must try and
find out everything everything I could

She turned away from the table and began to pace nervously up and down
the miserable room

Jimmie Dale rose impulsively from his chairbut she waved him back
again

No wait she said Let me finish I crept into the library It took
me a long time because I had to be so careful not to make the slightest
noise I suppose it was fully six or seven minutes from the time I
had first heard my supposed uncles voice until I had crept far enough
forward to be able to see into the room beyond There were three men
there The man I knew as my uncle was sitting at one end of the
table another had his back toward me and Travers was facing in my
directionand I think I never saw so ghastly a face as was Hilton
Travers then He was standing up sort of swaying as he leaned with
both hands on the table

Now then Travers the man whose back was turned to me was saying
threateningly youve got the story nowsign those papers

It seemed as though Travers could not speak for a moment He kept
looking wildly from one to the other He was white to the lips

Youve let me in forTHIS he said hoarsely at last You
devilsyou devilsyou devils Youve let me in formurder Both of
them Both Peter and his brotherMURDERED

She stopped abruptly before Jimmie Dale and clutched his arm tightly

Jimmie I dont know why I did not scream out Everything went black
for a moment before my eyes It was the first suspicion I had had that
my father had met with foul play and I

But now Jimmie Dale swayed up from his chair

Murdered he exclaimed tensely Your father Butbut I remember
perfectly there was no hint of any such thing at the time and never
has been since He died from quite natural causes

She looked at him strangely

He died frominoculation she said Diddid you not see something
of that laboratory in the Crime Club yourself the night before
lastenough to understand

Good God muttered Jimmie Dale in a startled way then Go on Go on
What happened then

She passed her hand a little wearily across her eyesand sank down into
her chair again

Travers she continued picking up the thread of her story had
raised his voice and the third man at the table leaned suddenly
aggressively toward him

Hold your tongue he growled furiously All youre asked to do is
sign the papersnot talk

Travers shook his head

I wont he cried out I wont have any hand in another murderin
hers My God I wontI wont I tell you Its horrible

Look here you fool the man who was posing as my uncle broke in
then Youre in this too deep to get out now If you know whats good
for you youll do as youre told

Jimmie I shall never forget Travers face It seemed to have changed
from white to gray and there was horror in his eyes and then he
seemed to lose all control of himself shaking his fists in their faces
cursing them in utter abandon

Im bad he cried Ive gone everything everything but the
limiteverything but murder I stop there Ill have no more to do
with this Im through Youyou pulled me into this andand I didnt
know

Well you know now the third man sneered What are you going to do
about it

Im going to see that no harm comes to Marie LaSalle Travers
answered in a dull way

The other man now was on his feetand I do not know quite how to
express it Jimmie he seemed ominously quiet in both his voice and his
movements

Youd better think that over again Travers he said Do you mean
it

I mean it Travers said I mean itGod help me

You may well add that returned the other with an ugly laugh He
reached out his hand toward the telephone on the table Do you know
what will happen to you if I telephone a certain number and say that you
have turnedtraitor

Ill have to take my chances Travers replied doggedly Im
through

Take them then flung out the other Youll have little time given
you to do us any harm

Travers did not answer I think he almost expected an attack upon him
then from the two men He hesitated a moment then backed slowly toward
the door What happened in the next few moments in that room I do not
know I stole out of the library I was obsessed with the thought that
I must see Travers see him at all costs before he got away from the
house I reached the end of the hall as the room door opened and he
came out It was dark as I said and I could not see distinctly but
I could make out his form He closed the door behind himand then
I called his name in a whisper He took a quick step toward me then
turned and hurried toward the front door and I thought he was going
awaybut the next instant I understood his ruse He opened the front
door shut it again quite loudly and crept back to me

Take me somewhere where we will be safequick he whispered

There was only one place where I was sure we would be safe I led
him to the rear of the house and up the servants stairs and to my
boudoir

She broke off abruptly and once more rose from her chair and once
more began to pace the room Back in his chair Jimmie Dale tense and
motionless now watched her without a word

It would take too long to tell you all that passed between us she
went on hurriedly The man was frankly a criminalbut not to the
extent of murder And in that respect at least he was honest with
himself Almost the first words he said to me were Miss LaSalle I am
as good as a dead man if I am caught by the devils behind those two men
downstairs And then he began to plead with me to make my own escape
He did not know who the man was that was posing as my uncle had never
seen him before until he presented himself as Henry LaSalle the other
man he knew as Clarke but knew also that Clarke was merely an assumed
name He had fallen in with Clarke almost from the time that he had
begun to practise his profession and at Clarkes instigation had gone
from one crooked deal to another and had made a great deal of money He
knew that behind Clarke was a powerful daring and unscrupulous band of
criminals organised on a gigantic scale of which he himself was in
a sensea probationary sense as he put ita member but he had never
come into direct contact with themhe had received all his orders and
instructions through Clarke He had been told by Clarke that he was to
cultivate father following the introduction to win fathers confidence
to get as many of fathers affairs into his hands as possible to reach
the position in fact of becoming fathers recognised attorneyand
all this with the object as he supposed of embezzling from father on
a large scale Then father died and Travers was instructed to cable my
uncle He knew that the man who answered that summons was an impostor
but he did not know until they had admitted it to him that night that
both my father and my uncle had been murdered and that I too was to
be made away with

She looked at Jimmie Dale and suddenly laughed out bitterly

No you dont understand even yet the patient ingenious deviltry
of those fiends It was they at the time the new will was drawn who
offered to buy out my real uncles sheep ranch in that lonely unsettled
district in Australia and offered him that new position in New Zealand
My uncle never reached New Zealand He was murdered on his way there
And in his place assuming his name appeared the man who has been
posing as my uncle ever since Do you begin to see For five years
they were patiently working out their plans for five years before
my fathers death that man lived and became known and accepted and
ESTABLISHED himself as Henry LaSalle Do you see now why he cabled us to
postpone our visit He ran very little risk The chances were one in a
thousand that any of his few acquaintances in Australia would ever run
across him in New Zealand and besides he was chosen because it
seems there was a slight resemblance between him and the real Henry
LaSalleenough with his changed mode of living and more elaborate and
pretentious surroundings to have enabled him to carry through a bluff
had it become necessary He had all of my uncles papers and the Crime
Club furnished him with every detail of our lives here I forgot to
say too that from the moment my uncle was supposed to have reached New
Zealand all his letters were typewrittenan evidence in fathers eyes
that his brother had secured a position of some importance as indeed
from apparently unprejudiced sources they took pains to assure father
was a fact This left them with only my uncles signature to forge to
the lettersnot a difficult matter for them

Believing that they had Travers so deeply implicated that he could do
nothing even if he had the inclination which they had not for a moment
imagined and arrogant in the belief in their own power to put him out
of the way in any case if he proved refractory they admitted all this
to him that night when he brought up the issue of the real Henry LaSalle
putting in an appearance sooner or later and when they wanted him to
smooth their path by releasing all documents where his power of attorney
was involved Do you see now the part they gave Travers to play It was
to put the stamp of genuineness upon the false Henry LaSalle Not but
that they were prepared with what would appear to be overwhelmingly
convincing evidence to prove it if it were necessary but if the man
were accepted by the estates lawyer there was little chance of any one
else questioning his identity

She halted again by the tableand forced a smile as her eyes met
Jimmie Dales

I am almost through Jimmie That night was a terrible one for both
of us Travers life was not worth a moments purchase once they found
himand mine was only under reprieve until sufficient time to obviate
suspicion should have elapsed after fathers death We had no proof that
would stand in any courteven if we should have been given the chance
to adopt that course And without absolute irrefutable proof it was
all so cleverly woven stretched over so many years that our charge
must have been held to be too visionary and fantastic to have any basis
in fact

All Travers would have been able to advance was the statement that the
supposed Henry LaSalle had admitted being an impostor and a murderer
to him Who would believe it On the face of it it appeared to be an
absurdity And even granted that we were given an opportunity to bring
the charge they would be able to prove by a hundred influential
and wellknown men in New Zealand that the impostor was really Henry
LaSalle and were we able to find any of my uncles old acquaintances in
Australia it would be necessary to get them hereand not one of them
would have reached America alive

But there was not a chance not a chance Jimmie of doing thatthey
would have killed Travers the moment he showed himself in the open The
only thing we could do that night was to try and save our own lives the
only thing we could look forward to was acquiring in some way unknown
to them the proof fully established with which we could crush them in
a single stroke and before they would have time to strike back

The vital thing was proof of my uncles death That if it could
be obtained at all could only be obtained in Australia Travers was
obliged to go somewhere to disappear from that moment if he wanted to
save his life and he volunteered to go out there He left the house
that night by the back entrance in an old servants suit which I found
for himand I never heard from him again until a month ago in the
personal column of the MORNING NEWSARGUS through which we had agreed
to communicate

As for myself I left the house the next morning telling my pseudo
uncle that I was going to spend a few days with a friend And this
I actually did but in those few days I managed to turn all my own
securities that had been left me by my mother and which amounted to a
considerable sum into cash And then Jimmie I came tothis I have
lived like this and in different disguises as a settlement worker as a
widow of means in a fashionable uptown apartment but mostly as you see
me nowfor five years For five years I have watched my supposed
uncle hoping praying that through him I could get to know the others
associated with him hoping praying that Travers would succeed hoping
praying that we would get them alland watching day after day and year
after year the personal column of the paper until at last I began
to be afraid that it was all useless And there was nothing Jimmie
nothing anywhere and I had no successher voice choked a little
Nothing Even Clarke never went again to the house You can understand
now how I came to know the strange things that I wrote to the Gray Seal
how the life that I have led how this life here in the underworld how
the constant search for some clew on my own account brought them to my
knowledge and you can understand now too why I never dared to let
you meet me for I knew well enough that while I worked to undermine my
fathers and my uncles murderers they were moving heaven and earth to
find me

That is all Jimmie The day before yesterday a month after Travers
first message to let me know that he was coming there was another
personal giving me an hour and a telephone number He was back He
had everythingeverything We dared not meet he was afraid suspicious
that they had got track of him again You know the rest That package
contained the proof that with Travers death can probably never be
obtained again Do you understand why THEY want itwhy it is life
and death to me Do you understand why my supposed uncle offered huge
rewards for me why secretly every resource of that hideous organisation
has been employed to find methat it is only by my DEATH the estate can
pass into their hands and now

She flung out her hands suddenly toward Jimmie Dale Oh Jimmie
Jimmie IveIve fought so long alone Jimmie what are we to do

He came slowly to his feet She had fought so longalone But nownow
it was his turn to fightfor her But how She had not told him
allsurely she had not told him all for everything depended upon that
package There had been so much to tell that she had not thought of all
and she had not told him the details about that

That boxNo 428 he cried quickly What is that What does it
mean

She shook her head

I do not know she answered

Then who is this John Johansson

I do not know she said again

Nor where the Crime Club is

Nodully

He stared at her for a moment in a dazed way

My God Jimmie Dale murmured

And then she turned away her head

Itsits pretty bad isnt it Jimmie II told you that we did not
hold many trumps



CHAPTER X

SILVER MAG


There was silence between them Minute after minute passed Neither
spoke

Jimmie Dale dropped back into his chair again and stared abstractedly
before him We do not hold many trumps Jimmiewe do not hold many
trumpsher words were repeating themselves over and over in his mind
They seemed to challenge him mockingly to deny what was so obviously a
fact and because he could not deny it to taunt and jeer at himto jeer
at him when all that was held at stake hung literally upon his next
move

He looked up mechanically as the Tocsin walked to a broken mirror at the
rear of the miserable room nodded mechanically in approval as she began
deftly to retouch the makeup on her face where the tears had left their
tracesand resumed his abstracted gaze before him

Box number fourtwoeightJohn Johanssonthe Crime Clubthe identity
of the man who was posing as Henry LaSalle If only he could hit upon a
clew to the solution of a single one of those things or a single phase
of one of themif only he could glimpse a ray of light that would at
least prompt action when every moment of inaction was multiplying the
odds against them

There were the men who were watching his house at that moment on
Riverside Drivehe as Larry the Bat might in turn keep watch on them
He had though of that In time perhaps he might by so doing discover
the whereabouts of the Crime Club In time It was just thathe had no
time Fortyeight hours the Tocsin insisted was all the time that he
could count upon before they would become suspicious of Jimmie Dales
illness before they would discover that they were watching an empty
house

He mightthough this was even more hazardousmake an attempt to trace
the wires that tapped those of his telephone through the basement window
that gave on the garage driveway And what then True they could not
lead very far away but even if successful what then They would not
lead him to the Crime Club but simply to some confederate to some man
or woman playing the part of a servant perhaps in the house next door
who in turn would have to be shadowed and watched

Jimmie Dale shook his head Better of the two to start in at once and
shadow those who were shadowing his house But that was not the way He
knew that intuitively He hated to eliminate it from consideration
for he had no other move to take its placebut such a move was almost
suicide in itself Time and time alone was the vital factor They the
Tocsin and he must act quicklyand STRIKE that night if they were to
win His fingers the grimy fingers dirtynailed of Larry the
Bat that none now would recognise as the slim tapering wonderfully
sensitive fingers of Jimmie Dale the fingers that had made the name of
the Gray Seal famous whose tips mocked at bars and safes and locks
and seemed to embody in themselves all the human senses tightened
spasmodically on the edge of the table Time Time Time It seemed to
din in his ears And while he sat there powerless impotent the
Crime Club was moving heaven and earth to find what HE must findthat
packageif he was to save this woman here the woman whom he loved she
who had been forced through the machinations of these hell fiends
to adopt the life of a wretched hag to exist among the dregs of the
underworld whose squalour and vice and wantonness none knew better than
he

Jimmie Dales face set grimly Somewheresomewhere in the past five
years of this life of hers in which she had been fighting the Crime
Club pitting that clever brain of hers against it MUST lie a clew
She had told him her story only in baldest outline with scarcely a
reference to her own personal acts with barely a single detail There
must be something something that perhaps she had overlooked something
just the merest hint of something that would supply a starting point
give him a glimmer of light

She came back from across the room and sank down in her chair again
She did not speakthe question that meant life and death to them both
was in her eyes

Jimmie answered the mute interrogation tersely

Not yet he said Then almost curtly in a quick incisive way as
the keen alert brain began to delve and probe You say this man Clarke
never returned to the house after that night

She nodded her head quietly

You are sure of that he insisted

Yes she said I am sure

And you say that all these years you have kept a watch on the man who
is posing as your uncle and that he never went anywhere or associated
with any one that would afford you a clew to this Crime Club

Yes she said again

It was a moment before Jimmie Dale spoke

Its very strange he said musingly at last So strange in fact
that its impossible He must have communicated with the others and
communicated with them often The game they were playing was too
big too full of details to admit of any other possibility And the
telephone as an explanation isnt good enough

And yet she said earnestly possible or impossible it is
nevertheless true That he might have succeeded in eluding me on
occasions was perhaps to be expected but that in all those years I
should not catch him once in what if you are correct must have been
many and repeated conferences with the same men is too improbable to be
thought of seriously

Jimmie Dale shook his head again

If you had been able to watch him night and day that might be so
he said crisply But at best you could only watch him a very small
portion of the time

She smiled at him a little wanly

Do you think Jimmie from what you as the Gray Seal know of me that
I would have watched in any haphazard way like that

He glanced at her with a sudden start

What do you mean he asked quickly

Look at me she said quietly Have you ever seen me before I mean as
I am now

No he answered after an instant Not that I know of

And yetshe smiled wanly againyou have not lived or made the
place you hold in the underworld without having heard of Silver Mag

You exclaimed Jimmie Dale YouSilver Mag He stared at her
wonderingly as crouchshouldered now the hair graythreaded
straggling out from under the hood of a faded darkblue seamworn
cloak she sat before him a typical creature of the underworld her
role an art in its conception perfect in its execution Silver Mag
Yes he had heard of Silver Magas every one in the Bad Lands had heard
of her Silver Mag and her pocketful of coin Always a pocketful of
silver so they said that was dispensed prodigally to the wives
and children temporarily deprived of support by husbands and fathers
unfortunate enough in their clashes with the law to be doing spaces
up the riverand therefore the underworld swore by Silver Mag
Always silver never a bill Silver Mag had never been seen with a
banknotethat was her eccentricity Much or little she gave or paid
out of her pocketful of jangling silver She was credited with being
a sworn enemy of the police andyes he remembered toowith having
done time herself I dont quite understand he said in a puzzled
way I havent run across you personally because you probably took
care to see that I shouldnt butits no secretevery one says youve
served a jail sentence yourself

That is simply enough explained she answered gravely The story is
of my own making When I decided to adopt this life both for my own
safety and as the best means of keeping a watch on that man I knew that
I must win the confidence of the underworld that I must have help and
that in order to obtain that help I must have some excuse for my enmity
against the man known as Henry LaSalle To be widely known in the
underworld was of inestimable valuenothing I knew could accomplish
that as quickly as eccentricity You see now how and why I became
known as Silver Mag I gained the confidence of every crook in New
York through their wives and children I told them the story of my jail
sentencewhile I swore vengeance on Henry LaSalle I told them that he
had had me arrested for something I never stole while I was working for
him as a charwoman and that he had had me railroaded to jail There
wasnt one but gave me credit for the theft perhaps but equally
there wasnt one but understood and my eccentricity helped this out
my wanting to get Henry LaSalle Welldo you see now Jimmie I had
money I had the confidence of the underworld I had an excuse for my
hatred of Henry LaSalle and so I had all the help I wanted Day and
night that man has been watched He receives no visitorswhat social
life he has is as you know at the club There is not a house that he
has ever entered that sooner or later I have not entered after him
in the hope of finding the headquarters of the clique Even the men
and women as far as human possibility could accomplish it that he
has talked to on the streets have been shadowed and their identity
satisfactorily establishedand the net result has been failure utter
absolute complete failure

Jimmie Dales eyes that had held steadily on her face shifted
troubled and perplexed to the table top

You are wonderful he said under his breath Wonderful Andand
that makes it all the more amazing all the more incomprehensible It is
still impossible that he has not been in close and constant touch with
his accomplices He MUST have been We would be blind fools to argue
against it It could not on the face of it have been otherwise

Then how when where has he done it she asked wearily

God knows he said bitterly And if they have been clever enough to
escape you all these years Im almost inclined to say what you said a
little while agothat were beaten

She watched him miserably as he pushed back his chair impulsively and
standing up stared down at her

Were against itHARD he said with a mirthless laugh Then his
lips tightening But well try another tackthe chauffeurTravers
Though even here the Crime Club has a days start of us even if last
night they knew no more about the whereabouts of that package than we
know now Im afraid of it The chances are more than even that theyve
already got it If they were able to catch Travers as the chauffeur
they would have had something tangible to work back fromJimmie Dale
was talking more to himself than to the Tocsin now as though he were
muttering his thoughts aloud How did they get track of him When
Where What has it led to And what in Heavens name he burst out
suddenly is this box number fourtwoeight

A safetydeposit vault perhaps that he has taken somewhere she
hazarded

Jimmie Dale laughed mirthlessly again

That is the one definite thing I do knowthat it isnt he said
positively It is nothing of that kind It was halfpast ten oclock
at night when I met him and he said that he had intended going back for
the package if it had been safe to do so Deposit vaults are not open
at that hour The package is or was if they have not already got it
readily accessibleand at any hour Now go over everything again every
detail that passed between you and Travers He let you know that he was
back in New York by means of a personal you said What else was in
that personal besides the telephone number and the hour you were to
call him Anything

Nothing that will help us any she replied colourlessly There were
simply the words northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and Waverly Place
and the signature that we had agreed upon the two first and two last
letters of the alphabet transposedBAZY

I see said Jimmie Dale quickly And over the phone he completed his
message Clever enough

Yes she said In that way if any one were listening or overhead
the plan there could be little harm come of it for the essential
feature of all the place of rendezvous was not mentioned It has not
been Travers fault that this happenedand in spite of every precaution
it has cost him his life He wanted nothing to give them a clew to my
whereabouts he was trying to guard against the slightest evidence that
would associate us one with the other He even warned me over the
phone not to tell him how where or the mode of life I was living And
naturally he dared give me no particulars about himself I was simply
to select a third party whom I could trust and to follow out his
instructions which were those that I sent to you in my letter

Jimmie Dale began to pace nervously up and down the room

Nothing else he queried a little blankly

Nothing else she said monotonously

But since last night since you knew that things had gone wrong he
persisted surely you traced that telephone numberthe one you called
up

Yes she said and shrugged her shoulders in a tired way Naturally
I did thatbut like everything else it amounted to nothing He
telephoned from Makoffs pawnshop on that alley off Thompson Street
and

WHERE Jimmie Dale suddenly stockstill almost shouted the word He
telephoned fromwhere Say that again

She looked at him in amazement half rising from her chair

Jimmie what is it she cried You dont mean that

He was beside her now his hands pressed upon her shoulders his face
flushed

Box number fourtwoeight He laughed out hysterically in his
excitement John Johanssonbox number fourtwoeight And like a fool
I never thought of it Dont you see Dont you know now yourself THE
UNDERGROUND POST OFFICE

She stood up clinging to him a wild relief that was based on her
confidence in him in her eyes and face even while she shook her head

No she said frantically NoI do not know Tell me Jimmie Tell me
quickly You mean at Makoffs

No Not Makoffsat Spider Jacks on Thompson Streethe was
clipping off his words still holding her tightly by the shoulders
still staring into her eyes You know Spider Jack Jacks little
novelty store Ah you have not learned all of the underworld yet
Spider Jack is the craftiest fence in the Bad Landsand Makoff is
his partner Spider buys the crooks stuff and Makoff disposes of it
through the pawnshopits only a step through the connecting back yard
from one to the other and

Yesbut she interrupted feverishly the packageyou said

Wait Jimmie Dale cried Im coming to that If Travers stood in with
Makoff he stood in with Spider Jack For years Spider has been a sort
of clearing house for the underworldfor years he has conducted and
profitably too his underground post office Crooks from all over
the country let alone those in New York communicate with each other
through Spider Jack These for a fee are registered at Spiders and
given a numbera box number he calls it though of course there
are no actual boxes Letters come by mail addressed to himthe sealed
envelope within containing the actually intended recipients name These
Spider either forwards or delivers in person when they are called
for Dozens of crooks too unwilling perhaps to dispose of small
illgotten articles at ruinous fence prices and finding it unhealthy
for the moment to keep them in their possession use this means of
depositing them temporarily for safekeeping You see now dont you
Its certain thats where Travers left the package He used the name
of John Johansson not to hoodwink Spider Jack I should say but as
an added safeguard against the Crime Club Travers must have known both
Makoff and Spider Jack in the old days and probably had reason and
good reason to trust them bothpossibly a crook then himself as
he confessed he may have acted in a legal capacity for them in their
frequent tangles with the police

Then she saidand there was a glad new note in her voice then
JimmieJimmie we are safe You can get it Jimmie It is only a little
thing for the Gray Seal to doto get it now that we know where it is

Yes he said tersely Yesif it is still there

Still thereshe repeated the words quickly nervously Still there
What do you mean

I mean if they too have not discovered that he was at Makoffsif
they have not got there first he said grimly There seems to be no
limit to their cleverness or their power They penetrated his disguise
as a chauffeur and who knows what more they have learned since last
night We are fighting them in the dark andWHATS THAT he whispered
tensely suddenlyand leaning forward like a flash as he whipped his
automatic from his pocket he blew out the lamp

The room was in darkness They stood there rigid silent listening Her
hand found and caught his arm

And then it came againa low sound the sound of a stealthy footstep
just outside the window that faced on the storage yard



CHAPTER XI

THE MAGPIE


A minute passedanother The automatic at Jimmie Dales hip the muzzle
just peeping over the table top held a steady bead on the window Came
the footstep againand then suddenly a series of low quick tappings
upon the windowpane The Tocsins hand slipped away from his arm
Jimmie Dales set face relaxed as he read the underground Morse and he
replaced his revolver slowly in his pocket

The Magpie said Jimmie Dale in an undertone Whats he want

I dont know she answered in a whisper He never came here before
Theres a back way out Jimmie if you

No he said quickly Weve enemies enough with out making one of
the Magpie He knows some one is here with youour shadows were on the
blind Dont queer yourself Let him in Ill light the lamp

He struck a match as she ran from the room and lifting the hot lamp
chimney with the edge of his ragged coat lighted the lamp He turned
the wick down a little shading and dimming the roomand then as he
flirted a bead of moisture from his forehead whimsically stretched out
his hand to watch it in the lamplight

Thats bad Jimmie he muttered gravely to himself as he noted an
almost imperceptible tremour Got a start didnt you Under a bit of a
strain eh Wellgrimlynever mind It looks as though the luck had
turned Makoff and Spider Jack

His hand reached up to his hat jerked the brim at a rakish angle over
his eyesand he sprawled himself out on a chair He heard the Tocsins
voice at the front door and a mans voice low and guarded answer her
Then the door closed and their steps approached the room It was rather
curious thata visit from the Magpie What could the Magpie want What
could there be in common between the Magpie and Silver Mag The Magpie
alias Slimmy Joe was counted the cleverest safe worker in the United
States barring only and always onea smile flickered across the lips
of Larry the Batone whose preeminence the Magpie much to his own
chagrin admitted himselfthe Gray Seal

He looked up twisting the stub of a cigarette between his grimy fingers
and fumbling for a match as the Tocsin and behind her the Magpie
short slim and wiry shrewdfaced with sharp quickglancing little
black eyes entered the room

Ello Larry grinned the Magpie Got yer breath back yet I felt it
through de windowpane when youse let go at de lamp

Ello Slimmy returned Jimmie Dale ungraciously speaking through the
corner of his mouth Ferget it

Sure said the Magpie unconcernedly He stared about him and finally
drawing a chair up to the table sat down motioned the Tocsin to do the
same and leaned forward amiably I didnt mean to throw no scare into
youse he said in a conciliating tone But I had a little business
wid Mag an I was kind of interested in whether she was entertainin
company or notsee I didnt know youse an Mag was workin together

Mabbe observed Jimmie Dale as ungraciously as before mabbe deres
some more tings youse dont know

Aw cough up de grouch advised the Magpie with a hint of impatience
creeping into his voice Youse dont need to be sore all night I told
youse I wasnt tryin to hand youse one didnt I

Never mind Larry Slimmy put in the Tocsin petulantly Hes down on
his luck dats all He aint had de price of a pinch of coke fer two

Oho exclaimed the Magpie grinning again So dats wots givin

The Magpie cocked his eye and stuck his tongue in his cheek

GOODnight he said tersely Nothin like dat Are youse on or aint

Well den wots in it fer me persisted Larrry the Bat

Moren de price of a coke sneeze returned the Magpie pertinently
Deres a century note fer youse an mabbe two or tree of dem fer

Larry the Bats eyes gleamed avariciously

Aw quit yer kiddin he said gruffly A century notefer me

divvy Im takin de chances youse has de soft end of it One century

straight aint it Well wot do youse say an say it quickcause if

declared Larry the Bat with sudden fervencyand stared anxiously
expectant at the Magpie Sure Im on Slimmy Sure I am Cut it
loose Spill de story

Well den said the Magpie I wants

Youse aint through yet interrupted the Tocsin tartly I aint heard
youse askin me nothin I aint on me uppers like Larry an mabbe de
price dont cut so much icesee

Aw said the Magpie with a smirk I dont have to ask youse on dis
lay Dis is where yoused come in on it fer marbles Say dis is where
we gets de hook into a guy by de name of Henry LaSalle Get me

HENRY LASALLE Under the table Jimmie Dales hand clenched suddenly
but not a muscle of his face moved save as with the tip of his tongue
he shifted the butt of the cigarette that was hanging royally from his
lower lip to the other corner of his mouth

Sure Shes got youse Slimmy he flung out with a grin as the
Tocsin wrinkled up her face menacingly and began to mumble to herself
Hes de guy dat handed her one when she was young an shes been
layin fer him ever since Sure I know Aint I worked him fer her till
I wears me shoes out tryin to get someting on him Sure shes in on
it Go on Slimmy wots de lay Wot do I do fer dat century

The Magpie hitched his chair closer to the table and as his sharp
little ferret eyes glanced around the room motioned the two to brings
their heads nearer

One of me influential broker friends down on Wall Street put me wise
he said with a wink Dats good enough fer youse two as far as dat
goes But take it from me I got it dead straight He lowered his voice
Say hes one of de richest mugs in New York aint he Well hes been
sellin stocks an bonds all day tousands an tousands of dollars
worthfer cash

All dem tings is always sold fer cash remarked Larry the Bat
fatuously

Aw ferget it said the Magpie earnestly Fer CASH I saidde coin
de long greenunderstand He wasnt shovin no checks fer what he sold
into de bank except to get dem cashed Dats wot hes been doin all
daygettin de checks cashed an gettin de money in big billssee I
know of one bunch of eighty tousandan dats only one

Wot fer inquired Larry the Bat It was the question that was pounding
at his brain as he stared innocently at the Magpie What did it mean
Why was Henry LaSalle turning and if the Magpie was right feverishly
turning every security he could lay his hands on into cash And then
in a flash the answer came THEY HAD NOT FOUND THE PACKAGE Equally
to them as to the Tocsin sitting there before him it meant life and
death If the package were found by the Tocsin instead of themselves
the game was up They were preparing for eventualities If they were
forced to run at a moments notice they at least were not going to
run emptyhanded Far from emptyhanded it seemed It would not be
difficult for the estates executor to realise a vast sum in short order
on instantly marketable giltedged securitiessay half a million
dollars Not very bulky eitherin large bills Five thousand
hundreddollar bills would make half a million It was astonishing
how small a hand bag say might hold a fortune Wot fer Slimmy he
inquired again wiggling his cigarette butt on his tongue tip Wotd he
do dat fer

How de hell do youse suppose I knows demanded the Magpie politely
scornful Dats his businessdat aint wots worryin me

Nosure it aint admitted Larry the Bat ingratiatingly But go on
keep movin Slimmy Wots he done wid de stuff

Done wid it echoed the Magpie with a short laugh Wot do youse
tink Hes been luggin it home to his swell joint up dere on de
avenoo an crammin his safe full of it

Larry the Bat sucked in his breath

Gee dats soft he murmured and then suddenly as though with
painful inspiration Say Slimmysay are youse sure youse aint been
handed a steer

The Magpie grinned wickedly

I aint fallin fer steers he said shortly Dis is on de level

Jimmie Dale lurched up from his chair and leaning over the lamp
chimney drew wheezily on his cigarette to get a light His eyes sought
the Tocsins face To all intents and purposes she was entirely absorbed
in the Magpie He sat down again to gape with wellstimulated doglike
admiration at Slimmy Joe WAS THIS TOO A PLANT Why had the Magpie
come to THEM with this story of Henry LaSalle And then the next
instant as the Magpie spoke his suspicions were allayed

Lets get down to cases the Magpie invited crisply I didnt blow
in here just by luck Dis Henry LaSalle is de guy youse worked fer once
aint he Mag Dats de spiel aint ithe sent youse up fer pinchin
de tacks out of his carpets

I never pinched nothin snarled Silver Mag truculently Hes a dirty
liar I never did

Cut it out Cut it out Can dat complained the Magpie patiently De
point is youse worked in his house didnt youse

Sure I did snapped the Tocsin sullenly aggressive but

Well den dats wot I want dats wot I come fer Maga plan of de
house See

Jimmie Dale could feel the Tocsins eyes upon him questioning
searching seeking a cue A plan of the houseyes or no And a decision
on the instant

Sure said Larry the Bat brightly Dats wot I was tinkin youse
were after all de time Say youse are all right Slimmy Youse are de
kind to work wid Go on Mag draw de dope fer Slimmy Dats better
dan tryin to put one over on de swell guy Disll make him squeal fer
fair

The Magpie produced a pencil and a piece of paper from his pocket and
laid them on the table in front of the Tocsin

Dere youse are he announced Help yerself an go to it Mag

The Tocsin evidently not quite certain of her part wet the pencil
doubtfully on the end of her tongue

I aint never drawed plans she said anxiously Mabbeshe glanced
at Jimmie Dalemabbe I dunno how to do it RIGHT

Aw go ahead nodded Larry the Bat Youse can do it right Mag Youse
dont have to make no oil paintin All de Magpie wants is de doors an
windows eh Slimmy

Sure agreed the Magpie encouragingly Dats all Mag Just mark
de rooms out on de first floor an de basement Youse can explain wot
youse re doin as youse goes along Ill get youse

The Tocsin cackled maliciously in assent and then while the Magpie got
up from his chair and stood peering over her shoulder she began to draw
labouriously her brows knitted the pencil hooked awkwardly between
crampedup forefinger and thumb

Larry the Bat slouched forward over the table his chin in his hands
appeared to watch the proceedings with mild interestbut his eyes like
a hawks were following every line on the paper transferring them to
his brain photographing every detail of the plan in his mind And as
he watched there seemed something that was near to the acme of all that
was ironical in the Magpie standing there his sharp little black eyes
drinking in greedily the Tocsins work in the Tocsin herself aiding and
abetting in the projected theftOF HER OWN MONEY How far would he let
the Magpie go He did not know Perhapswho could tellall the way
Between now and then there lay that package If it were at Makoffs at
Spider Jacks if he could find it get itthe Magpie as a temporary
custodian of the estates money would at least preclude its loss by
flight if the Crime Club took alarm too quickly Larry the Bats eyes
under halfclosed lids rested musingly on the Magpies face The Magpie
would not get very far away with it On the other hand if he failed at
Spider Jacks if after all he was wrong and the package had never
been there or if they had forestalled him turned the trick upon
him already secured it thenLarry the Bats lips working on his
cigarette formed in a twisted smilethen well then that was quite
another matter Perhaps he and the Magpie might not agree so far A half
million dollars was perhaps not much out of eleven millions but it was
a salvage not to be despised Why did he say half a million Well why
not If the Magpie knew of a single transaction of eighty thousand
and there had been many transactions during the day a half million was
little likely to prove an exaggerationand the less likely in view
of the fact that if those in the Crime Club were preparing for
an emergency they would not stint themselves in the disposal of
securities

The Magpie was keeping up a running fire of questions as the Tocsin
toiled on with her pencil Where did the hall lead to How many windows
in the library Did she remember the kind of fastenings Did the
servants sleep in the basement or above And finally twice over as
she finished the clumsy drawing and pushed it toward him he demanded
minute details of the position of the safe

Aw dats all right Slimmy Larry the Bat cut in airily If youse
ferget anyting when youse get in dere youse can ask me I got it
cinched

The Magpie folded the paper and stowed it carefully away in his pocket

Ask youse eh he grunted sarcastically An where do youse tink
yousell be about dat time

In dere wid youse of course replied Larry the Bat promptly Dats
wot youse said

Yes youse willNOT announced the Magpie with cold finality Do
youse tink I want to queer myself A hot one yoused be on an inside
job Yousell be OUTSIDE wid yer peepers skinned for de bullsyouse
an Mag here too See Get dat straight While Im on de job youse
two plays de game Now youse listen to me both of youse Dont start
nothin unless youse has to If its a cinch I got to make a getaway
youse two start a drunk fight Get me Youse know de lay Trow de talk
loudan Ill fade Dats all Well crack de crib earlyitll be
quiet enough up dere by one oclock

One oclock Larry the Bat shook his head What time was it now It was
about nine when he had first met the Tocsin then the Sanctuary then
the long walk as he had followed hersay a quarter of ten for that And
he had certainly been here with her not less than an hour and a half
It must be after eleven then One oclock And before that must come
Makoff and Spider Jack The night that half an hour ago had seemed so
sterile was crowding a program of events upon him nowtoo fast

Nothin doin he said thoughtfully Youse are in wrong dere Slimmy
One oclock dont go Say take it from me Ive watched dat guy
too many nights fer Mag Taint often he leaves de club before one
oclockan he aint never in bed before two

All right agreed the Magpie after a moments reflection Youse
ought to know Make it three oclock He pulled a cigar from his
pocket lighted it and leaning back in his chair stuck his feet up
on the table If youse dont mind Mag Ill stick around a while he
decided calmly Mabbe de less Im seen tonight de betteran I guess
dere wont be nobody lookin fer me here

Larry the Bat coughed suddenly and rose up a little heavily from his
chair He had not counted on that If the Magpie was settling down for
a prolonged stay it devolved upon him Jimmie Dale to get away and
at onceand without exciting the Magpies suspicions He coughed again
looked nervously from the Tocsin to the Magpiestammeredswallowed
hardand coughed once more

Well wots bitin youse inquired the Magpie ironically

Nothin said Larry the Batand hesitated Nothin only He
hesitated again and then the words in a rush

Say Slimmy couldnt youse come across wid a piece of dat century
now

Wot fer demanded the Magpie a little aggressively

Larry the Bat cleared his throat with a desperate effort

Youse knows he admitted sheepishly Just gimme de price of one
Slimmyjust one

Coke exploded the Magpie An get soaked to de eyesnot by a damn
sight

No Honest to Gawd no Slimmyjust one pleaded Larry the Bat

Nix said the Magpie shortly

Larry the Bat thrust out a hand before the Magpies eyes that shook
tremulously

I got to have it he declared with sudden fierceness I GOT tosee
Look at me I aint goin to be no good tonight if I dont I tell
youse I got to I aint goin to trow youse down Slimmyhonest I
aint Just onean itll set me up If I dont get none Ill be on de
rocks before mornin Dats straight Slimmyask Mag she knows

Aw let him go get it broke in the Tocsin wearily Dats de best
ting youse can do Slimmydeyre all alike when dey gets in his
class

Youse cocaine sniffers gives me de pip snorted the Magpie in
disgust He dug down into his pocket produced a bill and flung it
across the table to Larry the Bat Well dere youse are but youse
can take it from me Larry dat if youse gets whiffedhe swore
threateninglyIll crack every bone in yer face Get me

Slimmy said Larry the Bat fervently grabbing at the bill with a
hungry hand youse can count on me Ill be up dere on de job before
youse are Three oclock eh Well so long Slimmyhe slouched
eagerly to the door So long Maghe paused on the threshold for
a single quickflung significant glance See youse on de avenoo
MagIll be up dere before youse are So long

Oh so long said the Tocsin contemptuously

And an instant later Jimmie Dale closed the outer door behind him



CHAPTER XII

JOHN JOHANSSONFOURTWOEIGHT


Nearly midnight already It was even later than he had thought Larry
the Bat pressed his face against a shops windowpane on the Bowery for
a glance at a clock that had caught his eye on the wall within Nearly
midnight

He slouched on again hurriedly still debating in his mind as he
had been debating it all the way from the Tocsins the question of
returning again to the Sanctuary So far the way both to Spider Jacks
and the Sanctuary had been in the same directionbut the Sanctuary was
on the next street

Jimmie Dale reached the cornerand hesitated It was strange how strong
was the intuition upon him tonight that bade him go on and make all
speed to Spider Jackswhile equally strong was the cold stubborn
logic that bade him go first to the Sanctuary There were things that he
needed there that would probably be absolutely essential to him before
the night was out things without which he might be so badly handicapped
as to invite failure from the start and yetit was already midnight

Ostensibly both Makoff and Spider Jack closed their places at eleven
But that might mean anythingdepending upon their own respective
inclinations or on what of their own peculiar brand of deviltry might
be afoot If they were still about still in evidence he was still too
early midnight though it was though on the other hand if the coast
was clear he could ill afford to lose a moment of the time between
now and the hour that the Magpie had planned for the robbery of Henry
LaSalle for it would not be an easy matter even once inside Spider
Jacks to find that packagesince it was Spiders open boast that
things committed to his care were where the police or any one else
might as well whistle and suck their thumbs as try to find them

And then with sudden decision taking his hesitation as it were by
the throat Jimmie Dale hurried on againto the Sanctuary At most it
could delay him but another fifteen minutes and by halfpast twelve or
a quarter to one at the latest he would be at Spider Jacks

Disdaining the secrecy of the side door on the alley for who had a
better right or was better known there than Larry the Bat a tenant of
years he entered the tenement by the front door scuffled up the stairs
to the first landing and let himself into his disreputable room He
locked the door behind him lighted the choked and wheezy gas jet in a
single sharpflung glance assured himself that the blinds were tightly
shut and kneeling in the far corner threw back the oilcloth and
lifted up the loose section of the flooring beneath He reached inside
fumbling under the neatly folded clothes of Jimmie Dale and in a moment
laid his leather girdle with its kit of burglars tools on the floor
beside him and beside that again an electric flashlight a black silk
mask andwhat he had never expected to use again when early the night
before he had as he had believed put it away foreverthe thin metal
insignia case of the Gray Seal Another moment and with the flooring
replaced the oilcloth rolled back into position he had stripped off
his coat and was pulling his spotted greasy shirt off over his head
then stooping quickly he picked up the girdle put it on put on
his shirt again over it put on his coat put the metal case the
flashlight and the mask in his pocketsand once more the Sanctuary was
in darkness

It was perhaps fifteen minutes later that Jimmie Dale turned into the
upper section of Thompson Street Here he slowed his pace that had
been almost a run since he had left the Sanctuary and began to shuffle
leisurely along for the street that a few hours before would have been
choked with its pushcarts and venders its half naked children playing
where they could find room in the gutters its sidewalks thronged with
shawled women and picturesquely dressed earringed darkvisaged men
a scene as it were transported from some foreign land was still
far from deserted the quiet if quiet it could be called was but
comparative there were many yet about and he had no desire to attract
attention by any evidence of undue haste And besides Spider Jacks
was just ahead making the corner of the alleyway a few hundred feet
farther on and he had very good reasons for desiring to approach
Spiders little novelty store at a pace that would afford him every
opportunity for observation

On he shuffled along the street until reaching Spider Jacks a little
twostoried tumbledown brick structure a muttered exclamation of
satisfaction escaped him The shop was closed and dark and though
Spider Jack lived above the store there were no lights even in the
upper windows Spider Jack presumably was either out or in bed So far
then he could have asked for nothing more

Jimmie Dale edged in close to the building as he slouched by so close
that his hat brim seemed to touch the windowpane It was possible that
from a room at the rear of the store there might be a light with a
telltale ray perhaps filtering through say a door crack But there was
nothingonly blackness within

He paused at the corner of the building by the alleyway Down here
adjoining the high board fence of Spider Jacks back yard Makoff made
pretense at pawnbrokering in a small and dingy wooden building that was
little more pretentious than a shedand in Makoffs place so far as he
could see there was no light either

Jimmie Dales fingers were industriously rolling a cigarette as under
the brim of his slouch hat his eyes were noting every detail around
him A yard in against the wall of Spider Jacks the wall cutting
off the rays of the street lamp at a sharp angle it was shadowy and
blackand beyond that farther in the alleyway was like a pit It
would take less far less than the fraction of a second to gain that
yard but some one was approaching behind him and a little group of
people loitered with annoying persistency directly across the way on
the other side of the street Jimmie Dale stuck the cigarette between
his lips fumbled in his pockets and finally produced a box of matches
The group opposite was moving on now the footsteps he had heard behind
him those of a man drew nearer the man passed byand the box of
matches in Jimmie Dales hand dropped to the ground He reached to pick
them up and in his stooping posture without seeming to turn his head
flung a quick glance behind him up the street No one for that fraction
of a second that he needed was near enough to seeand in that fraction
of a second Jimmie Dale disappeared

A dozen yards down the lane he sprang for the top of the high fence
gripped it and lithe and active as a cat swung himself up and over
and dropped noiselessly to the ground on the other side Here he stood
motionless for a moment close against the fence to get his bearings
The rear of Spider Jacks building loomed up before himthe back
windows as unlighted as those in front Luck so far at least was with
him He turned and looked about him and his eyes growing accustomed to
the darkness he could just make out Makoffs place bordering the end
of the yardnor from this new vantage point could he discover
any more than before a single sign of life about the pawnbrokers
establishment

Jimmie Dale stole forward across the yard mounted the three steps of
the low stoop at Spider Jacks back door and tried the door cautiously
It was locked From his pocket came the small steel instrument that
had stood Larry the Bat in good stead a hundred times before in similar
circumstances He inserted it in the keyhole worked deftly with it
for an instantand tried the door again It was still locked And
then Jimmie Dale smiled almost apologetically Spider Jack did not use
ordinary locks on his back door

The discountenanced instrument went back into his pocket and now
Jimmie Dales hand slipped inside his shirt and from one of the little
upright pockets of the leather belt and from still another and from
after that a third came the vicious little bluedsteel tools The
sensitive fingers travelled slowly up and down the side of the doorand
then he was at work in earnest A minute passedanotherthere was a
dull low grating sound a snick as of metal yielding suddenlyand
Jimmie Dale was coolly stowing away his tools again inside his shirt

He pushed the door open an inch listened then swung it wide stepped
inside and closed it behind him A round white beam of light flashed
in a quick circleand went out It was a sort of storeroom innocent
enough and orderly enough in appearance barefloored with boxes and
packing cases piled neatly against the walls In one corner a staircase
led to the story aboveand from above quite audibly now he caught the
sound of snoring Spider Jack was in bed then

Directly facing him was the open door of another room and Jimmie Dale
moving softly forward entered it He had never been in Spider Jacks
before and his first concern was to form an intimate acquaintanceship
with his surroundings Again the flashlight circled and again went out

No windows muttered Jimmie Dale under his breath Nothing very fancy
about the architecture Three rooms in a row Store in front of this
room through that door of course Wonder if the doors locked though
its a foregone conclusion the package wouldnt be in there

Not a sound his tread silent he crossed to the closed door that he had
noticed It was unlocked and he opened it tentatively a little way
A faint glow of light diffused itself through the opening Jimmie Dale
nodded his head and closed the door again The street lamp shining
through the shop windows accounted for the light

And now the flashlight played with steady inquisitiveness about him
The room in which he stood seemed to combine a sort of office with
a lounging room in which Spider Jack no doubt entertained his
particular cronies There was table in the centre cards still upon it
chairs about it Against the wall farthest away from the shop stood
a huge oldfashioned cabinet and a little farther along anglewise
partitioning off the corner as it were hung for some purpose or
other a cretonne curtain Also against the wall next to the lane
bringing a commiserating smile to Jimmie Dales lips as his eyes fell
upon it was a clumsy lumbering antique safe

Jimmie Dales eyes returned to the curtain What was it doing there
What was it for Instinctively he stepped over to examine it A single
glance however as he lifted it aside sufficed It was nothing but
a makeshift clothes closet He turned from it switched off the
flashlight and stood staring meditatively into the darkness In a
strange house with the knowledge to begin with that what he sought was
carefully hidden it was no sinecure to find that package He had never
for a moment imagined that it would be But of one thing however there
was no uncertainty in his mindhe would get the packageby search
if possible by other means if search failed It was now close to one
oclock If by two oclock his efforts had been fruitless Spider Jack
would hand over the packageat the revolver point It was quite simple
MeanwhileJimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders and going over to
the safe knelt down in front of itmeanwhile as well begin here as
anywhere else

The trained fingers closed on the handleand on the instant as though
in startled amazement shifted to the dial They came back to the
handlea wrenchthen a low amused chuckleand the door swung open
The great unwieldy thing was only a monumental bluff It not only had
not been locked but it COULD NOT be lockedthe mechanism was out of
order the bolts could not be moved by so much as a hairs breadth

Still chuckling Jimmie Dale shot the flashlights ray into the interior
of the safeand the chuckle died on his lips and into his face came a
look of strained bewilderment Inside everything was in chaos
books papers a miscellany of articles as though they had first been
ruthlessly pulled out on the floor then gathered up in an armful and
crammed back inside again For an instant he did not move and then a
queer hard mirthless smile drew down the corners of his mouth With a
sort of bitter expectant nod of his head he turned the light upon the
door of the safe Yes there were the scratches that the tools had left
and as though in sardonic jest the holes where the steel bit had
bored were plugged with putty and rubbed over with some black substance
that was still wet and came off smearing his finger as he touched it
It could not have been done long ago then How long A half houran
hour Not more than that

Mechanically he closed the door of the safe rose to his feet and
almost heedless of noise now the flashlight ray dancing before him
he jumped across to the oldfashioned cabinet and pulled the door open
Here as within the safe all inside plain evidence of thorough if
hasty search was scattered and tossed about in hopeless confusion

He shut the cabinet door the flashlight went out and he stood like
a man stunned the sense of some abysmal disaster upon him He was too
late The game was up If it had ever been here the package was gone
nowGONE The Crime Club had been here before him

The game was up The game was uphis mind seemed to keep on
repeating that The Crime Club had beaten him by an hour at most
and had been here and had searched It was strange though that they
should have been at such curious pains to cover their tracks by leaving
the room in order by such paltry efforts to make the safe appear
untouched when the first glance that was at all critical would disclose
immediately what had been done Why should they need to cover their
tracks at all or if it was necessary why above all in such a
pitifully inadequate way His mind barked back to the same ghastly
refrainthe game was up

NO Not yet There was still a chance There was still Spider Jack
Suppose in spite of their search they had failed to find the package
Jimmie Dales lips set in a thin line as he started abruptly toward
the door There was still that chance and one thing was grimly
certainSpider Jack would at least show him where the package HAD
BEEN

And then halfway to the door he halted suddenly and stood
stilllistening An electric bell was ringing loudly imperiously
somewhere upstairs Followed almost immediately the sound of some one
Spider Jack presumably moving hurriedly about overhead and then a
moment later steps coming down the staircase in the adjoining room

Jimmie Dale drew back flattening himself against the wall Spider Jack
entered the room stumbled across it in the darkness fumbled for the
door that led into his little shop opened it passed through fumbled
around in there again for matches evidently then lighted a gas jet in
the store and going to the street door opened it

Jimmie Dale had edged along the wall a little to a position where he had
an unobstructed view through the open doorway connecting the shop and
the room in which he stood Spider Jack in trousers and shirt hastily
donned no doubt as he had got out of bed was standing in the street
doorway and beyond him loomed the forms of several men Spider Jack
stepped aside to allow his visitors to enterand suddenly a cry barely
suppressed upon his lips Jimmie Dale involuntarily strained forward
Three men had entered but his eyes were fixed fascinated upon
only onethe first of the three Was it an hallucination Was he
maddreaming It was Hilton Travers THE CHAUFFEURthe man whom he
could have sworn he had last seen dead lashed in that chair in that
ghastly death chamber of the Crime Club

Rather rough on you Spider to pull you out of bed at this hour the
chauffeur was saying apologetically

Oh thats all right seein its you Travers Spider Jack answered
gruffly amiable Only I was kind of lookin for you last night

I know the chauffeur replied but I couldnt connect with my friends
here Shake hands with them SpiderBob MarvinHarry Stead

Glad to know you gents said Spider Jack with a handgrip apiece

The chauffeur lowered his voice a little

I suppose were alone here eh Spider Yes Well then you know what
Ive come forthat packageMarvin and Stead here are the ones that
are in on it with me Get it for me will you Spider

SureMr Johansson Spider grinned Sure Come on into the back room
and make yourselves comfortable Ill be mabbe five minutes or so

Jimmie Dales brain was whirling What did it mean He could not seem
to understand His mind seemed to refuse its functions Travers the
chauffeurALIVE He drew in his breath sharply That curtain in the
corner He must see this out now They were coming Quick noiseless
he stole along the side of the wall reached the corner and slipped in
behind the curtain as Spider Jack striking a match entered the room

Spider Jack lighted the gas and as the others followed behind him
waved them toward the chairs around the table

Ill just ask you gents not to leave the room he said meaningly over
his shoulder as he stepped toward the rear door Its kind of a fad of
mine to keep some things even from my wife

All right SpiderI understand the chauffeur returned readily

Jimmie Dales knife cut a tiny slit in the cretonne on a level with his
eyes The three men had seated themselves at the table and appeared to
be listening intently Spider Jacks footsteps echoed back as he crossed
the rear room sounded dull and muffled descending the stoop outside
and died away

I told you it wasnt in the house the man who had been introduced as
Stead laughed shortly We wasted the hour we had here

The third man spoke crisply incisively to the chauffeur

Turn down that gas jet a little Youve got across with it so farbut
you cant stand a searchlight Clarke

And at the words in a flash the meaning of it all of it to the last
detail that was spelling death ruin and disaster for her the Tocsin
for himself as well burst upon Jimmie Dale That VOICE He would have
known it recognised it among a thousandit was the masked man of the
night before the leader the head of the Crime Club And it was not
Travers there at all He remembered now too well that second room they
had showed him in the Crime Clubits multitude of disguises though
in this case they had the dead mans clothes ready to their handsthe
leaders boast that impersonation was but childs play to them And now
he understood why they had covered up the traces of their search in only
so curiously inadequate a manner They had failed to find the package
and as a last resort had adopted the ruse of impersonating Hilton
Travers the chauffeur which made it necessary that when they called
Spider Jack from his bed as they had just done that Spider Jack at a
CASUAL glance should notice nothing amissbut it would be no more than
a casual glance for who should know better than they he would not
have to go for the package to any place that they had disturbed And he
Jimmie Dale could only stand here and watch them helpless powerless
to move Three of them A step out into the room was to invite certain
death It would not matter his deathif he could gain anything
for her for the Tocsin by it But what could he gainby dying He
clenched his hands until the nails bit into the flesh

Spider Jack reentered the room carrying what looked like a large
bulky manila envelope heavily sealed in his hand He tossed it on the
table

There you are Travers he said

I wonder suggested the leader pleasantly if now that were here
Travers your friend would mind letting us have this room for a few
minutes to ourselves to clean up the business

Sure agreed Spider Jack cordially Youre welcome to it Ill wait
out here in the store until you say the word

He went out closing the door after him The leader picked up the
package

Well take no chances with this he said grimly Its been too close
a call After weve had a look at it well put it out of harms way on
the spot here while weve got itbefore we leave

He ripped the package open and disclosed perhaps a dozen
officiallooking documents besides a miscellaneous number of others
He took up the first of the papers glanced through it hurriedly then
tossed it to the pseudo chauffeur

Tear it up and tear it upSMALL he ordered tersely The next
after examining it as he had the first he tossed to the other man Go
aheadcurtly Work fast From the looks of these Travers had us
cold Theres proof enough here of LaSalles murder to send us all to
the chair

He went on glancing through the documents and then suddenly joining
the others in their work began to rip and tear at the papers himself

A sort of cold horror had settled upon Jimmie Dale and his forehead
was clammy wet The inhuman irony of it That he should stand there and
watch impotent to prevent it the destruction of what he would have
given his life to secure And then slowly a grim hard merciless smile
came to his lips He had recognised the leaders voicenow he would
recognise the leaders FACE At least that was left to himperhaps the
master trump of all It would not be very hard to find the Crime Club
nowwith that man to lead the way

The scraps of paper tiny shreds mounted into a heap on the tableand
with the last of the contents of the package destroyed the leader stood
up

Put these pieces in your pockets we dont want to leave them here he
directed quietly And then lets get out

In scarcely a moment the last scrap of paper had vanished The three
men walked to the door passed through it and joined Spider Jack in the
storeand Jimmie Dale slipping out from behind the curtain gained the
door of the rear room crept through it reached the stoop and then
darting like the wind across the yard was over the fence in a second
and in another was out of the alleyway and on the street

He was in timein plenty of time They had just left Spider Jacks
and were perhaps fifty yards or so ahead of him He slouched on behind
themthe cold grim smile on his lips once more It was the Crime Club
now that hells cradle where their devils schemes were hatched
that was the one thing left to him they would lead him to that and
thenand then it would be his turn to STRIKE

They turned the first corner And suddenly as the racing engine of an
automobile caught his ear he broke into a run and dashed around the
corner after themin time to see them jump into a car and the car
speed off along the street He halted as though he were suddenly
dazedstarted involuntarily to run forward againstopped with a hollow
laugh at the futility of itand stood still and motionless on the
sidewalk

And then he swayed a little and his face grew gray Failure defeat
ruinin that moment he knew them all to their bitterest dregs How
could he go to her How could he face her and tell her that they were
beaten that the last hope was gone that he had failed

God he cried aloud and clenched his hands

Then deep in his consciousness a thought stirred and he swept a shaking
hand across his eyes Why had it come again that thought Did it mean
that HE must playthe last card There was a waythere had always been
a way The way the Crime Club tookMURDER It was their own weapon
If the man who posed as Henry LaSalle were killed If that manwere
killed

The Magpie was to be there at three he mutteredand started
mechanically back along the street



CHAPTER XIII

THE ONLY WAY


It was a horrible thingand it grew upon him In a blind mechanical
way his brain receptive to nothing else Jimmie Dale walked on along
the street To kill a man Death he had faced himself a hundred times
witnessed it a hundred times in its most violent forms had seen murder
done before his eyes had been in straits where to save his own life
it had seemed the one last desperate chanceand yet his hands were
still clean To kill a man in fair fight in struggle when the blood
was hot was terrible enough a possibility that was always before him
the one thing from which he shrank the one thing that as the Gray
Seal he had always feared but to kill a man deliberately to creep
upon his victim with hideous coldblooded premeditationhe shivered a
little and his hand shook as he drew it nervously across his eyes

But there was no other way Again and again insidiously grappling with
his revulsion with the horror that the impulse to murder inspired
came that other thoughtthere was no other way If the man who posed
as Henry LaSalle were DEAD If he were dead If he were dead See now
what would happen if that man were dead How clear his brain was on that
point The whole plot would tumble like a house of cards about the heads
of the Crime Club The courts would require an auditing of the estate
by a trustee of the courts own appointing who would continue to
administer it until the Tocsins twentyfifth birthday or until there
was tangible evidence of her deathbut the Tocsin automatically with
her pseudo uncles death could publicly appear again Her death could
no longer benefit the Crime Club since it the Crime Club with the
supposed uncle dead could not profit through the false Henry LaSalle
inheriting as next of kin It was the weak link the vulnerable point in
the stupendous scheme of murder and crime with which these hell fiends
had played for and won so far the stake of eleven millions Not that
they had overlooked or been blind to this they were too clever too
cunning for thatit was only that they had planned to accomplish the
Tocsins death as they had her fathers and uncles and ESTABLISH
the false Henry LaSalle in undisputed possession and ownership of the
estateand had failed in thatup to the present But the material
results remained the same so long as the Tocsin to save her life
was forced to remain in hiding so long as proof that would convict the
Crime Club was not forthcomingSO LONG AS THAT MAN LIVED

Time passed to which Jimmie Dale was oblivious At times he walked
slowly scarcely moving at times his pace was a nervous hurried
stride that was almost a run And as he was oblivious to time so was
he oblivious to his surroundings to the direction which he took
At times his forehead was damp with moisture that was not there from
physical exertion at times his face deathly white was full as of
the vision of some shuddering abhorrent sight at times his lips were
thinned into a straight line and there was a glitter in the dark eyes
that was not good to see while his hands at his sides clenched until
the skin tight over the knuckles was an ivory white To kill a man

What other way was there The proof that it had taken Hilton Travers
years to obtain the proof on which the Tocsins life depended was
destroyed utterly irreparably It could never be duplicatedHilton
Travers was deadMURDERED Murder That thought again It was their
own weapon Murder Would one kill a venomous reptile in whose fangs
was death What right had this man to life whose life was forfeit even
under the lawfor murder Was she to drag on an intolerable existence
among the dregs and the scum of the underworld she in her refinement
and her purity to exist among the vile and dissolute in daily hourly
peril of her life because the weapons that these inhuman vultures
had used to rob her to destroy those she loved to make of her life a
hideous joyless thing should not be used against them

But to kill a man To steal upon a man with cold intent in the blackness
of the nightand take his life To be a murderer To know the horror
of blood forever upon ones hands to rise coldsweated in the night
fearful of the very shadows around one to live with every detail of
that fearsome act sweeping like some dread spectre at unexpected moments
upon the consciousness He put up his hands before his face as though
to blot out the thought from him Mind and soul recoiled before itto
kill a man

He walked on and on until at last conscious of a sense of fatigue he
stopped He must have come a long way been walking a long time Where
was he He looked about him for a moment in a dazed wayand suddenly
with a low cry shrank back As though he had been drawn to it by
some ghastly magnet he found himself standing in front of the LaSalle
mansion on Fifth Avenue No no it was not for that he had cometo
kill a man It was onlyonly to get that money Yeshe remembered
nowthat money from the safe before the Magpie got it The Magpie was
to be there at three oclockand the Tocsin was to be there too The
Tocsin That package He had failed It had been her one hope andand
it was gone What could he say to her How could he tell her the
miserable truth Butbut he had not come there in the dead of night to
kill a man these other things were what had

Jimmie It was a quickbreathed whisper A hand was on his arm

He turned startled It was the TocsinSilver Mag

Jimmie in alarm Why are you standing here like this You may be
SEEN

Seen Suppose he WERE seen He shuddered a little

Yes thats so he said hoarsely He glanced numbly up and down the
wide deserted but welllighted avenue It was no place that most
aristocratic section of the city for such as Silver Mag and Larry
the Bat to be seen at that hour of night or rather morning And if
anything HAPPENED inside that house II didnt think of that he
said mechanically

Come across the streetunder the stoop of that house there She had
his arm and was half dragging him as she spoke the alarm in her voice
intensified And then a moment later safe from observation Jimmie
Jimmie what is the matter What has happened What makes you act so
strangely

Nothing he said I

TELL me she insisted wildly

And then with a violent effort Jimmie Dale forced his mind back to the
immediate present He was only inspiring her with terrorand there was
the Magpieand that money in the safe

Where is the Magpie he asked with quick apprehension Am I late Is
he in there already

No she said He hasnt come yet

What time is it he demanded anxiously

About halfpast two she replied But Jimmie

Wait he broke in Where is he now You were both together And
you were both to be here at three What are you doing here alone at
halfpast two

A strange little exclamation one almost of dismay it seemed escaped
her

The Magpie left my place an hour agoto get his kit I think And I
came here at once because that was what you and I understood I was to
do wasnt it Jimmie you frighten me You are not yourself Dont
you remember the last words you said as you nodded to me behind the
Magpies backthat you would be here BEFORE us There was no mistaking
your meaningif I could get away from him I was to come here and meet
you

Jimmie Dale passed his hand nervously across his eyes Of course he
remembered now What a frightful turmoil his brain had been in

Yes of course He tried to speak nonchalantly I had forgotten for
the moment

She caught his arm in a quick tight hold shaking him in a terrified
way

YOUforget a thing like that Jimmiesomething terrible has happened
Cant you see that I am nearly mad with anxiety What is it What is it
That package Jimmieis it the package

He did not answer What could he say It meant life hope joy
everything that the world held for herand it was gone

Yesit IS the package she whispered frantically Quick Jimmie
Tell me Itit was not there Youyou could not find it

It was there he said as though the words were literally forced from
him

Then ThenWHAT Jimmie The clutch on his arm was like a vise

They got it he said It was like a death sentence that he pronounced
It is destroyed

She did not speak or movesave that her hands as though nerveless and
without strength fell away from his arms and dropped to her sides It
was dark there under the stoop though not so dark but that he could see
her face It was graygray as death And there was misery and fear
and a pitiful helplessness in itand then she swayed a little and he
caught her in his arms

Gone she murmured in a dead colourless wayand suddenly laughed out
sharply hysterically

Dont For Gods sake dont do that he pleaded wildly

She looked at him then for a moment in strange quietand lifted her
hand and stroked his face in a numbed way

Itit would have been better Jimmie wouldnt it she said in the
same monotonous voice it would have been better ifif I had never
found out anything and theythey had done the same to me that they did
toto father

Marie Marie It was the first time he had ever spoken her name and
it was on his lips now in an agony of tenderness and appeal Dont You
mustnt speak like that

Im tired she said II cant fight any more

She did not cry She lay there in his arms quite stilllike a weary
child

The minutes passed When Jimmie Dale spoke again it was
irrelevantlyand his face was very white

Marie describe the upper floor of that house over there for me

She roused herself with a start

The upper floor she repeated slowly Whywhy do you ask that

Have YOU forgotten in turn he said with a steady smile That money
in the safeits yourswe can at least save that out of the wreck You
only drew the basement plan and the first floor for the Magpiethe
more I know about the house the better of course in case anything goes
wrong Now see try and be braveand tell me quickly for I must get
through before the Magpie comes and I have barely half an hour

No Jimmieno She slipped out of his arms Let it alone I am
afraid SomethingII have a feeling that something will happen

It is the only way He said it involuntarily more to himself than to
her

Jimmie let it alone she said again

No he said I am goingso tell me quickly Every minute that we
wait is one that counts against us

She hesitated an instantand then speaking rapidly made a verbal
sketch of the upper portion of the house for him

Its a very large house isnt it he commented innocentlyto pave
the way for the question above all others that he had to ask Which
is your uncles I mean that mans room

The first on the right at the head of the landing she answered
Only Jimmie dontdont go

He drew her close to him again

Now listen he said quietly When the Magpie comes and finds I am
not here lead him to think that the money he gave me was too much for
me that I am probably in some den doped with drugand hold him as
long as you can on the pretext that there is always the possibility I
may after all show up before he goes in there You understand And
now about yourselfyou must do exactly as I say On no account allow
yourself to be seen by ANY ONE except the Magpie I would tell you to
go now only unless it is vitally necessary we cannot afford to
arouse the Magpies suspicionshed have every crook in the underworld
snarling at our heels But you are not to wait even for him if you
detect the slightest disturbance in that house before he comes And
equally after he has gone in whether I have come out or not at the
first indication of anything unusual you are to get away at once You
understandMarie

Yes she said Butbut Jimmie you

Just one thing more He smiled at her reassuringly Did the Magpie
say anything about how he intended to get in

Yesby the side away from the corner of the street she said
tremulously You see theres quite a space between the house and the
one next door and besides the house next door is closed up theres
nobody there the family has gone away for the summer The library
window there is low enough to reach from the ground

For a moment longer he held her close to him as though he could not let
her gothen bent and kissed her passionately And in that moment all
the emotions he had known as he had walked blindly from Spider Jacks
that night surged again upon him and that voice was whispering
whispering whispering It is the only wayit is the only way

And then not daring to trust his voice he released her suddenly
and stepped back out from under the stoopand the next instant he was
across the deserted avenue Another and he had slipped through the
iron gates that opened on the street drivewayand in yet another he was
crouched close up against the front door of the LaSalle mansion

It was a large house a very large house one of the few that even
amid the wealth and luxury of that quarter boasted its own grounds and
those so restricted as scarcely to deserve the name but it was set far
enough back from the street to escape the radius of the street lamps
and so guarantee in its shadows security from observation It was not
the Magpies way the front doorthe obvious to the Magpie and his ilk
was a thing always to be shunned Jimmie Dales lips were set in a
grim smile as his fingers worked with lightning speed now taking this
instrument and now that from the leather pockets in the girdle beneath
his shirtthe penitentiaries were full of Magpies who shunned the
obvious

Very slowly very cautiously the door opened He listened breathlessly
tensely The door closed againbehind him He was inside now
Stillness Blackness Not a sound A minute went byanother And then
as he stood there strained listening the silence itself began it
seemed to palpitate and pound pound pound and be full of strange
noises It was a horrible thingto kill a man



CHAPTER XIV

OUT OF THE DARKNESS


A moment later Jimmie Dale stepped forward through the vestibule
He was quite calm now a sort of cold merciless precision in every
movement succeeding the riot of turbulent emotions that had possessed
him as he had entered the house

The half hour the maximum length of time before the Magpie would
appear as he had estimated it when out there under the stoop with the
Tocsin had dwindled now to perhaps twenty minutes twentyfive at the
outside Twentyfive minutes Twentyfive minutes was so little that for
an instant the temptation was strong upon him to sacrifice rather
than any of those precious minutes the Magpie instead And then in the
darkness as he stole noiselessly across the hall he shook his head It
would be a cowardly brutal thing to do What chance would a man with a
record like the Magpies stand if caught there How easy it would be
to shift the murder of the supposed Henry LaSalle to the Magpies
shoulders Jimmie Dales lips closed firmly Selfpreservation was
perhaps the first law but he would save the Magpie if he couldthe
Magpie should have his chance The man might be a criminal might
deserve punishment at the hands of the law his liberty might be a
menace to the communitybut he was not a murderer his life forfeit for
a crime he had never committed

If he Jimmie Dale could only in some way have arranged with the Tocsin
out there to keep the Magpie away altogether But it could not be done
without arousing the Magpies suspicions and as a corollary to that
afterward with the subsequent events would comethe deluge The law
of the underworld was clear concise and admitting of no appeal on that
point to double cross a pal meant sooner or later a knife thrust a
blackjack orBut what difference did it make what form the execution
of the sentence took And since then that was out of the question
since he could not keep the Magpie away without practically risking his
own life the Magpie at least must have his chance

Jimmie Dale was at the library door now that according to the plan the
Tocsin had drawn for the Magpie and as he remembered her description
when she had told him her story earlier in the evening was just at the
foot of the staircase How dark it was Though the stairs could be only
a few feet away he could not see them And how intense the silence was
again Here where he stood the slightest stir from above must have
reached himbut there was not a sound

His hand felt out for the doorknob found it turned it and pushed the
door open He stepped inside the room and closed the door behind him
The safe according to the Tocsins plan again was in that sort of
alcove at the lower end of the library Jimmie Dales flashlight played
inquisitively about the room There was the window the only one in the
room the window through which the Magpie proposed to enter there
was the archway of the alcove with itsno there were no longer any
portieres and there was the safe he could see it quite plainly from
where he stood at the upper end of the room

The flashlight went out for the space of perhaps thirty secondsthirty
seconds of absolute silence absolute stillnessthen the round white
ray of the light again but glistening now on the nickel knobs and dial
of the safeand Jimmie Dale was on his knees before it

A low scarcely breathed exclamation that seemed to mingle anxiety
and hesitation escaped him He who knew the make of every safe in the
country knew this one for its true worth Twentyfive minutes Could he
open it in that time let alone with any time to spare It was not
like the one in Spider Jacks it was the kind that the Magpie however
clever he might be in his own way would be forced to negotiate with
soup and with the attendant noise double his chance of discovery
and captureand the responsibility for what might have happened
UPSTAIRS No the Magpie must have his chance And besides the money
in the safe apart why should not he Jimmie Dale have his own chance
as well All this would help The motiverobbery the perpetrator
there was grim mockery on his lips now as the light went out and the
sensitive fingers closed on the knob of the dial the perpetratorthe
Gray Seal It would afford excellent food for the violent editorial
diatribes under which the police again would writhe in frenzy

Stillness again Silence Only a low tense breathing only so faint
that it could not be heard a foot away a curious scratching as from
time to time the supersensitive fingers fell away from the dial to rub
upon the carpetto increase even their sensitiveness by setting the
nerves to throbbing through the skin surface at the tips And then
Jimmie Dales head ear pressed close against the safe to catch the
tumblers fall was liftedand the flashlight played again on the dial

Twentyeight and a quarterleft

How fast the time wentand how slowly Still the black shape crouched
there in the darkness against the safe At times in strange ghostly
flashes the nickel dial with the ray upon it seemed to leap out and
glisten through the surrounding blackness at times the quick intake of
breath as from great exertion at times faint musical little clicks
as after abortive effort the dial whirled preparatory to a fresh
attempt And then at lasta gasp of relief

Ah

Came the sound barely audible as of steel sliding in welloiled
grooves the muffled thud of metal meeting metal as the bolts shot
backand the heavy door swung outward

Jimmie Dale stretched his cramped limbs and wiped the moisture from
his facethen set to work again upon the inner door This was an easier
matterfar easier Five minutes perhaps a little more went byand
then the inner door was open and the flashlights ray was flooding the
interior of the safe

A queer little sound half of astonishment half of disappointment
issued from Jimmie Dales lips There was money here a great deal
of money undoubtedly but there was no such sum as he had somehow
fantastically imagined from the Magpies evidently overcoloured story
that there would be there was money ten packages of banknotes neatly
piled in the bottom compartmentbut there was no half million of
dollars He picked up one of the packages hurriedlyand drew in
his breath After all there was a great dealthe notes were
of hundreddollar denomination and on the bottom were two
onethousanddollar bills Calculated roughly if each of the other
nine packages contained a like amount the total must exceed a hundred
thousand

And now Jimmie Dale began to work with feverish haste From the leather
girdle inside his shirt came the thin metal insignia caseand a gray
seal was stuck firmly on the dial knob of the safe This done he tucked
away the packages of banknotes some into his pockets and some inside
his shirt and then quickly ransacked the interior of the safe
flauntingly spilling the contents of drawers and pigeonholes out upon
the floor

He stood up and leaving the safe door wide open walked back across
the room to the window unfastened the catch and opened the window an
inch or two The way was open now for the Magpie The Magpie would have
no need to make any noise in forcing an entrance he would be able to
see almost at a glance that he had been forestalledby the Gray Seal
and that as far as he was concerned the game was up The Magpie had
his chance If the Magpie did not take the hint and make his escape as
noiselessly as he had enteredit was his own fault He Jimmie Dale
had given the Magpie his chance

Jimmie Dale turned from the window and made his way out of the library
to the foot of the stairs leaving the library door open behind him How
long had he been Was it more or less than the twentyfive minutes He
did not knowonly as yet the Magpie had not come and now perhaps it
did not make so much difference

Where was he going now His foot was on the first stairand suddenly he
drew it back the cold sweat bursting out on his forehead Where was
he going now THE FIRST ROOM ON THE RIGHT AT THE HEAD OF THE LANDING
From his inner consciousness as it were the answer in all the bald
naked horror that it implied flashed upon him The first room on the
rightTHAT mans room God how the darkness and the stillness began
to palpitate again and suddenly seem to shriek out at him over and over
the one single ghastly wordMURDER

It had been with him that thought all the time he had been working
at the safe but it had been there then only subconsciously like some
heavy nameless dread subjugated for the moment by the work he had
had to do which had demanded the centred attention of every faculty he
possessed But now the moment had come when there was only THAT before
him only that nothing elseonly that the man upstairs in the first
room to the right of the landing

Why did he hesitate Why did he stand there while the priceless moments
before daylight came were passing The man was a murderer a blotch on
society and his life already forfeited he was living now only because
the law had not found him outthe man was a criminal bloodstainedand
his life because he had taken her fathers life and had tried to take
the Tocsins own life stood between her and every hope of happiness
robbing her even literally in a material sense of everything that
the world could hold for her Why did he hesitate It was that mans
lifeor hers It was the only way

He put his foot upon the bottom step againpaused still another
instantand then began stealthily to mount the stairs The darkness
There had never been it seemed such darkness before The stillnesshe
had never known silence so heavy so full of strange premonitory
pulsings a silence that seemed so incongruously full of clamouring
whispers in his ears It must be those imagined whispers that were
affecting his nervefor now as he gained the landing and slipped his
automatic from his pocket his hand was shaking with a queer twitching
motion

For an instant fighting for his selfcomposure he stood striving
to locate his surroundings through the darkness The staircase was a
circular one making the landing nearly at the front of the house and
rearward from this the Tocsin had said a hallway ran down the centre
with rooms on either side The first room to the right therefore
should be just at his hand He reached out feeling cautiouslythere
was nothing He edged to the rightstill nothing edged a little
farther a sense of bewilderment growing upon him and finally his
fingers touched the wall It was very strange The hallway must be much
wider than he had understood it to be from what she had said

He moved along now straight ahead of him his hand on the wall feeling
for the doorand with every step his bewilderment increased Surely
there must be some mistakeperhaps he had misunderstood He had come
fully twice the distance that one would expectand yet there was
no door Ah what was that His fingers closed on soft heavy velvet
hangings These could hardly be in front of a door and yetwhat else
could it be He drew the hangings warily apart and felt behind them It
was a window but it was shuttered in some way evidently for he could
not see out

Jimmie Dale stood motionless there for fully a minute It seemed absurd
preposterous the conviction that was being forced home upon himthat
there were no rooms on the righthand side of the corridor at all
But that was not like the Tocsin accurate always in the most minute
details The room must be still farther along He was tempted to use
his flashlightbut that as long as he could feel his way was an
unnecessary risk A flashlight upstairs where a sleepingroom door
might be ajar or even wide open where some one wakeful THAT man
himself perhaps might see it was quite another matter than a
flashlight in the closed and deserted library below

He went on once more still guiding himself by a light finger touch upon
the wall passed another portiere similar to the first and after that
anotherand finally stopped by bringing up abruptly against the end
wall of the house It was certainly very strange There WERE no rooms
on the righthand side of the corridor And here hanging across the end
wall was another of those ubiquitous velvet portieres He parted it
and a little to his surprise found a window that was not shuttered
but that instead was heavily barred by an ornamental grille work He
could see out however and found that he was looking directly out
from the rear of the house A lamp from the side street threw what was
undoubtedly the garage into shadowy outline and he made out below him
a short stretch of yard between the garage and the house He remembered
that nowshe had described all that to the Magpie There was no
driveway between the front and the rear The house being on the corner
the entrance to the garage was directly from the side street Yes she
had described all that exactly as it was buthe dropped the portiere
and faced around carrying his hand in a nonplused way to his eyesbut
here upstairs within the house it was not as she had said it was at
all What did it mean She could not have blundered so egregiously as
that unlesshe caught his breath suddenlyunless she had done so
intentionally Was that it Had she surmised formed a suspicion of
what was in his mind of what he meant to doand taken this means of
defeating it If sowell it was too late for that now There was
one wayonly one way Whatever the cost whatever it might mean for
himthere was only one way out for her

His flashlight was in his hand now and the round white ray shot down
the corridorseemed suddenly to falter unsteadilyswept in through an
open door that was almost beside himand then as though a nerveless
hand held it the ray dropped and played shakily on the toe of his boot
before it went out

A stifled cry rose to his lips Something cold like a hand of ice
seemed to clutch at his heart Those portieres the wide richly
carpeted corridor It was the corridor of the night before That room at
his side was the room where he had seen Hilton Travers the chauffeur
dead lashed in a chair He felt the sweat beads burst out anew upon his
forehead

IT WAS THE CRIME CLUB



CHAPTER XV

RETRIBUTION


His brain seemed to whirl staggered as by some gigantic ghastly
mockery The Crime Club HERE He had thought to creep upon that
manand he had run blindly into the very heart and centre of these hell
fiends nest

Silently he stood there holding his breath as he listened now
motionless as a statue forcing his mind to THINK He remembered that
last night his impression of the place had been that it was more like
some great private mansion than anything else Well he had been right
it seemed He could have laughed aloudsardonically hysterically It
was not so strange now that there were no rooms on the righthand side
of the corridor And what could have suited their purpose better what
by its very location its unimpeachable character could be a more ideal
lair for them than this house And how grimly simple it was now the
explanation In the five years that the false Henry LaSalle had been in
possession they had cunningly remodelled the upper floorthat was all
It was quite clear now why the man never entertainedwhy he had never
been caught or found or known to be in communication with his fellow
conspirators It was no longer curious that one might watch the door of
the house for months at a stretch and go unrewarded for ones pains as
the Tocsin had done when access to the house by those who frequented it
was so easy through the garage on the side streetand from the garage
if their work there was in keeping with their clever contrivances
within the house by an underground connection into say the cellar or
basement

Again Jimmie Dale checked that nervous unnatural inclination to laugh
aloud Was there anything any single incident any single detail of all
that had transpired that was not explained borne out as it could be
explained and borne out in no other way save that the Crime Club should
be no other than this very house itself It was the exposition of
that favourite theory of hisit was so obvious that therein lay its
security He had mocked at the Magpie not many moments before on that
scoreand now it was the beam in his own eye It was so obvious now so
glaringly obvious that the Crime Club could have been nowhere else so
obvious with every word of the Tocsins story pointing it out like a
signpostand he had not seen it

And then suddenly every muscle grew strained and rigid WAS THERE SOME
ONE IN THE CORRIDOR Was it some one movingor was it only fancy He
listenedwhile he strained his eyes through the darkness There was no
sound only that abnormal heavy silence thatyes he remembered that
too nowthat had clung about him last night like a pall He could
see nothing hear nothingbut intuitively bringing a cold dismay the
greater because it was something unknown intangible he FELT as though
eyes were upon him that even in the darkness he was being watched

And as he stood there then slowly there crept upon Jimmie Dale the
sense of peril and disaster It was not intuition nowit was certainty
He was trapped It was the part of a fool to imagine that with their
devils cunning their cleverness their ingenuity he or any one else
could enter that house unknown to its occupants Had he made electric
contact when he had opened the front door and rung a signal here
perhaps upstairshad he set some system of alarm at work when he had
touched that window What did it matterthe details that had heralded
his entrance He was certain now that his presence in the house was
known Only why had they left him so long without attack He shook his
head with a quick impatient movement That too was obvious He was
under observation Who was he Why had he come Was he simply a paltry
safetapperor was he one whom they had a real need to fear And then
too there might well be another reason It was far from likely in fact
unreasonable to imagine that all the men he had seen here the night
before were in the house now Not many of them if any would LIVE here
for CONSTANT daily coming and going even through the garage could
not escape notice and of the servants probably a lesser breed of
criminal some of them at least no doubt were engaged at that
moment in watching his own house on Riverside Drive There was even
the possibility that the man posing as Henry LaSalle was for the time
being here alone

He shook his head again He could hardly hope for thathe had no right
to hope for anything more now than a struggle with an inevitably fatal
ending to himself but one in which at least he could sell his life as
dearly as possible one in which perhaps he might pay the Tocsins
score with the man he had come to find If he could do thatwell after
all the price was not too great

There were no tremours of the muscles now It was Jimmie Dale the Gray
Seal every faculty alert tense keyed up to its highest efficiency
the brain cool keen and activefighting for his life The front door
through which he had entered was an impossibility but there was the
window in the library that he had openedif they would let him get that
far That was as good a chance as any If he made an effort to find
say a way to the flat above and chanced some means of escape there it
would in no wise obviate an attack upon him and he would only be under
the added disadvantage of unfamiliar surroundings

Feeling out with his left hand his automatic thrown a little forward
in his right he began to retrace his way along the blank wall of the
corridor pausing between each step to listen moving silently his
tread on the heavy carpet as noiseless as though it were some shadow
creeping there

Stillnessutter absolute Always that stillness Always that sense of
danger around himthe tense bated expectancy of momentary attacka
revolver flash through the darknessa sudden rush upon him But still
there was nothingonly the darkness only the silence

He gained the head of the stairs and began to descendand now the
strain began to tell upon his nerves again Again he was possessed of
the mad impulse to cry out to do anything that would force the issue
that would end the horrible unbearable suspense Why did that revolver
shot not come Why had they not yet rushed upon him Why were they
playing with him as a cat with a mouse Or was it all wild fanciful
imagination NO What was that again He could have sworn this time that
he had heard a sound but he could neither define its character nor
locate the direction from which it had come

He was at the foot of the stairs now and guiding himself by the wall
moving now barely an inch at a time he reached the library door that
he had left open and stole in over the threshold Halfway down the room
and diagonally across from where he stood was the window In a moment
now he could gain that but they would never let him go so easilyand
so it must come now in that next moment their attack Where were they
Where were they now The tablehe must remember not to bump into the
table A pause between each step he was crossing the room He was
halfway to the window Had it been all fancy was he toAnd then Jimmie
Dale stood motionless SOME ONE HAD CLOSED THE LIBRARY DOOR SOFTLY

Stillness again A sort of deadly calm upon him Jimmie Dale felt
out behind his back for the big library table that he had been
circuitingif the window were wide open it might be done but to jump
for it and stand silhouetted there during the pause necessary to fling
the window up was little less than suicidal He edged back noiselessly
until his fingers touched the table then lowering himself to his
knees he backed in underneath it and lay flat upon the floor It was
not much protection but it had one advantage if they switched on
the lights it would show an EMPTY room for the first instant and that
instant meantthe first shot

Where were they now By the library door How many of them were there
Well it was their move Two could play at cat and mouse untiluntil
DAYLIGHT That wasnt very far off now and when that came he might
still have the first shot but after thathe turned his head quickly
toward the window There was a faint scratching noise as of finger nails
gripping the sill then the window very slowly almost silently was
pushed steadily upward and a dark form loomed up outside and then
crawling through a man dropped as though his feet were padded like a
cats on the floor inside the room The Magpie

A flashlights ray shot outand with a twisted smile propped now
on his left elbow to give free play to his revolver arm Jimmie Dale
followed the white spot eagerly with his eyes But it did not circle
around instead the light was turned almost instantly toward the lower
end of the roomand a second later was holding steadily on the open
door of the safe and the litter of papers on the floor

Came a savage growl of amazed fury from the Magpie then his step
down the room and as he reached the safe a torrent of unbridled
blasphemyand then in a sort of staggered gasp as he leaned suddenly
forward examining the knob of the dial

The Gray Seal

A moment the Magpie stood there and then cursing again in abandon
turned and started back for the window his flashlight dancing before
himand stopped a snarl of fury on his lips The flashlight was
playing full on Jimmie Dale under the table

Larry the Bat The Gray Seal By God choked the Magpie Youyou
The Magpies flashlight as he shifted it from his right hand to his
left and wrenched out his revolver had fallen upon two men crouched
close against the wall by the library doorand he screamed out in an
access of fury De double cross A plant De bulls You damned snitch
Larry screamed out the Magpieand fired

The bullet tore into the carpet beside Jimmie Dale Came answering shots
from the men by the door and then the Magpie emptying his automatic at
the two men as he ran the flame tongues cutting vicious lanes of fire
through the darkness dashed for the window There was a cry the crash
of a heavy body pitching to the floorand the Magpie had flung himself
out through the window and in the momentary ensuing silence within the
room came the sound of his footsteps running on the gravel below

There was a low moan the movement as of some one staggering and
lurching aroundand then the lights went on But for an instant
Jimmie Dale did not move He was staring at the form of a man still and
motionless on the floor in front of himthe man who had posed as Henry
LaSalle Dead The man was dead His mind ran riot for a moment Where
were the otherswere there only these two Only these two in the house
Only these twoand one was dead And then Jimmie Dale was on his feet
One was deadbut there was still the other the man who was reeling
there back turned to him by the electriclight switch But even as
Jimmie Dale sprang forward this second man clawing at the wall for
support slipped to his knees and fell upon the carpet

Jimmie Dale reached him snatched the revolver from his hand and bent
over him It was the man whose name he did not know but whose face he
had reason enough to know too wellit was the leader of the Crime Club

The man though evidently badly wounded smiled defiantly in spite of
his pain

So youre the Gray Seal he flung out contemptuously A clever
enough safecrackerbut only a lowbrow like the rest of them Another
illusion dispelled Well youve got the moneybetter run hadnt you

Jimmie Dale made no answer Satisfied that the man was too badly hurt to
move he went and bent over the silent form in the centre of the room A
moments examination was enough Henry LaSalle was dead

He stood there looking down at the man It was what he had come
forthough it was the Magpie not himself who had accomplished it
The man was dead The words began to run through his mind in a queer
reiteration The man was deadthe man was dead He checked himself
sharply He must think nowthink fast and think RIGHT

The Magpie knew that Larry the Bat was the Gray Sealand as fast as the
Magpie could get there the news would spread like wildfire through the
underworld Death to the Gray Seal Death to the Gray Seal He could
hear that slogan ringing again in his ears but as he had never heard it
beforewith a snarl of triumph now as of wolves who at last had pulled
their quarry down He had not a second to spareand yetthat man
wounded there on the floor What of himguilty of murder the brains of
this inhuman monstrous organisation the one to whom more even than to
that dead man the Tocsin owed the horror and the misery and the grief
and despair that had come into her life What of him What of the Crime
Club here What of this nest of vipers Were they to escape Were they
to

With a sudden low exclamation Jimmie Dale jumped for the table and
snatching up the telephone rattled the hook violently

Give mehis voice came in wellsimulated gasps each like a man
fighting for every wordgive mepoliceheadquarters Quick QUICK
Ivebeenshot

The wounded man on the floor raised himself on his elbow

What are you doing he demanded in a startled way Are you mad Thank
your stars you were lucky enough to get out of this aliveand get out
now while you have the chance

Jimmie Dale pressed his hand firmly over the mouthpiece of the
telephone

Ill go he said with a cold smile when Ive settled with youfor
the murder of Henry LaSalle

That man ejaculated the man scornfully pointing to the form on the
floor So thats your game Going to try and cover your tracks Why
you fool I LIVE here Do you think the police would imagine for an
instant that I killed him

I saidHENRY LASALLE said Jimmie Dale evenly

The man came farther up on his elbow a sudden look of fear in his face

Whatwhat do you mean he cried hoarsely

But Jimmie Dale was talking again into the telephonegasping choking
out his words as before

Police headquarters Im Henry LaSalle Fifth Avenue IIve been
shot Take down this statement IllIll be dead before you get
hereIm not the real Henry LaSalle at all We murdered Henry
LaSallein Australia and murdered Peter LaSalle here Wewe tried
to kill the daughter but she ran away This house has been our
headquarters for the last five years The man who shot me tonight is
the leader of the gang We quarrelled over the division of a haul
Hes here on the floor now wounded Get them all get them all damn
themdo you hearget them all Theyre out of the house now but
lay a trap for them They always come in through the garage on the side
street Oh God Im done for Break down the west walls of the rooms
upstairsifyouwant proof of whatthe gangs been doing Hurry
Hurry ImImdone forI

Jimmie Dale permitted the telephone to drop with a clash from his hand
to the table

The face of the man on the floor was livid

Who are you In Gods name who are you he cried out wildly

Does it matter inquired Jimmie Dale grimly Your game is up Youll
go to the chair for the murder of Henry LaSalleif it is by proxy
Those rooms upstairs alone are enough to damn you to prove every word
of that dying confessionbut tomorrow added to it will come the
story of Marie LaSalle herself

For a moment the man hung there swaying on his elbow his face working
in ghastly fashionand then suddenly with a strange laugh he carried
one hand swiftly to his mouthand laughed againand before Jimmie Dale
could reach him was lifeless on the floor

A tiny vial rolled away upon the carpet Jimmie Dale picked it up A
drop or two of liquid still remained in itcolourless clear like
that liquid this same man had dropped into the rabbits mouth the night
before like the liquid in the glasses they had carried into that third
room like the liquid that his man had said was from a formula of their
own that was instantaneous in its action that defied detection by
autopsy

The set stern features of Jimmie Dale relaxed It was justicebut it
was also death In a surge of emotion the events of scarcely more
than twentyfour hours began to crowd upon himand then ominously
dominant above all else that slogan of the underworld Death to the
Gray Seal came ringing once more in his ears It brought him with a
startled movement of his hand across his eyes to a realisation of his
own desperate position Yes yes he must go The way was clear now for
the Tocsinclear now for her

He dropped the vial into his pocket and running to the safe quickly
scraped the gray seal from the dials knob then he drew the packages of
money from his shirt and pockets and tossed them on the floor among the
litter of papers already thereshe would get it back again when it had
served its purpose it would be selfevident that it was the proceeds of
that days sale of the estates securities over which the quarrel had
occurred

And now the window He ran to it closed it and LOCKED it then
laying the revolver he had taken from the leader down beside the man
he stepped across the room again and drew the body of Henry LaSalle
closer to the tableas though the man had fallen there when the
telephone had dropped from his hand

It was done now On the floor beside him lay each mans weaponand both
of the revolvers had been discharged several times Jimmie Dale paused
on the library threshold for a final survey of the room It was done
The way was clearfor her And now if he could only save himself There
was no chance for Larry the Bat Could he saveJIMMIE DALE

He crossed the hall a queer halfgrim halfwistful smile on his
lips unlocked the front door stepped out locked it behind himand
in another moment doubling around the corner was running along like a
hare along the side street



CHAPTER XVI

DEATH TO THE GRAY SEAL


On Jimmie Dale ran Across on Fourth Avenue he swung on a car that took
him to Astor Place Then striking east once more making a detour to
avoid the Bowery he ran on at top speed again To reach the Sanctuary
not before the Magpie should have spread the alarm that was impossible
but to reach it before the underworld should have had time to recover
its breath as it were before the underworld should have had time to
actthat was his only chance The Magpie had at the outside a start
of fifteen minutes but he Jimmie Dale had probably retrieved five
minutes of that in the time he had made in getting downtown That left
the Magpie ten to the good How long would it take the Magpie to bring
the underworld swarming like hornets around the Sanctuary

On Larry the Bat ran At the Sanctuary were the clothes the belongings
of Jimmie Dale Could he save Jimmie Dale If he could get there
change and get out again the way was clear for himas clear as for
the Tocsin now In a few hours the police would have every member of
the Crime Club in the trap there would be no watch any more around
his house on Riverside Drive and he would be free to return there
and resume his normal life as Jimmie Dale again if he could make
the Sanctuary in time But let the Magpie get there first let the
underworld tear the place to pieces in its fury as it would do let them
discover that hiding place under the flooring for instance and the
Gray Seal would not be merely Larry the Bat but Jimmie Dale as well
anda cry escaped him even as he ranit meant ruin the disgrace of
an honoured name death crimes without number at his door Crimes The
Gray Seal had never committed a crime But the crimes attributed to the
Gray Seal he could not disprove not one of them He had meant them
to appear as crimesand he had succeeded so well that the Gray Seals
name execrated was a synonym for the most callous dangerous and
unscrupulous criminal of the age

He was gasping for breath as finally making for the side door he
darted into the alleyway that flanked the Sanctuary What story would
the Magpie tell Not the truth of coursethat would let the Magpie in
for what had happened that night for the Magpie must be well aware
that he had shot at least one of the two men in that room But the
truth wasnt necessary it was foreign and had no bearing on the one
outstanding factthe Gray Seal was Larry the Bat At the present moment
the Magpie had a double incentive for getting the Gray Sealthe Gray
Seal was the only one who could prove murder against him that night
in the LaSalle mansion And afterwards when the police version of the
affair was made public the Magpie to save himself would be careful
enough to do or say nothing to contradict Henry LaSalles confession

Larry the Bat slipped in through the door halted there listened and
then began to mount the rickety stairs with his silent tread At the
top he paused again Nothingno sound They were not here yetso far
he was in time He stepped to the Sanctuary door unlocked it passed
into the squalid miserable room that had harboured him for so long as
Larry the Bat locked the door behind him crossed quickly to the window
to make sure that the shutters were closedand then for the first
time as the gray light streaked in through the interstices he was
conscious that it was already dawn So much the more need for haste
then

He whipped out his revolver and laid it at his hand on the dilapidated
table then the flooring in the corner was up in an instant and he
began to strip off the rags of Larry the Bat Boots mismated socks the
torn patched trousers the greasy flannel shirt the threadbare coat
the nondescript slouch hat were thrown in a pile on the floor and
with them from their hidingplace the grease paints and heterogeneous
collection of makeup accessories This done he began to slip on the
clothes of Jimmie Dale and when half dressed turned to the table
again to remove the characteristic grime stain and paint of Larry the
Bat from face hands wrists throat and neck This was a longer more
arduous task He reached for the cracked pitcher to pour more water into
the basinand snatching up his revolver instead whirled to face the
door

Some one was outside He had caught the creak of a footstep upon the
stairs In a flash he was across the room and crouched by the door Yes
the step was nearer nowat the head of the stairson the landing His
revolver lifted holding a steady bead on the door panel And then there
came a low voice

Jimmie Jimmie Are you there Quick Jimmie Are you there

The Tocsin What was she doing here Why had he not warned her up there
on the avenue fool that he was that of all places she was to keep away
from here

She slipped into the room as he unlocked the door

Theyre coming Jimmie she panted breathlessly Theres not an
instant to lose Listen When the Magpie ran from the house I ran with
himbut itshe tried to smileit wasnt to obey you to run awayI
had made up my mind I wouldnt do thatit was to find out from him what
had happened He told me you were the Gray Seal He did not suspect me
He thinks you were no more than just Larry the Bat to me as you were
to everybody else He went straight to Chicago Ikes gambling rooms and
found the Skeeters gang thereyou know them Red Mose the Midget
Harve Thoms and the Skeeteryou remember your fight with them over
old Luddys diamonds Well they have not forgotten either They are on
their way here now The news that you are the Gray Seal is travelling
like lightning all through the underworldthere will be a mob here on
the Skeeters heels So Jimmiequick Run

Run Half Larry the Bat half Jimmie Daleand run In another five
minutes perhapsyes But there probably would not be five minutesand
sheif she were found here

Yes he said quietly Ill get away in a moment You go at once
Illhe was smiling at her reassuringlyIll meet you at

She looked at him then for an instantinterrupting him quickly as she
shook her head

I didnt notice Jimmie You cannot go like thatcan you It would
be even worse than being caught as Larry the Bat Hurry thenI am not
going without you

No he said Go now Go at once Mariewhile you can You have
risked your life as it is to come here and tell me this For Gods sake
go now

The great brown eyes were smiling bravely through a sudden mist She
shook her head again

Not without you Jimmie

It brought a fierce wild throb of joy upon himand then a cold
sickening fear

Listen he cried out desperately You must go now You cannot take
any chances now Marie Everything is right for you That man who posed
as your uncle is deadthe leader of the Crime Club is dead Dont you
understand what that means You have only to be Marie LaSalle again and
claim your own I cannot tell you all nowtheres no time That house
was the Crime Club itself The police will get them all Dont you see
Dont you see Everything is clear for you nowand now go Goyou must
go

She was staring at him a strange wonder in her face

Clear All clearfor me II can go back toto my own life again
It was as though she were whispering some amazing thing of unbelievable
joy to herself

YES he cried out again Yes But gogo Marie

But now for answer suddenly she reached out and took the key from the
door and put it in the pocket of her dress

We will go together Jimmieor not at all she said simply We are
wasting precious moments Hurry and dress

He hesitated miserably What could he doif she WOULD not go And it
was truethe moments were flying Better rather than futile argument
to use them as she said There was still a chance Why not Five
minutes He could do better than that He MUST do better than that

Without a word he ran back across the room In frantic haste from
face hands wrists and neck came the stain There was still time She
was standing there by the door listening She the Tocsin she whom
he loved she who all through the years that had gone had been so
strangely elusive and yet so intimately a part of his life SHE was
standing there now here with himin peril with every second that
passed

He had only to slip on his coat and vest nowand make a bundle of
Larry the Bats things on the floor so that he could carry them away
to destroy them He stooped to gather up the clothesand straightened
suddenlyand jumped toward the door again

They are coming Jimmie she called in a low voice But he had
already heard themthe stairs were creaking loudly under the tread of
many feet He pushed the Tocsin hurriedly back against the wall at the
side of the door

Stand there he said under his breath Out of the line of fire
Dont move

There was a rush against the doorand then a voice growled

Aw cut dat out Wot do youse want to doscare him away by bustin it
Pick de lock an well lay for him inside till he shows up

It was the Skeeters voice The Skeeter and his gangthe worst apaches
in the city of New York Professional assassins death contractors
he had called themand the lowest bidders A mans life any time for
twentyfive dollars No they were not likely to forget the affair of
the pushcart man to forget old Luddy and his diamonds to forgetthe
Gray Seal And they were only the vanguard of what was to come

Some one was working at the lock now There was one way to stop that It
would not take them long to find out that he WAS there once the door
was opened Better know it with the door SHUT Jimmie Dale lifted his
revolver coolly and fired through the panel

A burst of yells answered the shot and among them high above the
others the Magpies scream

We got him We got him Hes dere now

And then it seemed that pandemonium broke loosethere was a volley of
shots the bullets splintering through the door panels as from a machine
gun so fast they cameand then another rush against the door

Flat on the floor but well back and to one side Jimmie Dale fired
steadilyagain and again

Came screams of pain yells and oathsand they fell back from the
door

And now from above from overhead came tumultwindows thrown up the
stamp of feet cries of fright And from the street a low sullen roar
The underworld was gathering fast

Once more the rush upon the doorand Jimmie Dale a grim twisted smile
upon his lips emptied his revolver into the panels Once more they
fell backand then there came the Skeeters voice snarling like an
infuriated beast

Hell get de lot of us like dis Cut it out Besides well have de
bulls down here in a minutean hes OUR meat not theirs Deyd be
too damned soft wid himdeyd only send him to de chair Youse chase
upstairs Mose an pass de word to beat itan beat it quick Well
BURN de skunk outdats wot An de bulls can stand alongside an
watch if dey likesbut hes our meat

Jimmie Dale did not dare to look at the Tocsins face Mechanically he
refilled the magazine of his automaticand lay there waiting The roar
from the street grew louder They seemed to be fighting out there as
though an inadequate number of police were trying to disperse a moband
not succeeding Pretty soon with the riot call in there would probably
be a battlefor the Gray Seal Sublime irony It was death at the hands
of either one

Children whimpered on the stairs outside men swore women cried feet
shuffled hurriedly by as the tenement emptied Occasionally a pertinent
invitation to him to remain where he was there was a vicious rip
through the panel and the drumming whir of a bullet flying through the
room And then a curious ominous crackling soundand then the smell of
smoke

Jimmie Dale stood up his face drawn and haggard The tenement would go
like matchwood burn like a bonfire with any kind of a startand there
was no doubt about the start The Skeeter the Magpie and the rest
would have seen that it had headway enough to serve their purpose before
either firemen or police could thwart them He Jimmie Dale could
take his choice walk out into a bullet or stay there andhe smiled
miserably as his eyes fell upon the pile of Larry the Bats clothing on
the floor There was no longer need to worry about ITS destructionthe
fire would take care of that only too well And then a low bitter
cry came to his lips and he clenched his hands If it were only
himselfonly himself He crossed to the Tocsin and caught her in his
arms

Oh my GodMarie he faltered

The cape and hood had fallen from her and with the hood had fallen the
graystreaked hair of Silver Magand now as she smiled at him it was
from a face that was very beautiful and very brave and very full of
tenderness

And he held her thereand neither spoke

It seeped in under the threshold of the door it came from everywhere
filling the roomthe black strangling smoke Outside in the hall all
was silence nowsave for that crackle of flame that grew in volume
that came now in quick sharp reports like revolver shots From out in
the street swelled a cry Death to the Gray Seal Then the clang of
bells the roar and rattle of fire apparatus strident voices bellowing
orders and the crowd again blood hungry Death to the Gray Seal

There was a chance just oneif the fire had no headway along the upper
end of the landingand if they had not thought to set a watch for
him ABOVE Theythe Magpie the Skeeter and his gangmust have been
driven even out of the house now by the smoke and flame

Give me the key I am going to open the door Marie he said quietly
Cover your face with a handkerchief anything and run to the LEFT to
the next flight of stairs There are two flats above thiswell make
the roof if we can Noware you ready

It was an instant before she answered an instant in which she lifted
her face to his and held his face between her two handsand then

I am ready Jimmie

He flung open the door his arm around her to help her forwardand
instinctively with a cry fell back for a moment With the inrush of
the draft poured the smoke and through it lurid yellow showed the
flames leaping from the stair well

And then all was blind madness Together they ran At the foot of the
stairs she fell recovered herself staggered up anotherand fell
again He caught her up in his arms and staggering now as she had
staggered went on His lungs seemed to be bursting His limbs grew
weak and trembled under him He could not see or breathe The nauseating
fumes suffocated him bringing an intolerable agony He gained the first
landing above There was one moreone more If he could only rest here
for a moment Yes that was itrest It wasnt so bad here now She
stirred in his arms struggled to her feetand he was helping her on
again and up the next flight of stairs

And suddenly he found himself laughing in hysteriafor they were
climbing a half stair half ladderway at the end of the upper landing
and the open skylight was above them and they were drinking in the
pure fresh airand now they were out upon the roof and the roar from
the street was in their ears like the roar of great waters from some
canyon far below Jimmie Dale tried to speak and found his lips were
cracked and dry He wet them with his tongue

Dont stand upwed be seenCRAWL he mumbled hoarsely

It took a long timeover one roof and then another and yet
anotherand then through the skylight of a tenement whose occupants
were either craning from the front windows or were on the street below
It was perhaps half an hourand then they too were standing in the
street and all about them the crowd was shouting in wild excitement

Up the block inside the fire lines the Sanctuary was blazing
furiouslyand now suddenly the wall seemed to bulge outward It brought
a yell from the crowd

Death to the Gray Seal

She pulled at his arm

Let us get away Let us get away Jimmie she whispered frantically

A strange smile was on Jimmie Dales lips

Were safe nowfor always he whispered back Look

The Sanctuary wall bulged farther outward seemed to hang an instant
hesitant in midairand fell with a mighty crash

The Gray Seal was dead
