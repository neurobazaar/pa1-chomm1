We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtytwo text
files per month or 384 more Etexts in 1997 for a total of 1000
If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 100 billion Etexts given away

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31 2001 10000 x 100000000Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 10 of the present number of computer users 2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that so it
will require us reaching less than 5 of the users in 2001

INTRODUCTION


It is not proposed in these preliminary remarks to sketch in
detail the origin and growth of the Historical Novel this has
already been amply done by Professor Saintsbury and others I
shall be content to approach the subject on its general side
offering at the same time some critical suggestions which will I
hope not be without value to readers of Romance

But first of all I must explain how the List which follows came
to be compiled and the object I have in offering it For many
years I have been an assiduous reader of novels and tales in which
the historical element appeared supplementing my own reading in
this direction by a careful study of all that I could find in the
way of Criticism on such works and their writers Only in this way
could I venture on a selection involving a survey of several
thousand volumes With the above understanding I can say that no
book has been inserted without some reason while I have made all
possible effort to obtain accuracy of description And this leads
me to remark that just in this process of selection do I claim
originality for my List Nearly twenty years ago an excellent
Descriptive Catalogue of Historical Novels and Tales was
published Mr H Courthope Bowen was the compiler and I would
here mention my indebtedness to him In Mr Bowens list however
one finds good and bad alikeall the works of even such moderately
endowed writers as G P R James Ainsworth Grant etc are
there set down It seemed to me that not only was there room for
a new list of Historical Novels Stevenson Marion Crawford Conan
Doyle Weyman Mason and a number of more or less capable
romancists having come forward in the last twenty years but
also that more than ever was there a need for some sort of clue in
the search for such books In the last year or two there has been
an almost alarming influx in this department of Fiction and
teachers in schools besides readers in general may be glad to be
saved a somewhat tedious investigation


 A Descriptive Catalogue of Historical Novels and Tales for the
use of School Libraries and Teachers of History compiled and
described by H Courthope Bowen M A Edward Stanford 1882


Having thus attempted to justify the existence of my little
Guide I pass on to deal with the subject of Historical Fiction
itself Most of us I suppose at one time or another have
experienced a thrill of interest when some prominent personage
whom we knew well by repute came before us in the flesh We
watched his manner and noted all those shades of expression which
in anothers countenance we should have passed by unheeded Well
it seems to me that parallel with this experience is that which
we gain when reading some firstrank romance we encounter in its
pages a figure with which History has made us more or less
familiar And I would remark that the great masters do not as a
rule make that mistake which less skilful writers fall intothe
mistake of introducing wellknown historical figures too
frequently The Cromwell of Woodstock has an element of mystery
about him even while he stands out before our mental vision in
bold relief Had Scott brought him more prominently into the plot
and thus emphasized the fictional aspect of his figure our
interest in the story as such might have been sustained but we
should have lost that atmosphere of vraisemblance which under a
more careful reserve the hand of the master has wrought for us

But it is not only this introduction of personalities which
constitutes a novel historical the mere allusion to real events
or the introduction of dates may give us sufficient ground for
identifying the period with which a novel deals Of course the
question as to whether a particular person or event is truly
historical is not always an easy one to answer By the adaptation
in it of some purely mythical character or event a novel is no
more constituted historical than is a Fairytale by the
adaptation of folklore King Arthur and Robin Hood are
unhistorical and if I have ventured to insert in my list certain
tales which deal with the latter it is not on that account but
because other figures truly historical eg Richard I appear
As there has been some dispute on this question of the Historical
Novel proper I offer the following definitionA Novel is
rendered Historical by the introduction of dates personages or
events to which identification can be readily given I am quite
aware that certain wellknown novels which give the general
atmosphere of a periodsuch for example as Hawthornes Scarlet
Letter and Mr Hewletts Forest Loversdo not come within the
scope of my definition but this is just why I have added a
Supplementary List of semihistorical tales And while I am
alluding to this Supplementary List I should like to give my
reason for omitting from it one remarkable book which has every
claim to be considered representative of the midnineteenth
century Readers of John Inglesant may be reminded that in his
interesting preface Mr Shorthouse alludes to William Smiths
philosophical novelThorndale As a picture of Thought
developments in the early Victorian period the latter work has
special historical interest for the philosophical and theological
student in this respect it may be likened to Paters Marius the
Epicurean which vividly reproduces the Intellectual ferment of an
earlier age Thorndale however is primarily didactic and the
philosophical dialogues interesting as these are to the
metaphysician hardly atone to the general reader for an almost
entire absence of plot The above is doubtless an altogether
extreme instance but the exclusion of several other works from the
category of Romance seems to follow on something like the same
grounds Beckers Charicles and Gallus are little more than
school textbooks while turning to a less scholarly quarter
Ainsworths Preston Fight and even his betterknown Guy
Fawkes may be cited as illustrating what Mr Shorthouse means
when he speaks of novels in which a small amount of fiction has
been introduced simply for the purpose of relating History In
all such cases the average novelreader feels that he has been
allured on false pretences I am well aware that not a few of the
books included in my List might be considered to fall under the
same ban but I think it will be found that in most of them there
is at least a fair attempt to arouse narrative interest

Coming to the List itself it will be noticed that I have been
somewhat sparing in the books given under the PreChristian
heading Novels dealing with these very faroff times are apt to
be unsatisfactory the mist in which events and personages are
enveloped takes away from that appearance of reality which is the
great charm of the historical novel We are hardly concerned in
reading Sarchedon and similar books to get away from the purely
imaginary pictures which spring from the Novelists own brain and
the danger is that the very elements which add to our interest in
the tale as such will go far to mislead us in our conception of
the period dealt with There is none of that sense of familiarity
which we enjoy when reading a sixteenth or seventeenth century
romance in the latter case the historical background being
easily perceptible merges for us with the creations of the
authors own imagination Where the writer of an ancient romance
happens to be a scholar like Ebers we feel thatso far at least
as historical presentment goeswe cannot be far wrong but the
combination of great scholarship and narrative capacity is alas
too rare

I have likewise refrained from giving many tales dealing with
EarlyChristian times We are here it must be admitted on
controversial ground and under the First Century heading I have
endeavoured to insert romances of the highest quality only For
instance I think that Dr Abbotts Philochristus and Wallaces
Ben Hur ought to satisfy two different types of readers And
this is the place doubtless to say that in my lists will be found
books of widely differing merit and aim School teachers and
others in like capacity will easily discriminate between authors
suitable for juvenile or untrained tastes and authors whose appeal
is specially to those of maturer thought and experience Differing
as much in method and style as in choice of period and character
type Thackerays Vanity Fair and George Eliots Romola have at
least this in commonthey require a very high degree of
intelligence for their due appreciation Who among those of us
with any knowledge of such works would dream of recommending them
to a youthful reader fresh from the perusal of Miss Yonges Little
Duke or Captain Marryatts Children of the New Forest

Naturally in a list of this kind there is bound to be very great
inequality certain periods have been wholly ignored by writers of
the first rank while in others we have something like an embarras
de richesse Consequently I have been compelled here and there
to insert authors of only mediocre merit In other cases again I
have not hesitated to omit works by writers of acknowledged
position when these have seemed below the authors usual standard
and where no gap had to be filled I would instance the James II
William III period Here Stanley Weyman and Edna Lyall might
have been represented but there being no dearth of good novels
dealing with both the above reigns I did not deem it advisable to
call in these popular writers at the point which has been very
generally considered their lowest I mention this to show that
omissions do not necessarily mean ignorance though in covering
such an immense ground I cannot doubt that romances worthy of a
place in my list have been overlooked

I think many will be surprised to find how large a proportion of
our best writers English and American have entered the domain of
Historical or SemiHistorical Romance Scott Thackeray Dickens
George Eliot Charlotte Bronte George Meredith R L Stevenson
Hawthorne Peacock Charles Kingsley Henry Kingsley Charles
Reade Anthony Trollope Mrs Gaskell Walter Besant Lytton

few of the names which appear in the following pages while

Auerbach Manzoni Perez Galdos Merejkowski Topelius
Sienkiewicz and Jokai are perhaps the chief amongst those
representing Literatures other than our own

these mere titles arouse within many of us And though most of
the books given in my list cannot be described in the same glowing
terms as the masterpieces just named yet many nests of pleasant
thoughts may be formed through their companionship

Hitherto allusion has been mainly in the direction of modern
authors and I would now say a word or two in regard to those of an
earlier period who are also represented Defoe Fielding
Richardson Goldsmith Smollett Frances Burney Samuel Lover John
Galt Maria Edgeworth Susan Ferrier William Godwin Mary Shelley
Fennimore Cooper J G Lockhart Leigh Hunt Thos Moore Harriet
Martineau J L Motley Horace Smith Charles Lever Meadows
Taylor and Wm Carletonthese in greater or less degree
notable names were bound to have a place and coming to less
distinguished writers I may mention the brothers Banim Gerald
Griffin Mrs S C Hall Lady Morgan the sisters Porter W G
Simms George Croly Albert Smith G R Gleig W H Maxwell Sir
Arthur Helps Eliot Warburton Lewis Wingfield Thomas Miller C
Macfarlane Grace Aguilar Anne Manning and Emma Robinson author
of Whitefriars To G P R James Harrison Ainsworth and
James Grant I have previously alluded It has been my endeavour to
choose the best examples of all the abovenamed novelistsa task
rendered specially difficult in some cases by the fact of immense
literary output Doubtless not a few of the works so chosen are
open to criticism but they will at least serve to illustrate
certain stages in the growth of Historical Romance With the
exclusion of Mrs Radcliffe Mrs Marsh Mrs Gore Lady
Blessington Lady Fullerton Mrs Bray and Mrs Child few will I
imagine find fault but writers like Miss Tucker A L O E and
Miss Emily Holt still find so many readers in juvenile quarters
that it has required a certain amount of courage to place them also
on my Index Expurgatorius Turning once again to writers of the
sterner sex I have ruled out C R Maturin G W M Reynolds and
Pierce Egan Junr and quitting the sensational for the mildly
entertaining out of the Rev J M Neales many historical tales
I have selected only oneTheodora Phranza which besides being
well written has the merit of dealing with a somewhat neglected
period Stories possessing a background of History are to be found
in Tales from Blackwood as also in Wilsons Tales of the
Borders but their extremely slight character seemed scarcely to
justify insertion while not even the high literary position
attained by him on other grounds reconciled me to either of Allan
Cunninghams novelsSir Michael Scott and Paul Jones

Of the Foreign novelists appearing in my list several have been
already named but Marchese DAzeglio F D Guerrazzi Cesare
Cantu W Alexis G Haring H Laube Louise Mulbach Klara M
Mundt Nicolas Josika Viktor Rydberg Hendrik Conscience Xavier
B Saintine Amedee Achard and ErckmannChatrian here call for
notice as not coming under strictly Contemporary classification I
would forestall the criticism that two writers have been passed
over whose fame is greater than any of those just mentioned viz
Stendhal Henri Beyle and Alphonse Daudet Beyles La
Chartreuse de Parme though containing the oftpraised account of
Waterloo is far more Psychological than Historical and Daudets
Robert Helmont while it depicts under Diary form certain
aspects of the FrancoGerman War has hardly any plot running
through it As the Waterloo and FrancoGerman War periods were
amply illustrated in numerous other novels of more assured
suitability I had the less hesitation in deciding against the two
works just named In the selections from Foreign Historical
Fiction nothing more has been attempted than to include the leading
examples most of these it will be found have been translated
into English

Before leaving the subject of older writers it may be mentioned
that not a few of the works chosen to represent them are at the
moment out of print To anyone objecting that something ought to
have been done to indicate this in each separate case I would urge
that the out of print line can never be drawn with precision in
view of constant reprints as well as of further extinctions

Perhaps this introduction may be most fitly concluded by something
in the nature of apology for Historical Romance itself Not only
has fault been found with the deficiencies of unskilled authors in
that department but the question has been asked by one or two
critics of standingWhat right has the Historical Novel to exist
at all More often than not it is pointed out the Romancist
gives us a mass of inaccuracies which while they mislead the
ignorant ie the majority are an unpardonable offence to the
historicallyminded reader Moreover the writer of such Fiction
though he be a Thackeray or a Scott cannot surmount barriers which
are not merely hard to scale but absolutely impassable The
spirit of a period is like the selfhood of a human beingsomething
that cannot be handed on try as we may it is impossible for us to
breathe the atmosphere of a bygone time since all those thousand
andone details which went to the building up of both individual
and general experience can never be reproduced We consider say
the Eighteenth Century from the purely Historical standpoint and
while we do so are under no delusion as to our limitations we
know that a few of the leading personages and events have been
brought before us in a more or less disjointed fashion and are
perfectly aware that there is room for much discrepancy between the
pictures so presented to us be it with immense skill and the
actual facts as they took place in such and such a year But goes
on the objector in the case of a Historical Romance we allow
ourselves to be hoodwinked for under the influence of a pseudo
historic security we seem to watch the real sequence of events in
so far as these affect the characters in whom we are interested
How we seem to live in those early years of the Eighteenth Century
as we follow Henry Esmond from point to point and yet in truth
we are breathing not the atmosphere of Addison and Steele but the
atmosphere created by the brilliant Nineteenth Century Novelist
partly out of his erudite conception of a former period and partly
out of the emotions and thoughts engendered by that very
environment which was his own and from which he could not escape

Well to all such criticisms it seems to me there are ample
rejoinders In the first place it must be remembered that History
itself possesses interest for us more as the unfolding of certain
moral and mental developments than as the mere enumeration of
facts Of course I am aware that the ideal of the Historian is
Truth utterly regardless of prejudice and inclination but as with
all other human ideals this one is never fully realised and there
is ever that discrepancy between Fact and its Narration to which I
just now alluded This being so I would askIs not the writer of
Fiction justified in emphasising those elements of History which
have a bearing on life and character in general There is
doubtless a wise and an unwise method of procedure One novelist
in the very effort to be accurate produces a work whichbeing
neither History nor Fictionis simply dull while another who has
gauged the true relation between fact and imagination knows better
than to bring into prominence that which should remain only as a
background After all there are certain root motives and
principles which though they vary indefinitely in their
application underlie Human Conduct and are common to all ages
alike Given a fairly accurate knowledge as regards the general
history of any period combined with some investigation into its
special manners and customs there is no reason why a truly
imaginative novelist should not produce a work at once satisfying
to romantic and historical instincts

Again if it be true that the novelist cannot reproduce the far
past in any strict sense it is also true that neither can he so
reproduce the life and events of yesterday That power of
imaginative memory which all exercise in daily experience may be
held in very different degrees but its enjoyment is not dependent
on accuracy of representationfor were this so none of us would
possess it In an analogous manner the writer of Romance may be
more or less adequately equipped on the side of History pure and
simple but he need not wait for that which will never comethe
power of reproducing in toto a past age If in reading what
purports to be no more than a Novel the struggle between
Christianity and Paganism for example or the unbounded egotism
of Napoleon be brought more vividly before our mindsand this may
be done by suggestion as well as by exact relation then I would
maintain we are to some extent educated historically using the
word in a large though perfectly legitimate sense

I recently read a work which here presents itself as admirably
illustrating my meaning In her too little known Adventures of a
Goldsmith Miss M H Bourchier has contrived to bring forcibly
before us the period when Napoleon fast approaching the zenith of
his power was known in France as the First Consul The man of
destiny himselfappearing on the scene for little more than a
brief momentcan in no sense be described as one of the books
characters and yet the whole plot is so skilfully contrived as to
hinge on his personality We are made to feel the dominating
influence of that powerful will upon the fears and hopes of a time
brimming over with revolutionary movement Whether the Chouan
revolt is in this particular story accurately depicted for us in
all its phases or whether the motives which impelled certain
public characters are therein interpreted arightboth in regard to
these and other points there may be room for doubt but at least
the general forces of the period are placed before us in such a way
as to drive home the conviction that be the historical
inaccuracies of detail what they may in the eyes of this or that
specialist the picture as a whole is one which while it rivets
our attention as lovers of romance does no injury to the strictest
Historic sense

I know well that numerous novels might be cited which besides
abounding in anachronisms are harmful in that they present us with
a misleading conception of some personality or period moreover I
acknowledge that this defect is by no means confined to romances of
an inferior literary order That Cromwell has been unreasonably
vilified and Mary Queen of Scots misconceived as a saintly martyr
how often are these charges brought against not a few of our
leading exponents of Historical Fiction Let this be fully
granted it remains to askTo whom were our novelists originally
indebted for these misconceptions Were not the historians of an
earlier generation responsible for these wrong judgments True
the real Science of Historythe sifting of evidence and the
discovery and unravelling of ancient documentsmay be described as
an essentially modern attainment so it would be unreasonable to
blame our older historians for errors which it was largely if not
wholly beyond their power to overcome And it is just here that I
would emphasise my defence of the Romancist If Historians
themselves have differed and still differ may it not be pleaded
on behalf of the Historical Novelist that he also must be judged
according to the possibilities of his time For while he may have
too readily adopted false conceptions in the past there is no
necessity why in the future he alsoprofiting by the growth of
Critical investigationshould not have due regard in the working
out of his Historical background for all the latest results
And I would further add even though it be true that Scott and
others have misled us in certain directions this does not prevent
our acknowledgment that given their aspect of a particular period
it was only fitting that the scheme of their novels should be in
harmony with it If Bloody Mary was a cruel hypocrite then our
reading of her period will be influenced by that real or supposed
fact but if further investigation reverses this severe judgment
on the woman herself then in Heavens name let us mould our
general conception afresh The fountains of Romance show no sign
of running dry and though we may look in vain at the moment for a
genius of the very highest type the Future has possibilities
within it which the greatest literary pessimist among us cannot
wholly deny If then fault can be found with the older
Romancists for the spreading here and there of false historical
notions let us look to future workers in the same sphere for
adjustment I believe however that one notable critic has
pronounced the mischief already done to be quite irreparable
seeing that the only History at all widely spread is that derived
from those very romances in which errors are so interwoven with the
sentimental interest of the plot itself that readers inevitably
hug their delusions But I think that this danger need not be
contemplated seriously The Historical Novel exists primarily as
Fiction and even though in our waking moments we may be persuaded
of the unreality of that dream which a Scott or a Dumas has
produced for us we shall still be able to place ourselves again
and again under the spell of their delightful influence Moreover
while admitting Dumas carelessness of exact detail it would
hardly be contended by the most sceptical that his works still
less those of Scott are without any background of Historic
suggestiveness Scott indeed shows signs of having possessed
something of that detachment which is one important qualification
in the Historian proper there is a fairness and prevision in his
historical judgments which we look for in vain when reading the
works of his contemporaries

And having thus touched on what I believe to be the true relation
between Romance and History I may note as a last word the use of
the Historical Tale to those who have the training of young folk
That desire to know which is an essential for all true learning
is sometimes best fostered by methods outside the ordinary School
routine Thus as regards History where the textbook fails in
arousing interest the tale may succeed and once the spirit of
inquiry has been stimulated half the battle is gained In saying
this I am far from wishing to imply that the reading of romances
can ever take the place of genuine historical study I know well
that such a book as Greens Short History of the English People
may prove to some more fascinating than any novel There are
however cases in which recourse may be had to a highclass work of
fiction for the attainment of a truer historic sense while taken
only as supplement to more strictly Academic reading such a work
may prove to have its uses Considerable discrimination is
requiredas I have already hintedin the choice of suitable
books and as a help in this direction I have made out vide
Suggested courses of Reading at the end of this volume two
special lists for Boys and Girls respectively which will I trust
be found useful If besides being of help to teachers my
recommendations should lead in any degree to further appreciation
of the great masters of Romance the labour by no means
inconsiderable expended on this little compilation will be amply
rewarded

 SUPPLEMENTARY LIST OF NOTABLE NOVELS

Which while not strictly Historical in some way represent
bygone periods


 Nothing like exhaustiveness is claimed for this Supplementary
List the method of study therein indicated might be indefinitely
extended but the few works given form an almost necessary
startingpoint A less restricted list would of course include
the SemiHistoric examples of such Foreign authors as Madame de

primarily in the direction of Historical Romance proper I have

SUGGESTED COURSES OF READINGJUVENILE


As likely to assist Parents and Teachers I propose to give two
lists covering English History from the Norman Conquest for Boys
and Girls respectively but a passing allusion may first of all
be made to tales dealing with more ancient periods For the
illustration of Greek and Roman History those books of Professor
A J Church which are entered in my PreChristian section may be
safely recommended while the pictures of First Century life given
in Wallaces Ben Hur Lyttons Last Days of Pompeii and Whyte
Melvilles The Gladiators are perhaps as likely to interest an
intelligent boy or girl in the teen stage as any similar
productions that could be mentioned Turning to the Early History
of our own isle I would specially mention Mr Hentys Beric the
Briton the Aescendune series of tales Edwy the Fair Alfgar
the Dane and The Rival Heirs by the late Rev A D Crake Mr
C W Whistlers Havelok the Dane A Thane of Wessex c and
the various books chosen to represent Alfred and his times

In preparing the following lists I have had in view for the most
part the average Juvenile taste doubtless many of the more
advanced works might be offered in special cases but in regard to
that the Parent or Teacher can alone judge Some of the tales
entered in I reappear in II but a comparison will disclose
important differences A reference to the General List will in
most cases reveal a more exact specification for the sake of
convenience the tales are here grouped according to Reigns only

Of the romances dealing with American and Foreign History to be
found in the foregoing pages many are suitable for young readers
but the sequence not being very close for any lengthy period at
least separate lists would appear superfluous Such writers to
mention only a few as Fennimore Cooper Mrs J G Austin G C
Eggleston Kirk Munroe and Elbridge S Brooks may be particularly
recommended for American History while Scott Dumas Charlotte M
Yonge Miss Roberts author of Mademoiselle Mori and G A
Henty have all illustratedin more or less adequate fashionthe
course of events in Foreign Countries The novels of Dumas are not
infrequently considered somewhat strong meat but his  She
Wolves of Machecoul and Black Tulip may be safely placed in any
hands

In connection with this subject of Juvenile Literature I would
draw attention to Messrs Constables Library of Historical Novels
and Romancesso admirably edited by Mr G Laurence Gomme
Readers old as well as young are still further indebted to Mr
Gomme for his wellarranged series of extracts taken from Romantic
Literature in the four volumes entitled The Kings Story Book
The Queens Story Book The Princes Story Book and The
Princesss Story Book Constable  Co




BIBLIOGRAPHY


Although I have adopted the heading Bibliography it should be
understood that in offering the subjoined list I do not claim for
it absolute comprehensiveness There are of course almost
innumerable Biographies Literary Studies Histories of Literature
and Fiction c in which indirect references to our subject may
be traced Moreover in preparing this little volume it has been
found necessary to consult largely The Dictionary of National
Biography the Enyclopaedias especially Chambers 1901 and
other Standard Works of the Dictionary type I confine myself
below to noteworthy writings which deal directly with the subject
of Historical Romance

Article on The American Historical Novel by Paul Lester Ford in
The Atlantic Monthly December 1897

In this article a definition of the Historical Novel at variance
with my own has been suggested In spite of Mr Fords argument I
am still of opinion that the line of demarcation between the
Historical Novel proper and the Novel of Character or Adventure can
be more clearly drawn than he allows I was careful when dealing
with this question in my Introduction to avoid making the test one
of actual historical accuracy but there are I have implied
certain readilyverifiable personages and events which form a basis
amply sufficient for purposes of distinction The pirates of
Treasure Island are taken as Mr Ford says from actual figures
of the Eighteenth Century but under my definition Stevensons
novel is not thereby constituted historical in the strict sense

attitude is surely unfavourable to History itself which is
always more than any mere statement of facts

contain a section devoted to Historical Romance
