THE EPISODE OF THE DARKENED ROOM



CHAPTER I


 What shall we say when DreamPictures leave their frames of
 night and push us from the waking world

As the part I played in the events I am about to narrate was rather that
of a passive observer than of an active participant I need say little
of myself I am a graduate of a Western university and by profession
a physician My practice is now extensive owing to my blundering into
fame in a somewhat singular manner but a year ago I had I assure
you little enough to do Inasmuch as my practice is now secure I feel
perfectly free to confess that the cure I effected in the now celebrated
case of Mrs P was altogether the result of chance and not as I was
then only too glad to have people believe due to an almost supernatural
power of diagnosis

Mrs P was not more surprised at the happy result than was I the only
difference being that she showed her astonishment while I endeavoured
to conceal mine and affected to look upon the whole thing as a matter
of course

My fame spread the case got into the medical journals where my skill
was much lauded and my practice became enormous There is but one thing
further I need mention regarding myself that is that I am possessed
of a memory which my friends are pleased to consider phenomenal I can
repeat a lecture sermon or conversation almost word for word after
once hearing it provided always that the subject commands my interest
My humble abilities in this direction have never ceased to be a source
of wonderment to my acquaintance though I confess for my own part
when I compare them with those of Blind Tom or of the man who after a
single reading could correctly repeat the London Times advertisements
and all they seem modest indeed

It was about the time when owing to the blessed Mrs P my creditors
were beginning to receive some attention that I first met George
Maitland He had need he said of my professional services he felt
much under the weather could I give him something which would brace him
up a bit he had some important chemical work on hand which he could
not afford to put by in fact he didnt mind saying that he was at work
upon a table of atomical pitches to match Daltons atomic weights if he
succeeded in what he had undertaken he would have solved the secret of
the love and hatred of atoms and unions hitherto unknown could easily
be effected

I do not know how long he would have continued had not my interest
in the subject caused me to interrupt him I was something of an
experimenter myself and here was a man who could help me

It was a dream of mine that the great majority of ailments could be
cured by analysing a patients blood and then injecting into his veins
such chemicals as were found wanting or were necessary to counteract
the influence of any deleterious matter present There were of course
difficulties in the way but had they not already at Cornell University
done much the same for vegetable life And did not those plants which
had been set in sea sand out of which every particle of nutriment had
been roasted and which were then artificially fed with a solution of
the chemicals of which they were known to be composed grow twice as
rank as those which had been set in the soil ordinarily supposed to be
best adapted to them What was the difference between a human cell and
a plant cell Yes since my patient was a chemist I would cultivate his
acquaintance

He proceeded to tell me how he felt but I could make nothing of it so
I forthwith did the regulation thing what should we doctors do without
it I looked at his tongue pulled down his eyelid and pronounced
him bilious Yes there were the little brown spots under his
skinfreckles perhapsand probably he had an occasional ringing in
his ears He was willing to admit that he was dizzy on suddenly rising
from a stooping posture and that eggs milk and coffee were poison to
him and he afterward told me he should have said the same of any
other three articles I might have mentioned for he looked so hale
and vigorous and felt so disgracefully well that he was ashamed of
himself We have had many a laugh over it since The fact of the matter
is the only affliction from which he was suffering was an inordinate
desire to make my acquaintance Not for my own sakeoh dear nobut
because I was John Darrows family physician and would be reasonably
sure to know Gwen Darrow that gentlemans daughter He had first
met her he told me after we had become intimate at an exhibition of
paintings by William T Richardsbut as you will soon be wondering if
it were on his part a case of love at first sight I had best relate
the incident to you in his own words as he told it to me This will
relieve me of passing any judgment upon the matter for you will then
know as much about it as I and doubtless be quite as capable of
answering the question for candour compels me to own that my knowledge
of the human heart is entirely professional Think of searching for
Cupids darts with a stethoscope

I was standing Maitland said before a masterpiece of sea and rock
such as only Richards can paint It was a view of Lands End Cornwall
and in the artists very best vein My admiration made me totally
unmindful of my surroundings so much so indeed that although
the gallery was crowded I caught myself expressing my delight in a
perfectly audible undertone My enthusiasm since it was addressed to no
one soon began to attract attention and people stopped looking at the
pictures to look at me I was conscious of this in a vague faroff way
much as one is conscious of a conversation which seems to have followed
him across the borderland of sleep and I even thought that I ought to
be embarrassed How long I remained thus transported I do not know The
first thing I remember is hearing someone close beside me take a quick
deep breath one of those full inhalations natural to all sensitive
natures when they come suddenly upon something sublime I turned and
looked I have said I was transported by that canvas of sea and rocks
and have therefore no word left to describe the emotion with which
I gazed upon the exquisite living palpitating picture beside me A
composite photograph of all the Madonnas ever painted from the Sistine
to Bodenhausens could not have been more lovely more ineffably
womanly than that young girl radiant with the divine glow of artistic
delightat least that is my opinion which by the bye I should
perhaps have stated a little more gingerly inasmuch as you are
yourself acquainted with the young lady Now dont look incredulous
noticing my surprise Black hairnot brown black clear pink and
white complexion large deep violet eyes with a remarkable poise to
themHere I continued the description for him Slight of figure a
full honest waist without a suggestion of that execrable deathtrap
Dame Fashions hideous cuirass a little above middle height
deliberate and therefore graceful in all her movements carries
herself in a way to impress one with the idea that she is innocent
without that timehonoured concomitant ignorance half girl half
woman shy yet strong and in a word very beautifulthats Gwen
Darrow I paused here and Maitland went on somewhat dubiously Yes
its not hard to locate such a woman She makes her presence as clearly
felt among a million of her sex as does a grain of fuchsine in a
hogshead of water If with a few ounces of this Tyndall could colour
Lake Geneva so with Gwen Darrow one might such is the power of the
ideal change the ethical status of a continent

He then told me how he had made a study of Miss Darrows movements and
had met her many times since in fact so often that he fancied from
something in her manner that she had begun to wonder if his frequent
appearance were not something more than a coincidence The fear that
she might think him dogging her footsteps worried him and he began as
sedulously to avoid the places he knew she frequented as he previously
had sought them This he confessed made him utterly miserable He had
to be sure never spoken to her but it was everything to be able to see
her When he could endure it no longer he had come to me under pretence
of feeling ill that he might when he had made my acquaintance get me
to introduce him to the Darrows

You will understand of course that I did not learn all this at our
first interview Maitland did not take me into his confidence until we
had had a conference at his laboratory devoted entirely to scientific
speculations On this occasion he surprised me not a little by turning
to me suddenly and saying Some of the grandest sacrifices the world
has ever known if one may judge by the fortitude they require and
the pain they cause have occurred in the laboratory I looked at him
inquiringly and he continued When a man simply for the great love
of truth that is in him has given his life to the solution of some
problem and has at last arrived after years of closest application
at some magnificent generalisationwhen he has perhaps published his
conclusions and received the grateful homage of all lovers of truth
his life has indeed borne fruit Of him may it then be justly said
that his

    life hath blossomed downward like
 The purple bellflower

But suddenly in the privacy of his laboratory a single fact arises
from the testtube in his trembling hand and confronts him His brain
reels the glass torment falls upon the floor and shatters into
countless pieces but he is not conscious of it for he feels it thrust
through his heart When he recovers from the first shock he can only
ejaculate Is it possible After a little he is able to reason I
was fatigued he says perhaps my senses erred I can repeat the
experiment again and be sure But if it overthrow those conclusions
for which I have given my life he gasps My generalisation is firmly
established in the minds of allall but myselfno one will ever chance
upon this particular experiment and it may not disprove my theory after
all better much better that the floor there keep the secret of it all
both from me and from others But even as he says this to himself he
has taken a new tube from the rack and crawledten years older for that
last ten minutesto his chemical case The lifelong habit of truth is
so strong in him that selfinterest cannot submerge it He repeats the
experiment and confirms his fears The battle between his life and a
few drops of liquid in a testtube has been mercilessly fought and
he has lost The elasticity of the man is gone forever and the only
indication the world ever receives of this terrible conflict between a
human soul and its destiny is some half a dozen lines in Nature giving
the experiment and stating that it utterly refutes its authors previous
conclusions Half a dozen linesthe epitaph of a dead though unburied
life

My companion paused there but I found myself unable to reply He had
spoken with such intensity such dramatic fervour that I was completely
swept away by his eloquence so much so indeed that it did not even
occur to me to ask myself why he should have burst out in this peculiar
strain I have given you the incident in order that you may see the
strange moods into which Maitland occasionally relapsedat least at
that time After a quick glance at me he continued in a quieter vein
All of us men of science have felt something however little of this
and I believe as a class scientists transcend all other men in their
respect for absolute truth He cast another one of his searching
glances at me and said quickly This is precisely why I am going to
confide in you and rely upon your assistance in a matter the successful
termination of which would please me as much as the discovery of an
absolute standard of measurement

He then made the confession which I have already given you and ended
by asking me to secure him an introduction to Miss Darrow I cheerfully
promised to bring this about at the first opportunity He asked me if
I thought on account of his having met her so frequently she would be
likely to think it was all a put up job

I do not know I replied Miss Darrow is a singularly close observer
On the whole I think you had better reach her through her father Do you
play croquet He replied that he was considered something of an expert
in that line That then was surely the best way John Darrow was known
in the neighbourhood as a crank on the subject of croquet He had
spent many hundreds of dollars on his grounds His wickets were fastened
to hard pine planks and these were then carefully buried two feet
deep The surface of the ground he was wont to descant must be of a
particular sort of gravel sifted just so and rolled to a nicety The
balls must be of hard rubber and have just oneeighth inch clearance in
passing through the wickets with the exception of the two wires forming
the cage where it was imperative that this clearance should be
reduced to onesixteenth of an inchbut I need not state more to show
how he came to be considered a crank upon the subject

It was easy enough to bring Maitland and Darrow together My friend is
himself much interested in the game he heard of your superb ground
may he be permitted to examine it closely Darrow was all attention He
would be delighted to show it Suppose they make a practical test of it
by playing a game This they did and Maitland played superbly but he
was hardly a match for the old gentleman who sought to palliate his
defeat by saying You play an excellent game sir but I am a trifle
too much for you on my own ground Now if you can spare the time I
should like to witness a game between you and my daughter I think you
will be pretty evenly matched

If he could spare the time I laughed outright at the idea Why with
the prospect of meeting Gwen Darrow before him an absolute unit of
measure with a snails pace would have made good its escape from him
As it is a trick of poor humanity to refuse when offered the very thing
one has been madly scheming to obtain I hastened to accept Darrows
invitation for my friend and to assure him on my own responsibility
that time was just then hanging heavily on Maitlands hands Well the
game was played but Maitland was so unnerved by the girls presence
that he played execrably so poorly indeed that the always polite
Darrow remarked You must charge your easy victory Gwen to your
opponents gallantry not to his lack of skill for I assure you he gave
me a much harder rub The young lady cast a quick glance at Maitland
which said so plainly that she preferred a fair field and no favour that
he hastened to say Your father puts too high an estimate upon my play
I did my best to win butbut I was a little nervous I see however
that you would have defeated me though I had been in my best form Gwen
gave him one of those short searching looks so peculiarly her own
which seem to read with mathematical certainty ones innermost
thoughtsand the poor fellow blushed to the tips of his earsBut
he was no boy this Maitland and betrayed no other sign of the tempest
that was raging within him His utterance remained as usual deliberate
and incisive and I thought this perplexed the young lady Before
leaving both Maitland and I were invited to become parties to a
sixhanded game to be played the following week after the grounds had
been redressed with gravel

Maitland looked forward to this second meeting with Miss Darrow with an
eagerness which made every hour seem interminably long and he was in
such a flutter of expectancy that I was sure if

 We live    in thoughts not breaths
 In feelings not in figures on a dial
 We should count time by heartthrobs

he must have passed through a period as long as that separating the
Siege of Troy from the late unpleasantness The afternoon came at
last however The party consisted besides Darrow and his daughter
Maitland and myself of two young gentlemen with whom personally I had
but a slight acquaintance although I knew them somewhat by reputation
The younger one Clinton Browne is a young artist whose landscapes were
beginning to attract wide attention in Boston and the elder
Charles Herne a Western gentleman of some literary attainments but
comparatively unknown here in the East There is nothing about Mr Herne
that would challenge more than passing attention If you had said
of him He is wellfleshed wellgroomed and intellectually
wellthatched you would have voiced the opinion of most of his
acquaintances

This somewhat elaborately upholstered old world has a deal of mere
filling of one kind and another and Mr Herne is a part of it To be
sure he leaves the category of excelsior very far behind and approaches
very nearly to the best grade of curled hair but in spite of all this
he is simply a sort of social filling

Mr Browne on the other hand is a very different personage Of medium
height closely knit with the latent activity and grace of the cat
flowing through every movement and even stagnating in his pose he is
a man that the first casual gaze instantly returns to with sharpened
focus You have seen gymnasts whose normal movements were slowly
performed springs just as rust is a slow combustion and fire the same
thing in less time Well Clinton Browne strongly suggested that sort
of athlete Add to this a regularly formed clearly cut and
allbutbeautiful face with a pair of wonderfully piercing albeit
somewhat shifty black eyes and one need not marvel that men as well as
women stared at him I have spoken of his gaze as somewhat shifty yet
am not altogether sure that in that term I accurately describe it
What first fastened my attention was this vague unfocussed roving
quasiintrospective vision flashing with pantherlike suddenness into a
directness that seemed to burn and pierce one like the thrust of a hot
stiletto His face was cleanshaven save for a mere thumbmark of black
hair directly under the centre of his lower lip This Iagolike tab
and the almost fierce brilliancy of his concentrated gaze gave to his
countenance at times a sinister Machiavellian expression that was
irresistible and which to my thinking seriously marred an otherwise
fine face Of course due allowance must be made for the strong prejudice
I have against any form of beard However Id wager a box of my best
liverpills against any landscape Browne ever paintedI dont care if
its as big as a cycloramathat if he had known how completely
Gwen shared my viewshow she disliked the appearance of bewhiskered
menthat delicately nurtured little imperial would soon have been
reduced to a tender memorythat is to say if a physician can
diagnose a case of love from such symptoms as devouring glances and an
attentiveness so marked that it quite disgusted Maitland who repeatedly
measured his rival with the apparent cold precision of a mathematician
albeit there was warmth enough underneath

This singular selfpoise is one of Maitlands most noticeable
characteristics and is I think rather remarkable in a man of such
strong emotional tendencies and lightninglike rapidity of thought No
doubt some small portion of it is the result of acquirement for life
can hardly fail to teach us all something of this sort still I
cannot but think that the larger part of it is native to him Born
of welltodo parents he had never had the splendid tuition of early
poverty As soon as he had left college he had studied law and had been
admitted to the bar This he had done more to gratify the wishes of his
father than to further any desires of his own but he had soon found the
profession so distasteful to him that he practically abandoned it in
favour of scientific research True he still occasionally took a legal
case when it turned upon scientific points which interested him but as
he once confessed to me he swallowed at such times the bitter pill of
the law for the sugar coating of science which enshrouded it This legal
training could therefore it seems to me have made no deep or radical
change in his character which leads me to think that the selfcontrol
he exhibited despite the angry disgust with which I know Brownes so
apparent attentions to Gwen inspired him must for the most part have
been native to him rather than acquired

Nothing worthy of record occurred until evening at least nothing which
at the time impressed me as of import though I afterward remembered
that Darrows behaviour was somewhat strange He appeared singularly
preoccupied and on one occasion started nervously when I coughed behind
him He explained that a disagreeable dream had deprived him of his
sleep the previous night and left his nerves somewhat unstrung and I
thought no more of it

When the light failed we were all invited into the parlour to listen to
a song by Miss Darrow The house as you are perhaps aware overlooks
Dorchester Bay The afternoon had been very hot but at dusk a cold east
wind had sprung up which as it was still early in the season was not
altogether agreeable to our host sitting as he was back to though
fully eight feet from an open window looking to the east Maitland
with his usual quick observation noticed his discomfort and asked if he
should not close the window The old gentleman did not seem to hear the
question until it was repeated when starting as if from a reverie he
said If it will not be too warm for the rest of you I would like to
have it partly closed say to within six inches for the wind is cold
and he seemed to relapse again into his reverie Maitland was obliged to
use considerable strength to force the window down as it stuck in the
casing and when it finally gave way it closed with a loud shrieking
sound ending in the bang of the counterweights At the noise Darrow
sprang to his feet exclaiming Again The same sound I knew I could
not mistake it but by this time Gwen was at his side pressing him
gently back into his seat as she said to him in an undertone audible
to all of us What is it father The old gentleman only pressed her
closer by way of reply while he said to us apologetically You must
excuse me gentlemen I have a certain dream which haunts methe dream
of someone striking me out of the darkness Last night I had the same
dream for the seventh time and awoke to hear that window opened There
is no mistaking the sound I heard just now it is identical with that
I heard last night I sprang out of bed took a light and rushed down
here for I am not afraid to meet anything I can see but the window
was closed and locked as I had left it What do you think Doctor he
said turning to me are dreams ever prophetic

 I have never I replied anxious to quiet him had any
personal experience justifying such a conclusion I did not tell him
of certain things which had happened to friends of mine and so my reply
reassured him

Maitland who had been startled by the old gentlemans conduct now
returned to the window and opened it about six inches There was no
other window open in the room and yet so fresh was the air that we
were not uncomfortable Darrow with illconcealed pride then asked his
daughter to sing and she left him and went to the piano Shall I
not light the lamp I asked I think we shall not need it the old
gentleman replied music is always better in the gloaming

In order that you may understand what follows it will be necessary for
me to describe to you our several positions in the room The apartment
is large nearly square and occupies the southeast corner of the house
The eastern side of the room has one window that which had been left
open about six inches and on the southern side of the room there were
two windows both of which were securely fastened and the blinds of
which had been closed by the painters who that morning had primed
the eastern and southern sides of the house preparatory to giving it a
thorough repainting On the north side of the room but much nearer
to the western than the eastern end are folding doors These on this
occasion were closed and fastened On the western side of the room is
the piano and to the left of it near the southwest corner is a door
leading to the hallway This door was closed As I have already told
you Darrow sat in a highbacked easychair facing the piano and almost
in the centre of the room The partly opened window on the east side was
directly behind him and fully eight feet away Herne and Browne sat upon
Darrows right and a little in front of him against the folding doors
while Maitland and I were upon his left between him and the hall door
Gwen was at the piano There are no closets draperies or niches in the
room I think you will now be able to understand the situation fully

Whether the gloom of the scene suggested it to her or whether it was
merely a coincidence I do not know but Miss Darrow began to sing In
the Gloaming in a deep rich contralto voice which seemed fraught
with a weird melancholy power When I say that her voice was ineffably
sympathetic I would not have you confound this quality either with the
sepulchral or the aspirated tone which usually is made to do duty for
sympathy especially in contralto voices Every note was as distinct as
brilliantly resonant as a cello in a masters hand So clear so full
the notes rang out that I could plainly feel the chair vibrate beneath
me

 In the gloaming O my darling
 When the lights are dim and low
 And the quiet shadows falling
 Softly come and softly go
 When the winds are sobbing faintly
 With a gentle unknown woe
 Will you think of me and love me
 As you did once long ago

 In the gloaming O my darling
 Think not bitterly of me
 Though I passed away in silence
 Left you lonely set you free
 For my heart was crushed with longing
 What had been could never be
 It was best to leave you thus dear
 Best for you and best


But the line was never finished With a wild cry more of fear than of
pain Darrow sprang from his chair Gentlemen I have been stabbed
was all he said and fell back heavily into his seat Gwen was kneeling
before him in an instant even before I could assist him His right
hand was pressed to his throat and his eyes seemed starting from their
sockets as he shouted hoarsely A light a light For Gods sake dont
let him strike me again in the dark Maitland was already lighting the
gas and Herne and Browne so Browne afterward told me were preparing
to seize the assailant I remembered after it all was over a quick
movement Browne had made toward the darkest corner of the room

The apartment was now flooded with light and I looked for the assassin
He was not to be found The room contained only Gwen Darrow and his
four invited guests The doors were closed the windows had not been
touched No one could possibly have entered or left the room and
yet the assassin was not there But one solution remained Darrow was
labouring under a delusion and Gwens voice would restore him As she
was about to speak I stepped back to note the effect of her words upon
him Do not fear father she said in a low voice as she laid her face
against his cheek there is nothing here to hurt you You are illI
will get you a glass of cordial and you will be yourself again in a
moment She was about to rise when her father seized her frantically by
the arm exclaiming in a hoarse whisper Dont leave me Cant you see
Dont leave me and for the first time he removed his hand from his
throat and taking her head between his palms gazed wistfully into her
face He tried to speak again but could not and glanced up at us with
a helpless expression which I shall never forget Maitland his eyes
riveted upon the old gentleman whose thoughts he seemed to divine
hurriedly produced a pencil and notebook and held them toward him but
he did not see them for he had drawn Gwens face down to him and was
kissing her passionately The next instant he was on his feet and from
the swollen veins that stood out like cords upon his neck and forehead
we could see the terrible effort he was making to speak At last the
words camecame as if they were torn hissing from his throat for
he took a full breath between each one of them GwenIknewit
Goodbye Rememberyourpromiseand he fell a limp mass into his
chair overcome I felt sure by the fearful struggle he had made
Maitland seized a glass of water and threw it in his face I loosened
the clothing about his neck and in doing so his head fell backward and
his face was turned upward toward me The features were drawnthe eyes
were glazed and set I felt of his heart he was dead




CHAPTER II

 Silence is the only tender Death can make to Mystery


The look of pain and astonishment upon my face said plainly enough to
Gwen

Your father is dead I could not speak In the presence of her great
affliction we all stood silent and with bowed heads I had thought
Darrows attack the result of an overwrought mental condition which
would speedily readjust itself and had so counted upon his daughters
influence as all but certain to immediately result in a temporary cure
When therefore I found him dead without any apparent cause I was for
the time being too dazed to think much less to act and I think the
other gentlemen were quite as much incapacitated as I My first thought
when I recovered so that I could think was of Gwen I felt sure her
reason must give way under the strain and I thought of going nearer to
her in case she should fall but refrained when I noticed that Maitland
had noiselessly glided within easy reach of her To move seemed
impossible to me Such a sudden transition from warm vigorous life to
cold impassive death seems to chill the dynamic rivers of being into a
horrible winter static and eternal Though death puts all things in the
past tense even we physicians cannot but be strangely moved when the
soul thus hastily deserts the body without the usual farewell of an
illness

Contrary to my expectations Gwen did not faint For a long timeit
may not have been more than twenty minutes but it seemed under the
peculiar circumstances at least an hourshe remained perfectly
impassive She neither changed colour nor exhibited any other sign of
emotion She stood gazing quietly tenderly at her fathers body as
if he were asleep and she were watching for some indication of his
awakening Then a puzzled expression came over her countenance There
was no trace of sorrow in it only the look of perplexity I decided to
break the gruesome silence but the thought of how my own voice would
sound in that aweinspired stillness frightened me Gwen herself was the
first to speak She looked up with the same impassive countenance from
which now the perplexed look had fled and said simply

Gentlemen what is to be done Her voice was firm and sanethat it
was pitched lower than usual and had a suggestion of intensity in it
was perfectly natural I thought she did not realise her loss and said
He has gone past recall Yes she replied I know that but should
we not send for an officer An officer I exclaimed Is it possible
you entertain a doubt that your fathers death resulted from natural
causes She looked at me a moment fixedly and then said deliberately
My father was murdered I was so surprised and pained that for a
moment I could not reply and no one else sought to break the silence

Maitland as if Gwens last remark had given rise to a sudden
determination glided to the body He examined the throat raised the
right hand and looked at the fingers then he stepped back a little and
wrote something in his notebook This done he tried the folding doors
and found them locked on the inside then the two windows on the south
side of the room which he also found fastened He opened the hall door
slightly and the hinges creaked noisily of all of which he made a
note Then taking a rule from his pocket he went to the east window and
measured the opening and then the distance between this window and
the chair in which the old gentleman had sat recording his results as
before His next act astonished me not a little and had the effect of
recalling me to my senses With his penknife he cut a circle in the
carpet around each leg of the chair on which the body rested He
continued his examinations with quiet thoroughness but I ceased now
to follow him closely since I had begun to feel the necessity of
convincing Gwen of her error and was casting about for the best way to
do so

My dear Miss Darrow I said at length you attach too much importance
to the last words of your father who it is clear was not in his
right mind You must know that he has for some months had periods
of temporary aberration and that all his delusions have been of a
sanguinary nature Try to think calmly I said perceiving from her
expression that I had not shaken her conviction in the least Your
father said he had been stabbed You must see that such a thing is
physically impossible Had all the doors and windows been open no
object so large as a man could possibly have entered or left the room
without our observing him but the windows were closed and fastened
with the exception of the east window which as you may see for
yourself is open some six inches or so in which position it is secured
by the spring fastening The folding doors are locked on the inside and
the only possible means of entrance therefore would have been by the
hall door Directly in front of that between it and your father sat
Mr Maitland and myself You see by my chair that I was less than two
feet from the door It is inconceivable that in that halflight anyone
could have used that entrance and escaped observation Do you not see
how untenable your idea is Had your father been stabbed he would have
bled but I am as certain as though I had made a thorough examination
that there is not so much as a scratch anywhere upon his body Gwen
heard me through in silence and then said wearily in a voice which had
now neither intensity nor elasticity I understand fully the apparent
absurdity of my position yet I know my father was murdered The wound
which caused his death has escaped your notice but

My dear Miss Darrow I interrupted there is no wound you may be
sure of that For the first time since Darrows death Maitland spoke
If you will look at the throat a little more closely you will see what
may be a wound he said and went on quietly with his examinations
He was right there was a minute abrasion visible The girls quick
observation had detected what had escaped me convinced as I was that
there was nothing to be found by a scrutiny however close

Gwen now transferred her attention to Maitland and asked Had not one
of us better go for an officer Maitland whose power of concentration
is so remarkable as on some occasions to render him utterly oblivious of
his surroundings did not notice the question and Browne replied to it
for him I should be only too happy to fetch an officer for you if you
wish he said Have you ever noticed how acute the mind is for trifles
and slight incongruities when under the severe tension of such a shock
as we had experienced Such attacks threatening to invade and forever
subjugate our happiness seem to have the effect of so completely
manning the ramparts of our intellect the nothing however trivial
escapes observation Gwens father her only near relative lay cold
before herhis death from her standpoint the most painful of
mysteriesand yet the incongruity of Brownes only too happy did
not escape her as was evident by the quick glance and sudden relaxation
of the mouth into the faintest semblance of a smile All this was
momentary and I doubt not half unconscious She replied gravely

I would indeed be obliged if you would do so

Maitland who had now finished his examination noticed that Browne was
about to depart When the artist would have passed him on his way to the
hall door he placed his hand upon that gentlemans shoulder saying
Pardon me sir but I would strongly urge that you do not leave the
room

Browne paused Both men stood like excited animals at gaze




CHAPTER III

 Nothing is so full of possibilities as the seemingly impossible

Maitlands request that Browne should not leave the room seemed to us
all a veritable thunderbolt It impressed me at the time as being a
thinly veneered command and I remember fearing lest the artist should
be injudicious enough to disregard it If he could have seen his own
face for the next few moments he would have had a lesson in expression
which years of portrait work may fail to teach him At length the
rapidly changing kaleidoscope of his mind seemed to settle to group its
varied imaginings about a definite ideathe idea that he had been
all but openly accused in the presence of Miss Darrow of being
instrumental in her fathers death For a moment as he faced Maitland
whom he instinctively felt to be a rival he looked so dark and sinister
that one could easily have believed him capable of almost any crime

Gwen was no less surprised than the rest of us at Maitlands
interference but she did not permit it to show in her voice as she said
quietly Mr Browne has consented to go for an officer As I felt sure
she must have thought Maitland already knew this as anyone else must
have heard what had passed I looked upon her remark as a polite way of
saying

I am mistress here

Maitland apparently so regarded it for he replied quickly I hope you
will not think me officious or unmindful of your right to dictate in a
matter so peculiarly your own affair My only desire is to help you Mr
Brownes departure would still further complicate a case already far
to difficult of solution My legal training has given me some little
experience in these matters and I only wish that you may have the
benefit thereof It is now nearly threequarters of an hour since your
fathers death and I assure you time at this particular juncture may
be of the utmost importance Not a moment should be wasted in needless
discussion If you will consent to despatch a servant to the police
station I will in due time explain to you why I have taken the liberty
of being so insistent on this point

He had hardly ceased speaking before Gwen rang for a servant She
hurriedly told him what had transpired and sent him to the nearest
police station As this was but a few rods away and the messenger was
fleet of foot an officer was soon upon the scene We were able he
said to us generally as he entered the room to catch Medical Examiner
Ferris by phone at his home in F Street and he will be here
directly In the meantime I have been sent along merely to see that the
body is not moved before his examination and that everything in the room
remains exactly as it was at the time of the old gentlemans death Did
I not understand he said to Maitland in an undertone that there is a
suspicion of foul play

Yes replied George that is one explanation which certainly will
have to be considered

I thought I heard the Capn say murder when he phoned in town for
some specials Theyre for detective work on this case I reckon Hello
That sounds like the Doctors rig

A moment later the bell rang and Dr Ferris entered the room

Ah Doctor he said extending his hand to me what have we here

Before I could answer he had noticed Maitland and advanced to shake
hands with him

Is this indeed so serious as I have been told he asked after his
greeting

It seems to me likely replied Maitland slowly to develop into the
darkest mystery I have ever known

Hum replied the Examiner Has the body been moved or the disposition
of its members altered

Not since I arrived replied Officer Barker

And before queried Dr Ferris turning to Maitland

Everything is absolutely intact I have made a few notes and
measurements but I have disturbed nothing replied Maitland

Good said the Examiner May I see those notes before I go You were
on that Parker case and you have you know something of a reputation
for thoroughness Perhaps you may have noted something that would escape
me

The notes Doctor are at your service George replied

Dr Ferris examination of the body was very thorough yet since it was
made with the rapid precision which comes from extended practice it was
soon over Short as it was however it was still an ordeal under which
Gwen suffered keenly to judge from her manner

The Examiner then took Maitland aside looked at his notes and
conversed earnestly with him in an undertone for several minutes I do
not know what passed between them When he left a few moments later
Officer Barker accompanied him

As soon as the door closed behind them Gwen turned to Maitland

Did he give you his opinion she asked with a degree of interest which
surprised me

He will report death as having resulted from causes at present
unknown rejoined Maitland

Gwen seemed greatly relieved by this answer though I confess I was
utterly at a loss to see why she should be

Observing this change in her manner Maitland approached her saying

Will you now permit me to explain my seeming rudeness in interfering
with your plan to make Mr Browne your messenger and at the same time
allow me to justify myself in the making of yet another request

Gwen bowed assent and he proceeded to state the following case as coolly
and accurately as if it were a problem in geometry

Mr Darrow he began has just died under peculiar circumstances
Three possible views of the case at once suggest themselves First his
death may have been due to natural causes and his last expressions the
result of an hallucination under which he was labouring Second he may
have committed suicide as the result perhaps of a mania which in that
case would also serve to explain his last words and acts oryou
will pardon me Miss Darrowthese last appearances may have been
intentionally assumed with a view to deceiving us The officers you have
summoned will not be slow in looking for motives for such a deception
and several possible ones cannot fail at once to suggest themselves to
them Third your father may have been murdered and his last expressions
a more or less accurate description of the real facts of the case It
seems to me that these three theories exhaust the possibilities of the
case Can anyone suggest anything further And he paused for a reply

It is clear replied Mr Herne with portly deliberation that all
deaths must be either natural or unnatural and equally clear that when
unnatural the agent if human must be either the victim himself or
some person external to him

Precisely so continued Maitland Now our friend the Doctor
believes that Mr Darrows death resulted from natural causes The
official authorities will at first in all probability agree with him
but it is impossible to tell what theory they will ultimately adopt If
sufficient motive for the act can be found some are almost certain to
adopt the suicide theory Miss Darrow has expressed her conviction that
we are dealing with a case of murder Mr Browne and Mr Herne have
expressed no opinion on the subject so far as I am aware

At this point Gwen with an eagerness she had not before displayedor
possibly it was nervousnessexclaimed And your own view of the
case I believe Maitland replied deliberately that your fathers
death resulted from poison injected into the blood but this is a matter
so easily settled that I prefer not to theorise upon it There are
several poisons which might have produced the effects we have observed
If however I am able to prove this conjecture correct I have still
only eliminated one of the three hypotheses and resolved the matter to
a choice between the suicide and murder theories yet that is something
gained It is because I believe it can be shown death did not result
from natural causes that I have so strongly urged Mr Browne not to
leave the room

Pardon me sir ejaculated Browne growing very dark and threatening
You mean to insinuate Nothing continued Maitland finishing his
sentence for him and then quietly ignoring the interruption As I have
already said I am somewhat familiar with the usual methods of ferreting
out crime As a lawyer and also as a chemical expert I have listened
to a great deal of evidence in criminal cases and in this and other
ways learned the lines upon which detectives may confidently be
expected to act when once they have set up an hypothesis The means
by which they arrive at their hypotheses occasionally surpass all
understanding and we have therefore no assurance as to the view they
will take of this case The first thing they will do will be to make
what they will call a thorough examination of the premises but a
study of chemistry gives to the word thorough a significance of which
they have no conception It is to shorten this examination as much
as possibleto prevent it from being more tiresome to you than is
absolutely necessary he said to Gwen that I have taken the liberty
of ascertaining and recording most of the data the officers will
require

Believe me Gwen said to him in an undertone not intended for the rest
of us though we heard it I am duly grateful for your consideration
and shall find a fitting time to thank you

With no other reply than a deprecating gesture Maitland continued

Now let us look at the matter from the standpoint of the officers They
must first determine in their own minds how Mr Darrow met his death
This will constitute the basis of their first hypothesis I say first
because they are liable to change it at any moment it seems to them
untenable If they conclude that death resulted from natural causes I
shall doubtless be able to induce them to waive that view of the case
until I have been given time to prove it untenableif I canand to act
for the present upon one of the other two possible theories It appears
from our present knowledge of the case that whichever one of these
they choose the same difficulty will confront them

Gwen looked at him inquiringly and he continued answering the question
in her eyes

This is what I mean Your father whether he committed suicide or
was murdered in all probability met his death through that almost
imperceptible wound under his chin This wound so far as I have yet
been able to examine it without a glass was made with a somewhat blunt
instrument able apparently to little more than puncture the skin and
draw a drop or so of blood Of course on such a theory death must have
resulted from poisoning The essential point is Where is the instrument
that inflicted the wound

Might it not be buried in the flesh Gwen asked

Possibly but as I have not been able to find it I cannot believe it
very likely though closer search may reveal it replied Maitland
Your fathers right forefinger he continued is slightly stained
with blood but the wound is of a nature which could not have been
caused by a finger nail previously poisoned Since we know he pressed
his hand to his throat this bloodstain makes no more strongly toward
the truth of the suicide theory than it does toward that of the murder
hypothesis Suppose now for we must look at all sides of the question
the officers begin to act upon the assumption that murder has been
committed What will they then do They will satisfy themselves that
the east window was opened six and threequarters inches and securely
fastened in that position that the two south windows were closed
and fastened and that the blinds thereof were also closed They will
ascertain the time when death occurredwe can easily tell themand
this will show them that neither of the blinds on the south side could
have been opened without so increasing the light in the room as to be
sure to attract our attention They will learn also that the folding
doors were locked as they are now on this side and that these two
gentlemen indicating Browne and Herne sat against them They will then
turn to the hall door as the only possible means of entrance and I shall
tell them that the Doctor and I sat directly in front of this door and
between it and Mr Darrow I have taken the liberty to cut the carpet to
mark the positions of our chairs In view of all these facts what must
they conclude Simply this no one entered the room did the deed and
then left it at least not without being observed But surely I
ventured to suggest you do not think they will presume to question the
testimony of all of us that no one was observed

That is all negative evidence he replied and does not conclusively
prove that another might not have observed what we failed to detect
However it is all so selfevident that they will not question it I
know so well their methods of reasoning that I am already prepared to
refute their conclusions at every point without I regret to say being
myself able to solve the mystery though I may say in passing that I
purposely am refraining from formulating any theory whatever until I
have ascertained everything which it is possible to learn in the matter
In this way I hope to avoid the error into which the detective is so
prone to fall Once you set up an hypothesis you unconsciously and in
spite of yourself accentuate unduly the importance of all data making
toward that hypothesis while on the other hand you either utterly
neglect misconstrue or fail to fully appreciate the evidence
oppugnant to your theory In chemical research I gather the material for
an entire series of experiments before performing any so that the first
few shall not either by satisfying or discouraging me cause me to
leave the bush half beaten

Let us see how from the officers standpoint the murder hypothesis
now stands No assassin it will be clear to them could have entered or
left this room unobserved If therefore a man did enter the room and
kill our friend we all of us must be his accomplices This remark
drew some sort of exclamatory protest from every other person in the
room save Browne

Ah that is probably the true solution said the artist with
illconcealed disgust

This remark and the tone in which it was uttered would have been
discourteous under any circumstances at this particular time and in the
painful situation in which we all found ourselves it was boorish almost
beyond endurance

There was nothing in Maitlands manner to indicate that he had heard
Brownes remark as he quietly continued

You see this coldblooded view the mere statement of which causes you
all to shudderthe more so because one of our number is the daughter
of the dead manis not to be entertained a moment and is only
mentioned to show the logical chain which will force the officers into
the certain conviction that no assassin did enter or leave this room
What then remains of their theory Two possibilities First the
murderer may have done the deed without entering If so it is clear
that he must have made use of the partlyopened window This seems so
likely that they will seize upon it with avidity At first they will
suggest that the assassin reached in at the window and struck his victim
as he sat by it This they will urge accounts for our not finding the
weapon and they will be so sure that this is the correct solution of
the problem that I shall probably have to point out to them its patent
absurdity This illustrates the danger of forming an hypothesis from
imperfect data Remind them that Mr Darrow did not sit by the window
but eight feet three and onehalf inches from it in almost the exact
centre of the room and their theory falls to the ground only to be
hastily replaced as a drowning man catches at a straw by a slightly
varied theory If the victim sat that distance from the window they
will inform us it is clear the murderous implement must have been
thrown or shot at him by the assassin

Indeed said Mr Herne though I had not thought of that theory it
seems to me so plausible now that you mention it that I think the
officers will show rare acumen if they adopt it Very properly may they
hold that some projectile might have been shot through the partly opened
window and none of us have detected the act

Ah yes rejoined Maitland but when I ask them where this implement
is under this assumption and remind them of what I shall already have
told them viz that Mr Darrow sat back to the window as well as
over eight feet from it and sat in a chair the solid back of which
extended like a protecting shield fully six inches above the top of
his head they will find it difficult to show how unless projectiles
travel in sharp curves or angles a man in this position could thus
receive a wound directly beneath his chin a wound so slight as not to
penetrate the thyroid cartilage immediately under it

The abandonment of this hypothesis will force them to relinquish the
idea that the murder was committed from without What then remains Only
the second alternative They must either give up altogether the idea
of murder or have recourse to what is known as the theory of exclusive
opportunity

Theory of exclusive opportunity repeated Gwen as a puzzled look
overspread her countenance II fear I do not quite understand what
you mean

Pardon me Miss Darrow for not making my meaning clearer to you
said Maitland with a deferential inclination of the head The theory
of exclusive opportunity to state it plainly in this case means simply
this if Mr Darrow were murdered some one of us five we being the
only ones having an opportunity to do the deed must be the assassin
Whether this view be taken or that of suicide it becomes of paramount
importance to find the weapon Do you not now see why I objected to
having anyone leave the room If as appears likely from my search the
weapon is not to be found and if as I feel reasonably certain either
the suicide or the murder theory be substantiated then anyone who left
the room before official search was made would be held to have taken
the weapon with him and disposed of it because his would have been the
exclusive opportunity of so doing Someone must have disposed of it
and no one else had a chance to do so that would be the way it would
be stated But since no one of us has left the room a thorough search
both of it and of our persons must convince the officers that we
at least are not responsible for the fact that the weapon is not
forthcoming

Maitland paused and looked at Browne as if he expected him to speak but
that gentleman only shut his square jaws the more firmly together and
held his peaceat least in so far as words were concerned If looks
like actions speak louder than words this black visage with its two
points of fire made eloquent discourse I charged all this display of
malice to jealousy It is not altogether pleasant to be placed at a
disadvantage before the one being whose good opinion one prizes above
all things elsethat is to say I have read that such is the case I
do not consider my own views upon such matters expert testimony In all
affairs of the heart my opinions cease to have weight at exactly the
point where that organ ceases to be a pump

Even Gwen I think noticed Brownes determined silence for she said to
Maitland

I am very grateful that your forethought prevented me from causing Mr
Browne even temporary annoyance by making him my messenger

She paused a moment and then continued

You were speaking of the officers theories When they have convinced
themselves that no one of us has removed the weapon what then

In my opinion said Maitland they will ultimately fall back upon
the suicide theory but they must find the weapon here before they can
substantiate it for if it be not here someone must have taken it away
and that someone could have only been the one who used itthe assassin
in shortbut here are the officers Let each one of us insist upon
being searched They can send to the station for a woman to search you
he said in an undertone to Gwen and then added I trust you will
pardon my suggesting a course which in your case seems so utterly
unnecessary but believe me there are urgent reasons for it which I
can explain later If we would hope to solve this mystery everything
depends upon absolute thoroughness at this juncture

I should evince but poor appreciation Gwen replied of the
ability you have already shown should I fail to follow your slightest
suggestion It is all I can offer you by way of thanks for the kind
interest you have taken

The return of Officer Barker accompanied by three other men now
changed the tide of conversation Maitland advanced and shook hands
with one whom he introduced as Mr Osborne and this gentleman in turn
introduced his brother officer a Mr Allen and M Godin a special
detective

Osborne impressed me as a man of only mediocre ability thoroughly
imbued with the idea that he is exceptionally clever He spoke loudly
and I thought a bit ostentatiously yet withal in a manner so frank
and hearty that I could not help liking the fellow

M Godin on the contrary seemed retiring almost to the point of
selfabnegation He said but little apparently preferring to keep
in the background where he could record his own observations in his
notebook without too frequent interruption His manner was polished
in the extreme and so frank withal that he seemed to me like a man of
glass through whom every thought shone unhindered I wondered how
one who seemed powerless to conceal his own emotions should possess
a detectives ability to thread his way through the dark and hidden
duplicity of crime When he spoke it was in a low velvety and soothing
voice that fell upon the ear with an irresistible charm When Osborne
would make some thoughtless remark fraught with bitterness for Gwen
such an expression of pain would flit across M Godins fine face as
one occasionally sees in those highly organised and sympathetic
naturesusually found among women if a doctors experience may be
trustedwhich catch the throb of anothers hurt even as adjacent
strings strive to sing each others songs

M Godin seemed to me more priest than detective His cleanshaven face
its beautifully chiselled features suffused with that peculiar pallor
which borrows the transparency of marble the large limpid brown eyes
and the delicate kindly mouthall these combined with a faultless
manner and a carriage suggestive of power in reserve so fascinated
me that I found myself watching him continually I remember saying to
myself What a rival he would make in a womans affections

At just that time he was looking at Gwen with tender solicitous
sympathy written in every feature and that doubtless suggested my
thought

Mr Allen was even more ordinary than Mr Osborne in manner and
appearance I do not presume to judge his real merits for I did not
notice him sufficiently to properly portray him to you even if I had
the gift of description which I think you will admit I have not He
lives in my memory only as a something tall spare coarse of texture
red hairy and redolent of poor tobacco

How different men are Of course women are all alike While Osborne
like a goodnatured bumblebee was buzzing noisily about as though
all the world were his cloverblossom and Allen so far as I know was
doing nothing M Godin alert and keen despite his gentleness and a
modesty which kept him for the most part unobtrusively in the shadow of
his chosen corner was writing rapidly in a notebook and speaking
no word It seemed as if nothing escaped him Clearly he was there
to enlighten himself rather than others At length pausing to make a
measurement he noticed my gaze and said to me in an undertone as he
glanced solicitously at Gwen lest she should hear

Pardon me but did any of you observe anything at or about the time
of Mr Darrows death which impressed you as singularany noise any
shadow any draught or change of temperature say a rushing or I might
say swishing soundanything in fact that would seem to you as at all
unusual

Nothing whatever I replied Everything seemed perfectly normal and
commonplace

Hum Strange he said and returned to his notes

I felt sure M Godin had had a theory and that my testimony had not
strengthened it but he did not volunteer any information neither did
he take part in the conversation of his companions and so my curiosity
remained ungratified It was clear that M Godins methods were very
different from those of Osborne and Allen

I need not weary you by further narrating what occurred at this official
examination Suffice it to say that with one or two minor exceptions
Osborne and Allen followed the precise course of reasoning prophesied
by Maitland and as for M Godin he courteously but firmly held his
peace The two officers did not however lean as strongly to the theory
that death resulted from natural causes as Maitland had anticipated
and I think this surprised him He had already told them that
he expected to be able to show death to have resulted from poison
hypodermically applied and as I overheard a remark made by Osborne
to Allen I readily understood their speedy abandonment of their
naturaldeath theory They were engaged in verifying Maitlands
measurement of the east side of the room when Osborne said softly to his
companion He has figured in several of my cases as a chemical expert
and when he expresses an opinion on a matter its about the same as
proved Hes not the kind that jumps in the dark Hes a lawyer as well
as chemist and knows whats evidence so I reckon wed better see if we
can make anything out of the suicide and murder theories

Maitland had asked them to send to the station for a woman to search
Gwen and she had just arrived We all requested that a most thorough
examination should now be made to assure the officers that no one of us
possessed the missing weapon This done the officers and departed for
the night assuring Gwen that there was nothing further to be done till
morning and Osborne doubtless with a view to consoling her said It
may be a relief to you miss to know that there is scarcely a doubt
that your father took his own life This had an effect upon Gwen very
different from that which had been intended Her face contracted and it
was plain to see she was beginning to think everyone was determined to
force a falsehood upon her Herne and Browne also prepared to take their
leave A glance from Maitland told me he wished me to remain with him a
moment after the others had departed and I accordingly did so

When we were alone with Gwen he said to her I think I understand your
feeling with regard to Mr Osbornes remark as well as your conviction
that it does not represent the truth I foresaw they would come to this
conclusion and know very well the pains they will take to prove their
hypothesis Can nothing be done she asked beseechingly It is
that of which I wish to speak he replied If you have sufficient
confidence in me to place the case in my hands I will do everything in
my power to establish the truthon one condition and he glanced
at her face now pale and rigid from her longcontinued effort of
selfcontrol And that condition is she said quickly That you
follow my directions and permit me to order your movements in all
things so long as the case remains in my hands if at any time I seek
to abuse your faith you are as free to discharge me as if I were a paid
detective Gwen looked searchingly at him then extending her hand to
him she said impulsively You are very kind I accept the condition
What shall I do

I tried to catch Maitlands eye to tell him what he should counsel her
but a man with his ability to observe conditions and grasp situations
can very well do without prompting First he said you must return
home with the Doctor and spend the rest of the night with his sister
I shall stay here until morning and second I desire that you use your
utmost endeavour to keep the incidents of this evening out of your mind
You cannot of course forget your loss unless you sleepand he gave
me a look which said I depend on you to see to thatbut you must
not continually reenact the scene in imagination In the morning the
Doctor will come here to bring me my camera microscope and a few
things I shall require and he passed me a list he had written
If you have slept well you can be of considerable service and may
accompany himif not you must remain quietly at his house With
this he turned to me and said She is making a condenser of herself
Doctor and will soon break through the insulation Sparks will be
dangerousyou must secure the brush effect He spoke quickly and
used electrical terms that she might not understand him but either
he failed of his purpose or the observation she immediately made was
a strange coincidence I believe she understood for while young
women educated by their mothers are usually ignorant upon all the more
masculine subjects those who have long been their fathers companions
are ever prone to startle one with the most unexpected flashes of
intelligence I am in rather a high state of tension now she said
turning calmly to Maitland but when alone the expression which
has been denied me here will afford relief Maitland glanced at
her quickly and then at me and I knew he was wondering if she had
understood Then he said It is getting late I shall expect you to
sleep well and to come in the morning Please say to the servants as you
go that I shall stay here all night and that no one must enter without
permission Goodnight She held out her hand to him but made no
reply then she fervently kissed her fathers lips and together we left
the chamber of death




CHAPTER IV


 Death speaks with the tongue of Memory and his ashen hand reaches
 out of the great unknown to seize and hold fast our plighted souls

What Maitlands reason was for spending the night with the dead body of
Darrow or how he busied himself until morning I do not know Perhaps
he desired to make sure that everything remained untouched or it may
be that he chose this method of preventing Gwen from performing a vigil
by the body I thought this latter view very probable at the time as
I had been singularly impressed with the remarkable foresight my
friend had displayed in so quickly and adroitly getting Gwen away from
everything connected with her fathers sad and mysterious death

Arriving at my house my sister took an early opportunity to urge upon
Gwen a glass of wine in which I had placed a generous sedative The
terrible tension soon began to relax and in less than half an hour she
was sleeping quietly I dreaded the moment when she should awake and the
memory of all that had happened should descend like an avalanche upon
her I told my sister that this would be a critical moment cautioning
her to stay by Gwen and to give her immediately upon her arising
a draught I had prepared for the purpose of somewhat deadening her
sensibilities I arose early and went to Maitlands laboratory to
collect the things he desired When I returned Gwen was awake and to
my intense gratification in even a better condition than I had dared to
hope

It was quite late when we reached her house and Maitland had evidently
been at work several hours He looked sharply at Gwen when she
entered and seemed much pleased at her condition You have obeyed
my instructions I see and slept he said as he gave her his hand
Yes she replied I was very tired and the doctors cordial quite
overcame me and she cast an inquiring glance at the network of white
string which Maitland had stretched across the carpet dividing it into
squares like an immense checkerboard In reply to her questioning look
he said French detectives are the most thorough in the world and I am
about to make use of their method of instituting an exhaustive search
Each one of the squares formed by these intersecting strings is
numbered and represents one square foot of carpet the numbers running
from one to two hundred and eightyeight Every inch of every one of
these squares I shall examine under a microscope and anything found
which can be of any possible interest will be carefully preserved and
its exact location accurately marked upon this chart I have prepared
which as you will see has the same number of squares as the room the
area of each square being reduced from one square foot to one square
inch You will note that I have already marked the location of all
doors windows and furniture The weapon if there be one may be very
minute but if it be on the floor we may be assured the microscope will
find it The walls of the room especially any shelving projections and
the furniture I shall examine with equal thoroughness though I have
now some additional reasons for believing the weapon is not here

Have you discovered anything new Gwen exclaimed unable to control
the excitement caused by this last remark You must pardon me
Maitland rejoined if I ask you and the Doctor a question before
replying She nodded assent and he continued I wish to know if you
agree with me that we shall be more likely to arrive at a solution of
the problem before us if we keep our own counsel than if we take
the officers of the law or for that matter anyone else into our
confidence You undoubtedly noticed how carefully M Godin kept his own
counsel Official methods and the hasty generalisations which form a
part thereofto say nothing of the petty rivalries and the passion for
notorietycan do much to hinder our own work and I believe nothing
to help it What say you That we keep our work to ourselves Gwen
quickly rejoined and I signified that I was of the same opinion
Then Maitland continued I may say this in answer to your question
I have ascertained something which may bear upon the case in hand You
will remember that part of the gravel for redressing the croquet ground
was dumped under the east window there The painters I learn finished
painting that side of the house yesterday forenoon before the gravel was
removed and placed upon the ground so that any footprints they may have
made in it while about their work were obliterated As you see there
was loose gravel left under the window to the depth of about two
inches I carefully examined this gravel this morningthere were no
footprints

I glanced at Gwen her face had a set expression and she was deathly
pale There were however he continued places where the gravel
had been tamped down as if by the pressure of a rectangular board I
examined these minutely and by careful measurement and close scrutiny
of some peculiar markings suggestive of the grain of wood satisfied
myself that the depressions in the gravel were made by two and not as
I had at first thought by one small piece of wood I found further that
these two boards had always borne certain relative relations to each
other and that when one had been turned around the other had undergone
a similar rotation This last is in my mind a most important point
for when coupled with the fact that between any two impressions of the
same board the distance was sensibly constant and was that of a short
stride there could be no reasonable doubt but these boards had been
worn upon some persons feet They could not have been thrown down
merely to be stepped upon for in that case they would not have borne
fixed relations to each otherprobably would not have been turned end
for end at alland certainly both would not always have happened to
get turned at the same time I procured a board of the combined area
of the two supposed to have made the impressions in the gravel and
weighted it down until as nearly as I could measure it impacted the
soil to the same extent the others had The weight was one hundred and
thirtyfive pounds which is about right for a man five feet five inches
tall The position of the depressions in the gravel indicated a stride
just about right for a man of that height

There was one other most important discovery which I made after I
had divided the impressions into two classesaccording as they were
produced by the right or left boardwhich was that when the right foot
was thrown forward the stride was from three to four inches longer
than when the left foot led Directly under the window there was a deep
impression in the sand I took a plaster cast of it and here it is he
said producing an excellent facsimile of a closed hand There can
be little doubt he continued from the position occupied by the
depression of which this is a reverse copy that it was either
accidentally made by someone who stooping before the east window to
avoid obstructing its light suddenly lost his balance and regained his
equilibrium by thus thrusting out his hand orand this seems far more
likely to methat the hand was deliberately placed in the gravel
in order to steady its possessor while he performed some peculiar
operation

At this point I ventured to ask why he regarded the latter view as
so much more tenable than the former There are several reasons he
replied which render the view I prefer to take all but certain First
the impression was made by the left hand Second it is the impression
of a closed hand with the upper joints of the fingers undermost Did
you ever know one to save himself from falling by thrusting out a closed
hand Certainly not There is a certain amount of fear however slight
invariably associated with losing ones balance This sentiment so far
as the hand is concerned is expressed by opening it and spreading the
fingers This he would instinctively have done if falling Then there
is the position of the impression relative to the window and some slight
testimony upon the sill and glass for the thorough investigation
of which I have been obliged to await my microscope I have worked
diligently but that is all I have been able to accomplish

All exclaimed Gwen regarding him with illconcealed admiration It
seems to me a very great deal The thoroughness the minuteness of it
all overwhelms me but tell me have your discoveries led you to any
conclusion No he replied nothing definite yet I must not allow
myself to become wedded to any theory so long as there is anything
further to be learned If I were to hazard a few idle guesses I should
say your father was murdered in some mysterious wayby a person about
five feet five inches tall weighing say one hundred and thirtyfive
pounds and having a lame leg or perhaps one limb shorter than
the otherat all events having some deformity or ailment causing a
variation in the length of the strides I should guess also that this
persons feet had some marked peculiarity since such pains had
been taken to conceal the footprints Then the cast of the hand here
encourages speculation Fingers long slim and delicate save at the
nails where with the exception of the little finger are to be found
unmistakable signs of the habit of biting the nailssee here are the
hangnailsbut strange to say the nail of the little finger has been
spared and suffered to grow to an unusual length I ask myself why this
particular nail has been so favoured and can only answer because it
has some peculiar use It is clear this is not the hand of a manual
labourer the joints are too small the fingers too delicate the
texture of the skin which is clearly visible much too finein short
wouldnt it pass anywhere for a womans hand Say a woman who bit her
nails If it were really such there would be a pair of feminine feet
also to be concealed and boards would do it very nicelybut this
is all guesswork and must not be allowed to affect any subsequent
conclusions If you will excuse me a few minutes I will use the
microscope a little on the sill of the east window before we are
interrupted by our friends the officers who will be sure to be here
soon

While Maitland was thus engaged I did all in my power to distract Gwens
attention as much as possible from her fathers body Whenever
she regarded it the same intense and set expression overspread her
countenance as that which at first had alarmed me I was glad when
Maitland returned from the window and began mixing some of the chemicals
I had brought him for Gwen invariably followed all his movements as
if her very existence depended upon her letting nothing escape her
Maitland who had asked me for a prescription blank now dipped it in
the chemicals he had mixed and this accomplished put the paper in his
microscope box to dry

I have something here he said which I desire to photograph quite as
much as this room and some of its larger objects and he pinned a
tiny crumpled mass against the wall and made an exposure of it in that
condition Do you know what this is he said as he carefully smoothed
it out for another picture I havent the slightest idea I said It
is plain enough under the microscope he continued placing it upon
the slide and adjusting the focus Would you like to examine it Miss
Darrow Gwen had scarcely put her eye to the instrument before she
exclaimed Why its a piece of thin outside bark from a twig of
alder Maitlands face was a study Would you mind telling me he
said deliberately how you found that out so quickly She hesitated a
moment and then said methodically pointing toward the water I know
the alder wellour boat is moored near a clump of them You are a
keen observer he replied as he took the prepared paper from his box
and spread the film of bark upon it to take a blue print of it There
is one other object upon the sill which unfortunately I cannot take
away with me he continued but shall have to content myself with
photographing I refer to a sinuous line made in the paint while green
and looking as if a short piece of rope or more properly rubber
tubing since there is no ropelike texture visible had been dropped
upon it and hastily removedbut see here are Osborne and Allen
looking for all the world as if they were prepared to demonstrate
a fourth dimension of space Now we shall see the suicide theory
provedto their own satisfaction at least But whatever they say
dont forget we are to keep our own work to ourselves

The two officers were alone M Godin had apparently decided to work by
himself This did not in the least surprise me since I could easily see
that he had nothing to gain by working with these two officers

Weve solved the matter was the first thing Osborne said after
passing the time of day Indeed replied Maitland in a tone which was
decidedly ambiguous you make it suicide I suppose Thats just what
we make it returned the other We hadnt much doubt of it last night
but there were some things such as the motive for example not quite
clear to us but it is all as plain as daylight now

And what says M Godin asked Maitland

Mr Osborne burst into a loud guffaw

Oho but thats good What says M Godin I say Allen Maitland wants
to know what Frenchy says and the pair laughed boisterously Its
plain enough you dont know he continued addressing Maitland Hes
tighter n any champagne bottle you ever saw The corkscrew aint
invented thatll draw a word out of M Godin You saw him making notes
here last night Well the chances are that if this were a murder case
which it isnt youd see no more of M Godin till he bobbed up some
day perhaps on the other side of the earth with a pair of twisters
on the culprit Hes a wiz is M Godin What does he think He knows
what he thinks and hes the only individual on the planet that
enjoys that distinction I say Allen do you pump Frenchy for
the gentlemans enlightenment and again the pair laughed long and
heartily

Well then said Maitland since we cant have M Godins views
we shall have to content ourselves with those of your more confiding
selves Lets hear all about the suicide theory

I think said Osborne in an undertone you had better ask Miss Darrow
to withdraw for a few moments as there are some details likely to pain
her This suggestion was intended only for Maitland but the officer
used to talking in the open air spoke so loudly that we all overheard
him I thank you for your consideration Gwen said to him but I
would much prefer to remain There can be nothing connected with this
matter which I cannot bear to hear or should not know Pray proceed

Osborne anxious to narrate his triumph needed no further urging We
felt sure he began that it was a case of suicide but were perplexed
to know why Mr Darrow should wish to make it appear a murder Of
course we thought he might wish to spare his daughter the shame such an
act would visit upon her but when this was exchanged for the horrible
notoriety of murder the motive didnt seem quite sufficient so
we looked for a stronger oneand found it Ah you are getting
interesting Maitland observed

Osborne cast a furtive glance at Gwen and then continued We learned
on inquiry that certain recent investments of Mr Darrows had turned
out badly In addition to this he had been dealing somewhat extensively
in certain electric and sugar stocks and when the recent financial
crash came he found himself unable to cover his margins and was so
swept clean of everything Nor is this all he had lost a considerable
sum of money in yet another wayjust how my informant would not
discloseand all of these losses combined made his speedy failure
inevitable Under such conditions many another man has committed
suicide unable to face financial ruin But this man had a daughter to
consider and as I have already said he would wish to spare her the
disgrace which the taking of his own life would visit upon her and
more than all would desire that she should not be left penniless The
creditors would make away with his estate and his daughter be left a
beggar We could see but one way of his preventing this and that was to
insure his life in his daughters favour We instituted inquiries at the
insurance offices and found that less than a month ago he had taken out
policies in various companies aggregating nearly fifty thousand dollars
whereas up to that time he had been carrying only two thousand dollars
insurance Why this sudden and tremendous increase Clearly to provide
for his daughter after his act should have deprived her of his own
watchful care And now we can plainly see why he wished his suicide to
pass for murder He had been insured but a month and immediate ruin
stared him in the face His death must be consummated at once and yet
by our law a man who takes his life before the payment of his second
annual insurance premium relieves the company issuing his policy of all
liability thereunder and robs his beneficiary of the fund intended for
her Here then is a sufficient motive and nothing more is required
to make the whole case perfectly clear Of course it would be a little
more complete if we could find the weapon but even without it there
can be no doubt in the light of our work that John Darrow took his
own life with the intentions and for the purposes I have already set
forth

Upon my soul gentlemen exclaimed Maitland you have reasoned that
out well Did you carefully read the copies of the various policies
when interrogating the companies insuring Mr Darrow Hardly Osborne
replied We learned from the officials all we needed to know and
didnt waste any time in gratifying idle curiosity A longdrawn
hmm was the only reply Maitland vouchsafed to this We regret
said Osborne addressing Gwen that our duty which has compelled us to
establish the truth in this matter has been the means of depriving you
of the insurance money which your father intended for you Gwen bowed
and a slight enigmatical smile played for a moment about her lips
but she made no other reply and as neither Maitland nor I encouraged
conversation the two officers wished us a goodmorning and left the
house without further remark

I wish to ask you a few questions Maitland said to Gwen as soon as
the door had closed behind Osborne and his companion and I beg you
will remember that in doing so however personal my inquiries may seem
they have but one object in viewthe solution of this mystery I
have already had good proof of your singleness of purpose she replied
Only too gladly will I give you any information in my possession Until
this assassin is found and my fathers good name freed from the obloquy
which has been cast upon it my existence will be but a blankyes
worse it will be an unceasing torment for I know my fathers
spiritif the dead have power to return to this earthcan never rest
with this weight of shame upon it As she spoke these words the depth
of grief she had hitherto so well concealed became visible for a moment
and her whole frame shook as the expression of her emotion reacted upon
her The next instant she regained her old composure and said calmly

You see I have every reason to shed whatever light I can upon this dark
subject

Please then to answer my questions methodically and do not permit
yourself to reason why I have asked them What was your fathers age

Sixtytwo

Did he drink

No

Did he play cards

Yes

Poker

Yes and several other games

Was he as fond of them as of croquet

No nothing pleased him as croquet didnothing unless it were chess

Hum Do you play chess

Yes I played a good deal with father

What kind of a game did he play

I do not understand you He played a good game my father did not enjoy
doing anything that he could not do well

I mean to ask if his positions were steadily sustainedor if on
the other hand his manoeuvres were swift and what you might call
brilliant

I think you would call them brilliant

Hum How old are you

Twentytwo

Tell me your relations with your father

We were most constant companions My mothershe and my fatherthey
were not altogether companionablein short they were illmated
and being wise enough to find it out and having no desire to longer
embitter each others lives they agreed to separate when I was only
four They parted without the slightest illfeeling and I remained with
father He was very fond of me and would permit no one else to teach
me At seven I was drawing and painting under his guidance At eight
the violin was put into my hands and my studies in voice began In the
meantime father was most careful not to neglect my physical training
he taught me the use of Indian clubs and how to walk easily At eight
I could walk four miles an hour without fatigue The neighbours used to
urge that I be put to school but my father would replymany a time I
have heard him say ita childs brain is like a flower that blossoms
in perceptions and goes to seed in abstractions Correct concepts are
the raw material of reason Every desk in your school is an intellectual
loom which is expected to weave a sound fabric out of rotten raw
material While your children are wasting their fibre in memorising the
antique errors of classical thought my child is being fitted to perceive
new truths for herself It is needless to say his friends considered
these views altogether too radical But for all that I was never sent to
school My fathers library was always at my disposal and I was taught
how to use it We were constantly together and grew so into each
others lives that but her voice failed her and her eyes moistened
Maitland though he apparently did not notice her emotion so busy was
he in making notes quickly put a question which diverted her attention

Your father seemed last night to have a presentiment of some impending
calamity Was this a common experience

Of late yes He has told me some six or seven times of dreaming
the same dreamsa dream in which some assassin struck him out of the
darkness Did you at any of these times notice anything which might
now lead you to believe this fancied repetition was the result of any
mental malady

No

Was his description of the dreams always the same

No never were they twice alike save in the one particular of the
unseen assassin

Hum Did the impression of these dreams remain long with him

He never recovered from it and each dream only accentuated his
assurance that the experience was prophetic When once I tried to
dissuade him from this view he said to me Gwen it is useless I am
making no mistake When I am gone you will know why I am now so sureI
cannot tell you now it would only here he stopped short and
turning abruptly to me said with a fierceness entirely alien to his
disposition Hatred is foreign to my nature but I hate that man with a
perfect hell of loathing Have I been a kind father to you Gwen If
so promise me and he seized me by the wrist promise me if Im
murderedI may as well say when Im murderedyou will look upon the
man who brings my assassin to justicethe thought that he may escape is
damningas your dearest friend on earth You will deny him nothing
You will learn later that I have taken care to reward him My child you
will owe this man a debt you can never repay for he will have enabled
your fathers soul to find repose I dreamed last night that I came back
from the dead and heard my avenger ask you to be his wife You
refused and at your ingratitude my restless soul returned to torment
everlasting Swear to me Gwen that youll deny him nothing
nothing nothing I promised him and he seemed much reassured I am
satisfied he said and now can die in peace for you are an anomaly
Gwena woman who fully knows the nature of a covenant and he put his
arm about me and drew me to him His fierceness had subsided as quickly
as it had appeared and he was now all tenderness

Maitland who appeared somewhat agitated by her recital said to her
After the exaction of such a promise you have of course no doubt that
your father was the victim of a mental maladyat least at such times
as those of which you speak

Gwen replied deliberately Indeed I have grave doubts My father
was possessed by a strange conviction but I never saw anything which
impressed me as indicating an unsound mind I am of course scarcely
fitted to judge in such matters

Maitlands face darkened as he asked You would not have me infer that
you would consider your promise in any sense binding

And why not she ejaculated in astonishment

Because he continued the request is so unnatural as to be in itself
sufficient evidence that it was not made by a man in his right mind

I cannot agree with you as to my fathers condition Gwen replied
firmly yet you may be right I only know that I at least was in
my right mind and that I promised If it cost me my life to keep
that pledge I shall not hesitate a moment Have you forgotten that my
fathers last words were remember your promise She glanced up
at Maitland as she said this and started a little as she saw the
expression of pain upon his face I seem to you foolishly deluded she
said apologetically and you are displeased to see that my purpose is
not shaken Think of all my father was to me and then ask yourself if
I could betray his faith The contemplation of the subject is painful at
best its realisation may from the standpoint of a sensitive woman
be fraught with unspeakable horrorI dare not think of it May we not
change the subject

For a long time Maitland did not speak and I forbore to break the
silence At last he said Let us hope if the supposed assassin
be taken the discovery may be made by someone worthy the name of
mansomeone who will not permit you to sacrifice either yourself or
your money Gwen glanced at him quickly for his voice was strangely
heavy and inelastic and an unmistakable gloom had settled upon him I
thought she was a little startled and I was considering if I had not
better call her aside and explain that he was subject to these moods
when he continued apparently unaware of the impression he had made Do
you realise how strong a case of suicide the authorities have made out
Like all of their work it has weak places We must search these in order
to overthrow their conclusion The insurance policies they were too
busy to read we must peruse Then judging from your story there
seems little doubt that your father has left some explanation of affairs
hitherto not confided to yousome document which he has reserved for
your perusal after his death No time should be lost in settling this
question The papers may be here or in the hands of his attorney Let
us search here first

His private papers Gwen said rising to lead the way are in his
desk in the study

One moment please Maitland interrupted calling her back I have
something I have been trying to ask you for the last hour but have
repeatedly put off I believe your fathers death to have resulted
from poisoning You know the result of the postmortem inquest It is
necessary to make an analysis of the poison if there be any and an
absolutely thorough microscopic examination of the wound II regret to
pain youbut to do this properly it will be necessary to cut away the
wounded portion Have we your permission to do so

For a moment Gwen did not answer She fell upon her knees before her
fathers body and kissed the cold face passionately For the first
time since the tragedy she found relief in tears When she arose a
great change had come over her She was very pale and seized a chair
for support as she replied to Maitlands question between the convulsive
sobs which she seemed powerless to check II have bidden him
goodbye We shall but obey his command in sparing no pains to reach the
assassin Youyou have my permission to do anythingeverythingthat
may benecessary to that end II know you will be as gentle But
she could not finish her sentence The futility of gentlenessthe
realisation that her father was forever past all need of tenderness
fell like a shroud about her soul The awakening I had dreaded had come
Her hand fell from the chair she staggered and would have fallen to
the floor had not Maitland caught her in his arms





THE EPISODE OF THE SEALED DOCUMENT



CHAPTER 1


 Father of all surveyors Time drags his chain of rust through
 every life and only Loveunaging God of the Agesimmeasurable
 keeps his untarnished youth

Maitland carried the unconscious girl into the study and for some
time we busied ourselves in bringing her to herself When this task was
accomplished we did not feel like immediately putting any further tax
upon her strength Maitland insisted that she should rest while he and
I ransacked the desk and ever mindful of her promise to obey his
instructions she yielded without remonstrance Our search revealed the
insurance policies and a sealed envelope bearing the inscription To
Miss Gwen Darrow to be opened after the death of John Darrow and
three newspapers with articles marked in blue pencil I read the first
aloud It ran as follows

I have reason to believe an attempt will sooner or later be made upon
my life and that the utmost cunning will be employed to lead the
authorities astray The search for the assassin will be long expensive
and discouragingjust such a task as is never successfully completed
without some strong personal incentive This I propose to supply in
advance My death will place in my daughters hands a fund of fifty
thousand dollars to be held in trust by her and delivered in the
event of my being murdered to such person or persons as shall secure
evidence leading to the conviction of the murderer

Signed JOHN HINTON DARROW


I glanced at the other two papersthe marked article was the same in
each I wonder what your friend Osborne would say to that I said to
Maitland

How old are the papers he replied

March 15thonly a little over a month I answered

Let me see them please he said Hum All of the same date and each
in the paid part of the paper It is clear Mr Darrow inserted these
singular notices himself I will tell you what Osborne will say when he
learns of these articles He will say they strengthen his theory that
no sane man would publish such a thing except as a weak attempt to
deceive the insurance companies As for the money all being paid to the
discoverer of the assassin instead of to his daughter he will simply
dispose of that by saying No assassin no reward and the fund remains
intact If now the other papers permit Miss Darrow to use the interest
of this fund while holding the principal in trust we do not at present
know enough of this matter to successfully refute Osbornes reasoning
This mystery seems to grow darker rather than lighter The one thing
upon which we seem continually to get evidence is the question of
sanity If Mr Darrows suspicions were directed against no one in
particular then it is clear his dreams and all the rest of his fears
for that matter had a purely subjective origin which is to say that
upon this one subject at least he was of unsound mind

I cannot think so Gwen interrupted He was so rational in everything
else

That is quite possible I replied I have known people to be
monomaniacs upon the subject of water and to go nowhere without a glass
of it in their hands There is also a wellauthenticated case of a man
who was as sane as you or I until he heard the words real estate One
day while quietly carving the meat at a dinner to which he had invited
several guests a gentleman opposite him inadvertently spoke the fatal
words when without a word of warning he sprang at him across the
table using the carvingknife with all the fury of the most violent
maniac and yet under all other conditions he was perfectly rational

If on the other hand said Maitland continuing his remarks as if
unaware of our interruption Mr Darrows suspicions had any foundation
in fact it is almost certain they must have been directed against
some specific person or persons If so why did he not name thembut
stayhow do we know that he did not Let us proceed with our
examination of the papers and he began perusing the insurance
policies Neither Gwen nor I spoke till he had finished and thrown them
down when we both turned expectantly toward him

All in Osbornes favour so far he said Principal to be held in
trust by Miss Darrow under the terms of a will which we have yet to
find the income until the discharge of the trust to go to Miss
Darrow Now for this and he passed Gwen the sealed envelope addressed
to her

She broke the seal with much agitation Shall I read it aloud she
asked

We signified our desire to hear it and she read as follows

MY DEAR GWEN

My forebodings have seemed to you strange and uncalled for but
when this comes to your hand you will know whether or not they were
groundless Of one episode in my career which shook the structure of
my being to its foundation stone you have been carefully kept in
ignorance It is necessary that you should know it when I am gone and
I have accordingly committed it to this paper which will then fall into
your hands My early life until two years after I married your mother
was spent in India the adult portion thereof being devoted to the
service of the East India Company I had charge of a department in their
depot at Bombay You have seen Naples Add to the beauties of that city
the interesting and motley population of Cairo and you can form some
idea of the attractions of Bombay I was very happy there until the
occurrence of the event I am about to narrate

One morning my duties calling me to one of the wharves my attention
was attracted by a young girl dancing upon the flags by the waters
edge The ordinary bayadere is so common an object in India as to
attract but little notice from anyone of refined tastes but this girl
judging from the chaste beauty of her movements was of a very different
type As my curiosity drew me nearer to her she turned her face toward
me and in that instant I knew my hour had come

Though many years her senior she was still my first lovethe one great
passion of my life

I do not attempt to describe her ineffable loveliness for like the
beauty of a flower it was incapable of analysis Nothing that I could
write would give you any adequate idea of this girls seraphic face for
she was like unto no one you have ever seen in this cold Western world
I watched in a wild nervous transport I know not how longtime and
space had no part in this new ecstasy of mine I could think of nothing
do nothingonly feelfeel the hot blood deluge my brain only to fall
back in scalding torrents upon my heart with a pain that was exquisite
pleasure

Suddenly she changed her step and executed a quick backward movement
toward the water stopping just as her heels touched the curb at
the edge of the wharf then forward and again a quick return to the
backward movement but this time she mistook the distance her heels
struck the curb forcibly and she was precipitated backward into the
water For a moment I stood as one petrified unable to reason much
less to act then the excited voices of the crowd recalled me They had
thrown a rope into the water and were waiting for her to come to the
surface and grasp it The wall from which she had fallen must have been
at least fifteen feet above the water which was littered with broken
spars pieces of timber and other odd bits of wood It seemed as if she
would never come to the surface and when at length she did she did not
attempt to seize the rope thrown to her but sank without a movement
The truth flashed upon me in an instant She had struck her head against
some of the floating drift and was unconscious Something must be done
at once I seized the rope and sprang in after her taking good care to
avoid obstructions and although as you know I never learned to swim
I succeeded in reaching her and we were drawn up together I bore her
in my arms into one of the storerooms close by and laying her upon a
bale of cotton used such restoratives as could be quickly procured

I was kneeling by her my arm under her neck in the act of raising her
head when she opened her eyes and fastened them full of wonderment
upon my face A moment more her memory returning to her she made a
little movement as if to free herself I was too excited then to heed
it and continued to support her head She did not repeat the movement
but half closed her eyes and leaned back resignedly against my arm
If I thought these few minutes could be expanded into an eternity
it would be my idea of heaven She was recovering rapidly now and soon
raised herself into a sitting posture saying in very good English I
think I can stand now Sahib I gave her my arm and assisted her to her
feet Her hand closed upon my sleeve as if to see how wet it was and
glancing at my dripping garments she said simply You have been in the
water Sahib and it is to you I owe my life I shall never forget your
kindness She raised her eyes to my face and met my gaze for a moment
as she spoke We are told that the eye is incapable of any expression
save that lent it by the lids and browthat the eyeball itself
apart from its direction and the changes of the pupil resulting from
variations in the intensity of light can carry no message whatsoever
This may be so but without any noticeable movement of the eyes that
met mine I learned with ineffable delight that this young girls soul
and mine were threaded upon the same cord of destiny My emotion so
overpowered me that I could not speak and when my selfpossession
returned the young girl had vanished

From the height of bliss I now plunged into the abyss of despair I had
let her go without a word I did not even know her name I had caught
her to myself from the ocean only to suffer her to drown herself among
the halfmillion inhabitants of Bombay What must she think of me I
asked the wharfinger if he knew her but he had never seen her before
All my other inquiries proved equally fruitless I wondered if she
knew that I loved her but hardly dared to hope she had been able to
correctly interpret my boorish conduct I could think of but one thing
to do If I did not know her name neither did she know mine and so if
she desired a further acquaintance she like myself must rely upon a
chance meeting If she had detected my admiration for her she must
know that I too would strive to meet her again Where would she be most
likely to expect me to look for her Clearly at the same place we had
met before and at the same time of day She might naturally think my
duties called me there daily at that hour I determined to be there at
the same time the next day

I arrived to find her there before me anxiously peering at the
passersby She was certainly looking for methere was ecstasy in the
thought

It is not necessary my dear child that I should describe the details
of our lovemaking for my present purpose is not merely to interest
you but rather to acquaint you with certain occurrences which I now
deem it wise you should know Time only intensified our love for each
other and for several months all went well One serious obstacle to
our union presented itselfthat of caste Her people Lona said would
never permit her to marry outside her own station in life besides which
there was another ground upon which we might be equally sure of their
opposition They had already chosen for her and she was betrothed to
Rama Ragobah It is of this man that I have chiefly to speak By birth
he was of the same Vaisya caste as Lona Early in life his lot had
fallen among fakirs and he had acquired all their secrets This did not
satisfy his ambitions for he wished to be numbered among the rishis or
adepts and subjected himself to the most horrible asceticism to qualify
himself for adeptship His indifference to physical pain was truly
marvellous He had rolled his naked body to the Ganges over hundreds of
miles of burning sands He had held his hands clinched until the nails
had worn through the palm and out at the back of the hand He had at one
time maintained for weeks a slow fire upon the top of his head keeping
the skin burned to the skull

When he came wooing Lona his rigid asceticism had much relaxed but he
would still seek to amuse her by driving knives into his body until
she would sicken at the blood a condition of affairs which she said
afforded him great enjoyment Ragobah was a man of gigantic build and
immense physical strength His features were heavy and forbidding You
are familiar with pictures of Nana Sahib If I had not known this fiend
to have died while beset in a swamp I should have mistaken Ragobah
for him It was to such a being that Lona was betrothed in spite of the
loathing her parents knew she felt for him She told me all this one
night at our accustomed tryst on Malabar Hill We had chosen to meet
here on account of the beauty of the place and the seclusion it offered
There on bright moonlit nights with the sea and the city below me
the Tower of Silence in the Parsees burial plot ablaze with reflected
glory the majestic banyan over me rustling gently in the soft sea
breeze while Lona nestled close beside methe exquisite perfume of
the luxuriant garden less welcome than the delicious fragrance of
her breathhours fraught with years of bliss would pass as if but
pulsebeats In the world of love the heart is the only true timepiece
On one or two occasions Lona had thought she had been followed when
coming to meet me and she began to conceive a strange dislike for a
little cavelike recess in the rocks just back of the tree by which we
sat I tried on one occasion to reassure her by telling her it was so
shallow that with the moonlight streaming into it I could see clear
to the back wall and arose to enter it to convince her there was no one
there but she clung to me in terror saying Dont go Dont leave me
I was foolish to mention it I cannot account for my fearand yet do
you know she continued in a low frightened tone there is a shaft
at the back of the cave that has they say no bottom but goes
downdowndownhundreds of feet to the sea It is useless as
you know only too well to strive to reason down a presentiment and so
instead I sought to make use of her fear in the accomplishment of my
dearest wish Why need we I urged come here why longer continue
these clandestine meetings Let us be brave darling in our loves Your
people have chosen another husband for youmy people another wife for
me but we are both quite able to choose for ourselves We have done so
and it is our most sacred duty to adhere to and consummate that choice
Let us I beseech you do so without further delay Dearest meet me
here tomorrow night prepared for a journey We will take the late train
for Matheron Station where I have friends who can be trusted We will
be married immediately upon our arrival and can communicate by post
with our respective families remaining away from them until they are
glad to welcome us with open arms

She raised some few objections to my plan and expressed some misgivings
but she loved me and I was able to reason away the one and kiss away
the other and with our souls upon our lips we parted for the night
The last thing I had said to herI remember it as if it all happened
yesterdaywas Think of it dear heart there will be no more such
partings between us after tonight and she had replied by silently
nestling closer to me and twining her arms about my neck And so we
parted on that nevertobeforgotten night more than a score of years
ago

The twentyfour hours intervening between this parting and our next
meeting may be passed over in silence as nothing occurred during that
time at all essential to the purpose this narrative subserves The
longedfor time came at last and with a depth of happiness I had never
known beforea peace passing all understandingI set out for Malabar
Hill The night was perfect and the moonlight so bright I could
distinctly see the airroots of our trysting tree when more than a
quarter of a mile away I thought at the time how this tree with its
crown of luxuriant foliage and its writhing roots might well pass for
some gigantic Medusahead with its streaming serpenthair As I neared
the tree Lona stepped from behind it and awaited my approach She was
even more impatient than I I thought and my heart beat more wildly
than ever Sweet saint have I kept you waiting I asked as I came
within speaking distance of her She stood motionless against the tree
and apparently did not hear me I waited till I was within ten feet of
her and repeated the question but although she fixed her unfathomable
eyes full upon mine she made no reply and gave no evidence of having
heard me I stood as if petrified A nameless dread was settling upon
me paralysing my faculties She had always before sprung forward at
sight of me and thrown herself with a bewitching little pirouette into
my arms now she stood coldly aloof silent and motionless on this our
wedding night I waited for some word of explanation but none came The
suspense became unbearableI could endure it no longer

For Gods sake what has happened I cried rushing forward to seize
her in my arms She raised her right hand above her head and as I had
almost reached her threw something full in my face Instinctively
I struck at it with my walkingstick and it fell in the grass at my
feetit was a young Indian cobraNaja tripudiansa serpent of the
deadliest sort I did not pause to reason how this sweet angel had been
so quickly changed into a venomous fiend although the thought that
somehow she had been led to think me false to her and that this act
was the swift vengeance of her hot Eastern blood flashed momentarily
through my mindall that could be explained as soon as I had her
nestling in my arms I reached forward to embrace her but she struck me
in the face and fled For an instant my heart stood still It seemed to
me it would never start but it soon began to throb again like a thing
of lead and the blood it pumped was cold for the winter had closed
in upon it The elasticity of my life that ineffable resiliency of the
soul which makes us more than beasts of burden was gone forever An
automaton informed only with the material life remainedthe spirit
followed that fleeting figure down the hill More than twenty years have
passed and still the unrewarded chase continues

But it is to facts I have to call your attention rather than to their
effects A flutter of white muslin in the moonlit distance was all that
was visible of the retreating girl when I started mechanically and
without any particular purpose in view in pursuit of her My path lay
by the banyan tree under which we had so often sat but every airroot
seemed changed to a writhing serpent As I threaded my way among them a
man stepped from behind the trunk and disputed my passage His gigantic
form was silhouetted against the mass of rock forming the entrance to
the little cave The bright moonlight did what it could to illumine that
sinister face It was Rama Ragobah For fully a minute we stood silently
face to face each expecting the assault of the other It was Ragobah
who spoke first She is mine body and soul and the English cur may
find a mate in his own kennel He bent toward me and hissed these words
in my very face His hot breath seemed to poison me It made me beside
myself I knew he meant to take advantage of his physical superiority
and attack me by the narrow watch he kept upon the heavy walkingstick
I still carried in my right hand He had expected I would attempt to
strike with this but my constant practice at boxing had made my fists
the more natural weapon I was so enraged I did not notice he was too
close to use my stick to advantage I simply acted without any thought
whatever His attitude was such as he hissed his venom into my face as
to enable me to give him a powerful upper cut under the jaw This
as I was so much lighter than he was the most effective blow I could
deliver yet although it took him off his feet it did not disable him
I had not succeeded in placing it as I had intended and it had only the
effect of rendering him demoniacal In an instant he was again upon his
feet and unsheathing a long knife I knew it meant death for me if he
were able to close with me It was useless for me to call for help for
in those days this part of Malabar Hill was as deserted as a wilderness
Now the very spot on which we stood is highly cultivated and forms a
part of the garden of the Blasehek villa There early in the eighties
as the guest of the hospitable Herr Blasehek Professor Ernst Haeckel
botanised a week on his way to Ceylon Now in response to a cry from
his intended victim an assassin might be frustrated by assistance from
a dozen bungalows but at the time of which I write the victim if he
were wise saved his breath for the struggle which he knew he must make
unaided

Ragobah paused and coolly bared his right arm to the elbow There was
a studied deliberation in his movements which said only too plainly
There is no hurry in killing you for you cannot escape I grasped my
stick firmly as my only hope and awaited his onslaught My early mili
 my life Without the knowledge which I had derived from the use of
the broadsword I should have been all but certain to have attempted
to strike him a downward blow upon the head This is just what he was
expecting and it would have cost me my life He would have had only to
throw up his left arm to catch the blow while with his right hand he
plunged the knife into my heart My experience had taught me how much
easier it is to protect ones self from a cutting blow than from a
thrust and I determined to adopt this latter means of assault Ragobah
advanced upon me slowly much as a cat steals upon an unsuspecting bird
I raised my stick as if to strike him and he instinctively threw up his
left arm and advanced upon me My opportunity had come I lowered the
point of my cane to the level of his face and made a vigorous lunge
forward throwing my whole weight upon the thrust As nearly as I could
tell the point of my stick caught him in the socket of the left
eye just as he sprang forward and hurled him backward blinded and
stupefied Before he had recovered sufficiently to protect himself I
dealt him a blow upon the head that brought him quickly to the earth
Without stopping to ascertain whether or not I had killed him I fled
precipitately to my lodgings hastily packed my belongings and set out
for Matheron Station by the same train I had so fondly believed would
convey Lona and me to our nuptial altar Words cannot describe the
suffering I endured upon that journey For the first time since my
terrible desertion I had an opportunity to think and I did think if
the pulse of an overwhelming pain perpetually recurring like the beat
of a loaded wheel can be called thought Although there is no insanity
in our family nearer than a greatuncle I marvel that I retained my
wits under this terrible blow I seriously contemplated suicide and
probably should have taken my life had not my mental condition gradually
undergone a change I was no longer conscious of suffering nor of a
desire to end my life I was simply indifferent It was all one to me
whether I lived or died The power of loving or caring for anything
or anybody had entirely left me and when I would reflect how utterly
indifferent I was even to my own father and mother I would regard
myself as an unnatural monster I tried to conceal my lack of affection
by a greater attention to their wishes and it was in this way that
I yielded without remonstrance to those same views regarding my
marriage to which but a little while before I had made such strenuous
objections as to quite enrage my father I was an only child and as
often happens in such cases my father never could be brought to realise
that I had many years since attained my majority It had been his wish
ever since my boyhood that I should marry your mother and he made use
when I was nearly forty of the selfsame insistent and coercive methods
with which he had sought to subdue my will when I was but twenty and at
last he attained his end I had learned from friends in Bombay that
not only had Rama Ragobah recovered from the blows I had given him but
that shortly after my encounter with him he had married Lona she whom
I had loved God only knows how madly It was all one to me now whether
I was married or single living or dead So it was all arranged I
myself told the lady that so far as I then understood my feelings I
had no affection for any person on earth but it seemed only to pique
her and I think she determined then and there to make herself an
exception to this universal rule This is how I came to marry your
mother There was not the slightest community of thought sentiment or
interest between us The things I liked did not interest her what she
liked bored me yet she was preeminently a sensible woman and when she
learned the real state of affairs was the first to suggest a separation
which was effected We parted with the kindliest feelings and as you
know remained fast friends up to her death

It was nearly a year after the affair on Malabar Hill before I had the
heart to return with your mother to Bombay I had thought all emotion
forever dead within me but ah how little do we understand ourselves
Twelve months had not passed and already I was conscious of a vague
achea feeling that something I scarcely knew what had gone wrong
so terribly wrong I told myself that I was now married and had a duty
both to my wife and society and I tried hard to ignore the ache on
the one hand and not to permit myself to define and analyse it on the
other But a man does not have to understand anatomy in order to break
his heart and so my longing defined itself even by itself The old
fire built on a virgin hearth was far from out Society had heaped
a mouthful of conventional ashes upon it but they had served only
to preserve it From the fiat of the human heart there is no court of
appeal

One night to my utter amazement I received a letter from Lona which
you will find filed away among my other valuable documents

It was addressed in her own quaint little hand and I trembled violently
as I opened the envelope It was but a brief note and ran as follows

I am dying and have much to explain before I go Be generous and do
not think too harshly of me Suspend your judgment until I have spoken
You must come by stealth or you will not be permitted to see me Follow
my directions carefully and you will have no trouble in reaching me Go
at once to the cave on Malabar Hill whistle thrice and one will appear
who will conduct you safely to me Follow him and whatever happens
make no noise Do not delayI can last but little longer

LONA

I did not even pause to reread the letter or to ask why it was
necessary to follow such singular directions in order to be led to her
I simply knew she had written to me that she was dying that she
wanted me that was all but it was enough Dazed filled with a strange
mixture of dread and yearning I hurried to the cave It was already
night when I reached itjust such a moonlit night as that on which
nearly a year before Lona and I had planned our elopement and now
that heart which then had beaten so wildly against mine was slowly
throbbing itself into eternal silenceand II had been more than dead
ever since

I looked about on all sides but no human being was visible I whistled
thrice but no sound came in response Again I whistled with the same
result Where was my guide Perhaps he was in the cave and had not heard
me I entered it to see but had barely passed the narrow portal when
a voice said close behind me Did you whistle Sahib The suddenness
the strangeness of this uncanny appearance so close to me that I felt
the breath of the words upon my neck sent a chill over me I shall
never forget that feeling Many times since then have I dreamt of a hand
that struck me from out the darkness while the same unspeakable dread
froze up my life until by repetition it has sunk deep into my soul
with the weight of a positive conviction I know as I now write that
this will be my end and his will be the hand that strikes The fibre of
our lives is twisted in a certain way and each has its own fixed mode
of unravellingthis will be mine

When I had recovered from the first momentary shock I turned and looked
behind me There close upon me with his huge form blocking the narrow
entrance stood Rama Ragobah my rival his face hideous with malignant
triumph I was trapped and that too by a man whom my hatred could
it have worked its will would have plunged into the uttermost hell of
torment I felt sure my hour had come but my assassin should not have
the satisfaction of thinking I feared him I did not permit myself to
betray the slightest concern as to my positionindeed after the shock
of the first surprise I did not care so very much what fate awaited me
Why should I Had I not seriously thought of taking my own life Was it
not clear now that Lona whose own handwriting had decoyed me had most
basely betrayed me into her husbands hands If I had wished to end my
own life before surely now death at the hands of another was no very
terrible thing Could I have dragged that other down with me I would
have rejoiced at the prospect

Ragobah broke the silence You have left your stick this time I see
he said as he unsheathed the long knife I had once before escaped and
ostentatiously felt its edge as if he were about to shave with it

You were in haste Sahib when you left me last time or I should not
now have the pleasure of this interview Be assured I shall do my work
more thoroughly this time Behind you there is a hole partly filled with
water If you drop a stone into this well it is several seconds
before you hear the splash and there is a saying hereabouts that it is
bottomless I am curious to know if this be true and I am going to send
you to see Of course if the story is well founded I shall not expect
you to come back That would be unreasonable Sahib

All this was said with a refined sarcasm which maddened me and as
he concluded he began to edge stealthily toward me So strong is the
instinct of selfpreservation within us that I doubt not a wouldbe
suicide caught in the act of hanging himself would struggle madly for
his life were someone else to forcibly adjust the noose about his neck
At all events I found myself unwilling at the last moment to have
someone else launch me into eternity and as I wished to gain time to
think what I should do to escape I said to him

Why do you bear me such malice Can you not see that any injury I may
have done you was purely in selfdefence You sought the quarrel and I
took the only means at hand to protect myself I did not as you know
seek to kill you a thing I could easily have done but was content
merely to make good my escape I

Bah he said interrupting me savagely That has nothing to do with
it Had you only pounded my head you might live but you have pounded my
heart It is for that I hate you and for that you die

What have I done I asked

What have you done he roared furious with rage I will tell you
You have by magic possessed the mind of my wife Your name your cursed
name is ever upon her lips My entreaties my supplications are answered
by nothing else Even in her sleep she starts up and calls for you You
have cast a spell upon her Day by day she droops and withers like a
lotusflower whose root is severed yet ever and always is your
cursed name upon her lips goading me to madness until at last I have
registered a sacred oath to kill you and remove the accursed spell you
have thrown upon her

Had he advanced upon me at this moment he would have found me as
helpless as a child so overcome was I by the sudden joy which seized
upon me and seemed to turn my melancholy inside out Those words of
hatred had been as a torch illumining the gloom of my despair for
they had shown me that my existence was not altogether barren and
unproductive The life which has known the heaven of true love cannot
be called a failure There is no wall so high no distance so great no
separation so complete as to defy the ineffable commerce of two loving
hearts Lona then was still mine despite all obstacles What a
change this knowledge made In an instant life became an inexpressible
benefaction for it permitted me to realise I was belovedand death
was dowered with a new horrorthe fear that I should cease to know it

I was roughly aroused from my reflections by Rama Ragobah

Come Sahib he said as his thick lips curled sneeringly suppose
you try your spells upon me You will never have a better chance than
now to show your power and again he made a slight movement toward me
with the gleaming knife The moon low down upon the horizon sent a
broad beam of light into the entrance of the cave and over the head and
shoulders of the Indian Its cold light shimmered along the blade which
was now held threateningly toward me The crisis had been reached

In times of such great urgency one has frequently an
inspirationinstantaneous disconnected unbiddenwhich no amount of
quiet peaceful thought would suggest Such extraordinary flashes are
the result of reasoning too rapid for consciousness to note The Indian
had already laid bare his right arm to the elbow before I had determined
upon the desperate course I would pursue and upon which I must hazard
all As he advanced upon me I seized the large white sola hat from my
head and hurled it full in his face It was a schoolboy trick yet upon
its success depended my life Instinctively and in spite of himself
Ragobah dodged closed his eyes and raised his right hand knife and
all to shield his face I sprang upon him at the same instant I threw
my hat and so was able to reach him before he opened his eyes I had
well calculated his movements and had made no mistake As I reached him
his head was bent downward and forward to let the hat pass over him His
position could not have been better for my purpose I swung on him as
we used to say at the gymnasium catching him under his protruded jaw
not far from the region of the carotid artery The blow was well placed
and desperation lent me phenomenal strength It raised him bodily
off his feet and hurled him backward out of the cave where he lay
motionless He was now in my power I seized his knife and bent over
him Words cannot express the hatred the loathing I felt for him then
and always Between me and the light of my happiness he had ever stood
an impenetrable black mass Twice had he sought my life yet now when
he was in my power I could not plunge his weapon into his heart Would
it not be just I thought to drag him into the cave and hurl him down
the abyss he had intended for me Yes he certainly merited it yet I
could not do that either I wished the snake a thousand times dead yet
I could not stamp it into the earth

He was beginning to slightly move now and something must be done It
was useless to run for the way was long and he could easily overtake
me You may wonder why I did not take to the thicket but if you had
ever had any experience with Indian jungles you would know that without
the use of fire and axe they are practically impenetrable Professor
Haeckel botanising near that same spot spent an hour in an endeavour
to force his way into one of these jungles but only succeeded in
advancing a few steps into the thicket when stung by mosquitoes
bitten by ants his clothing torn from his bleeding arms and legs
wounded by the thousands of sharp thorns of the calamus hibiscus
euphorbias lantanas and myriad other jungle plants he was obliged
utterly discomfited to desist If this were the result of his efforts
made in broad daylight and with deliberation what might I expect
rushing into the thicket at night as a refuge from a pursuer far my
superior in physical strength and fleetness of foot and who moreover
had known the jungle from his boyhood Once overtaken by my enemy the
long knife in my hands would be of no avail against a stick in his
I saw all this clearly and realised that he must be prevented from
following me

There was no time to be lost for he was rapidly recovering possession
of his powers I seized a large rock and hurled it with all the force I
could command upon his left foot and ankle Notwithstanding his immense
strength his hands and feet were scarcely larger than a womans and the
small bones cracked like pipestems Though I had not the will to kill
him my own safety demanded that I should maim him as the only other
means of making good my escape As the rock crushed his foot the pain
seemed to bring him immediately into full possession of his faculties
and he roared like an enraged bull I turned and looked back as I beat
a hasty retreat down the hill He had seized one of the airroots of the
banyan tree and raised himself upon his right leg The expression
of his face as the moonlight fell upon it was something never to be
forgotten It riveted me to the spot with the fascination of horror
He shook his fist at me fiercely as he shrieked from the back of his
throat

You infidel cur You may as well try to brush away the Himalyas with
a silk handkerchief as to escape the wrath of Rama Ragobah Go Bury
yourself in seclusion at the farthermost corner of the earth and on one
night Ragobah and the darkness shall be with you

These were the last words this fiend incarnate ever spoke to me but I
know they are prophetic and that he will keep his oath

The next day I learned that Lona was dead She had died with my name
upon her lips and her secretthe explanation of her strange conduct on
that nightdied with her I shall never know it Bitterly did I repent
my inability to reach her The thought that she had waited in vain for
me that with her last breath she had called upon me and I had answered
not was unendurable torture and I fled India and came to America in
the futile endeavour to forget it all Out of my black past there shone
but one bright starher love All these long years have I oriented my
soul by that sweet unforgettable radiance prizing it above a galaxy of
lesser joys

There is little more to be said I shall meet death as I have statedI
am sure of itand no man will see the blow given Remember as I loved
that Indian maiden with a passion which death has not chilled so I
loathe my rival with a hatred infinite and allconsuming for somehow
I know that demon crushed out the life of my fragile lotusflower He
will work his will upon me but if his cunning enable him to escape the
gallows my soul if there be a conscious hereafter will never rest
in peace Remember this my dear child and your promise that God may
bless you even as I bless you

It was some time after Gwen had finished this interesting document
before any of us spoke The narrative and the peculiar circumstances
under which it had been read deeply impressed us At length Maitland
said in a subdued voice as if he feared to break some spell

The Indian girls letter let us find that and also the will

Gwen went to the drawer in which her father kept his private papers
and soon produced them both Maitland glanced hastily at the letter and
said You have already heard its contents then turning to Gwen he
said I will keep it with your permission Now for the will It was
handed to him and his face fell as he read it In a moment he turned
to us and said The interest on the insurance money is to go to Miss
Darrow the entire principal to be held in trust and paid to the person
bringing the assassin to justice unless said person shall wed Miss
Darrow in which case half of the fund shall go to the husband and
the other half to the wife in her own right The balance of the estate
which by the way is considerable despite the reports given to
Osborne is to go to Miss Darrow This is all the will contains having
any bearing upon the case in hand Let us proceed with the rest of the
papers We made a long and diligent search but nothing of importance
came to light When we had finished Maitland said

Our friend Osborne would say the document we have just perused made
strongly for his theory and was simply another fabrication to blind the
eyes of the insurance company Thats what comes of wedding ones self
to a theory founded on imperfect data

And what do you think Gwen inquired

That Rama Ragobah has small hands and feet he replied That his left
foot has met with an injury and is probably deformed that most likely
he is lame in the left leg that he had the motive for which we have
been looking that he may or may not have the habit of biting his nails
that he is crafty and that if he were to do murder it is almost
certain his methods would be novel and surprising as well as extremely
difficult to fathomin short that suspicion points unmistakably to
Rama Ragobah That is easily said but to bring the deed home to him
is quite another thing I shall analyse the poison of the wound and
microscopically examine the nature of the abrasion this afternoon
Tonight I take the midnight train for New York Tomorrow I shall sail
for Bombay via London and the Continent I will keep you informed of
my address While I am away I would ask that you close the house here
leaving everything just as it is now dismiss the servants and take up
your abode with the Doctor and his sister He rose to go as he said
this and then continued as he turned to me I shall depend upon you
to look after Miss Darrows immediate interests in my absence I knew
this meant that I was to guard her health not permitting her to be much
by herself and I readily acquiesced

The look of amazement which had at first overspread Gwens face at
the mention of this precipitate departure gave place to one of modest
concern as she said softly to Maitland Is it necessary that you
should encounter the dangers of such a journey to say nothing of the
time and inconvenience it will cost He looked down at her quickly and
then said reassuringly Do you know one is by actual statistics safer
in an English railway carriage than when walking the crowded streets
of London I am daily subjecting myself to laboratory dangers which
I believe are graver than any I am likely to meet between here and
Bombay or for that matter even at Bombay in the presence of our
recent acquaintance Ragobah

I deeply appreciate she replied the generous sacrifice you would
make in my interestsbut Bombay is such a long wayand

If suspicion directed me to the North Pole he interrupted I should
start with equal alacrity and he held out his hand to her to bid her
farewell She took it in a way that bespoke a world of gratitude if
nothing more He retained the small hand while he said Have you
forgotten my friend your promise to your father Do you not see in
what terrible relations it may place you How important then that no
effort should be spared to prevent you from becoming indebted to one
unmanly enough to take advantage of your position I shall use every
means within my power to myself discover your fathers murderer and
you may comfort yourself with the assurance that if successful I shall
make no demand of any kind whatsoever upon your gratitude I think you
understand me

As he said this Gwen looked him full in the face A little nervous
tremor seized the corners of her mouth and the tears sprang to her
eyes Goodbye was all she could say before she was compelled to turn
aside to conceal her emotion

Maitland observing her agitation said to her tenderly Your gratitude
for the little that I have already done is reward more than ample for
all I shall ever be able to do Goodbye and he left the room

Oh man with your microscope How is it that you find the smallest speck
of dust yet miss the mountain Does the time seem too short It would
not if you realised that events not clocks were the real measure
thereof




THE EPISODE OF RAMA RAGOBAH



CHAPTER I

 Life is but a poor accountant when it leaves the Future to
 balance its entries long years after the parties to the
 transactions are but a handful of insolvent dust When in such
 wise the chiefest item of one side of the sheet fails to explain
 itself to the other the tragic is attained

On the day following Maitlands departure for New York Mr Darrow was
buried The Osborne theory seemed to be universally accepted and
many women who had never seen Mr Darrow during his life attended his
funeral curious to see what sort of a person this suicide might be
Gwen bore the ordeal with a fortitude which spoke volumes for her
strength of character and I took good care when it was all over that
she should not be left alone In compliance with Maitlands request
whose will since her promise to him was law to her she prepared to
close the house and take up her abode with us

It was on the night of the funeral just after the lamps were lighted
that an event occurred which made a deep impression upon Gwen though
neither she nor I fully appreciated its significance till weeks
afterward

Gwen who was to close the house on the morrow was going from room to
room collecting such little things as she wished to take with her The
servants had been dismissed and she was entirely alone in the house
She had gathered the things she had collected in a little heap upon the
sittingroom table preparatory to doing them up She could think of but
one thing more which she must takea cabinet photograph of her father
This was upon the top of the piano in the room where he had met his
death She knew its exact location and could have put her hand right
upon it had it been perfectly dark which it was not She arose
therefore and without taking a light with her went into the parlour
A faint afterglow illumined the windows and suffused the room with an
uncertain dim ghostly light which lent to all its objects that vague
flatness from which the imagination carves what shapes it lists As
Gwen reached for the picture a sudden conviction possessed her that
her father stood just behind her in the exact spot where he had met
his deaththat if she turned she would see him again with his hand
clutching his throat and his eyes starting from their sockets with that
nevertobeforgotten look of frenzied helplessness

It would be difficult to find a woman upon whom superstition has so
slight a hold as it has upon Gwen Darrow yet for all that it required
an effort for her to turn and gaze toward the centre of the room A dim
illdefined stain of light fell momentarily upon the chair in which the
dead man had sat and then flickered unsteadily across the room and
as it seemed to her out through its western side the while a faint
rustling sound caught her ear She was plainly conscious too of a
something swishing by her as if a strong draught had just fallen upon
her She was not naturally superstitious as I have said before yet
there was something in the gloom the deserted house and this
fatal room with its untold story of death which added to her weird
perceptions and that indescribable conviction of an unseen presence
caused even Gwen to press her hand convulsively upon her throbbing
heart For the first time in her life the awful possibilities of
darkness were fully borne in upon her and she knew just how her father
had felt

In a moment however she had recovered from her first shock and had
begun to reason Might not the sound she had heard and the movement she
had felt both be explained by an open window She knew she had closed
and locked all the windows of the room when she had finished airing
it after the funeral and she was not aware that anyone had been there
since yet she said to herself that perhaps one of the servants had come
in and opened a window without her knowledge She turned and looked The
lower sash of the eastern windowthe one through which she felt sure
death had approached her fatherwas raised to its utmost

How fortunate she murmured that I discovered this before leaving

She was all but fully reassured now as she stepped to the window to
close it Remembering how the sash stuck in the casing she raised both
hands to forcibly lower it As she did so a strong arm caught the sash
from the outer side and a stalwart masculine form arose directly in
front of her His great height brought his head almost to a level with
her own despite the fact that he was standing upon the ground outside
He was so near that she could feel his breath upon her face His eyes
like two great coals of fire blazed into hers with a sinister and
threatening light His countenance seemed to utterly surpass any
personal malignancy and to exhibit itself as a type of all the hatreds
that ever poisoned human hearts

Only a moment before Gwen had felt a creepy sickening sensation
stealing over her as the result of an illdefined and apparently
causeless dread Now an actual imminent and fearful peril confronted
her Under such circumstances most women would have fainted and
indeed if Gwen had herself been asked how she would have acted under
such a supreme test she would have prophesied the same maidenly
course as her own yet in the real exigencyhow little do we know of
ourselves save what actual experience has taught usthis is precisely
what she did not do When the horrible apparition first rose in her very
face as it were a momentary weakness caught her and she clung to the
sash for support Then the wonderful fire of the malignant eyes green
serpentine opalescent with the wavelike flux of a glowworms light
seen under a glass riveted her attention She had ceased to tremble
Our fear of death varies with our desire for life Dulled by a great
grief she did not so very much care what became of her The futures
burden was heavy and if it were necessary she now put it down there
would still be a sense of relief As this thought passed like a shadow
over her consciousness she felt herself irresistibly attracted to the
awful face before her Her assailants gaze seemed to have wound itself
about her own till she could not disentangle it She was dimly conscious
that she was falling under a spell and summoned all her remaining
strength to break it Quick as the uncoiling of a released spring and
without the slightest movement of warning she threw her entire weight
upon the sash in a last endeavour to close the window but the mans
upraised arm held both her weight and it as if its muscles had been
rods of steel Gwen saw a long knife in his free handsaw the light
shimmer along its blade saw him raise it aloft to plunge it into her
bosom yet made no movement to withdraw beyond his reach and uttered no
cry for help It seemed to her that all this was happening to another
and that she herself was only a fascinated spectator She was wondering
whether or not the victim would try to defend herself when the knife
began its descent It seemed ages in its downward passageso long
indeed that it gave her time to think of most of the main experiences
of her life At last it paused irresolutely within an inch of her bosom
She wondered that the victim made no attempt to escape uttered no cry
for help Suddenly she felt something whirling and buzzing in her
brain while a wild fluttering filled both her ears then the swirling
fluttering torment rose in a swift and awful crescendo which seemed to
involve all creation in its vortex then a pang like a lightningthrust
and a crash like the thunder that goes with it and she saw a tall man
striding rapidly from the window She was still sure it was no personal
concern of hers yet an idle curiosity noted his great height his dark
mulattolike skin and a slight halt in his walk as he passed through a
narrow beam of light and off into the engulfing darkness

It was many minutes before Gwen regained any considerable command of her
faculties and she afterwards told me that she was even then more
than half inclined to consider the whole thing as a weird dream of an
overwrought mind At length however she realised that she had had an
actual experience and that it was of sufficient importance to make it
known at once She accordingly hastened to lay the whole matter before
me and I in my turn notified the police who at once instituted as
thorough a search as Gwens description made possible She had told me
that her assailant was darkskinned yet with straight hair and a cast
of features that gave no hint of any Ethiopian taint This and his
halting gait and great stature were all the police had in the way
of description and I may as well add that the information was
insufficient for they never found any trace of Gwens assailant

I had had some hopes of this clue but they were doomed to
disappointment It seemed evident to us that if anything were ever done
in bringing Mr Darrows assassin to justice Maitland would have to
do it unless indeed M Godin solved the problem Osborne Allen and
their associates were simply out of the question

We debated for some time as to whether or not we should write Maitland
about Gwens strange experience and finally decided that the knowledge
would be a constant source of worriment without being of the least
assistance to him while he was so far away We therefore decided to
keep our own counsel for the present at least

Maitland had written us a few lines from New York telling us the result
of his analysis and ended by saying

There is no doubt that Mr Darrow died of poison injected into the blood
through the slight wound in the throat This wound was not deep and
seemed to have been torn rather than cut in the flesh What sort of
weapon or projectile produced that wound is a question of the utmost
importance shrouded in the deepest of mysteries Once this point is
settled however its very uniqueness will be greatly in our favour I
have an idea our friend Ragobah might be able to throw some light
upon this subject therefore I am starting on my way to visit him this
afternoon and shall write you en route whenever occasion offers My
kindest regards to Miss Darrow

Yours sincerely

GEORGE MAITLAND

P S I shall have leisure now on shipboard to set tie that question of
atomic pitches which is still a thorn in my intellectual flesh

I handed this letter to Gwen and after she had read it through very
carefully she questioned me about this new theory of Maitlands I went
through the form of telling her after the usual practice of amiable
men discoursing to women feeling sure she would be no wiser when I
had finished and was dumfounded when she replied It looks very
reasonable Professor Bjerknes if I remember the name has produced all
the phenomena of magnetic attraction repulsion and polarisation by
air vibrations corresponding I suppose to certain fixed musical notes
Why might not something similar to this be true of atomic as well as of
larger bodies

If the roof of my house had fallen in I should not have been more
surprised than at this quiet remark How many times had I said You can
always count on a young woman however much she flutter over the surface
of things being ignorant of all the great underlying verities of
existence I promptly decided on all future occasions to add to
thatWhen not brought up by her father I was convinced that of the
attainments of a girl educated by her father absolutely nothing could be
definitely predicted

We had a short note from Maitland written at Trieste He excused its
brevity by saying he had been obliged to travel night and day in order
to reach this port in time to catch the Austrian Lloyd steamer Helois
bound for Aden Bombay Ceylon Singapore and Hong Kong From Aden I
received the following

MY DEAR DOCTOR

We have just been through the Red Sea and I know now the real origin of
the Calvinistic hell Imagine it A cloudless sky the sun beating
down with an intolerable fierceness not a breath stirring and the
thermometer registering 120 degrees F in the shade It seemed as though
reason must desert us The constant motion of the punkas in the saloons
and an unlimited supply of icewater was all that saved us Sleep was
hardly to be thought of for at no time during the night did the mercury
drop below 100 deg F Apart from the oppressive heat referred to
the entire voyage has been exceedingly pleasant I have not solved the
atomicpitch problems as attendance at meals has left me little time
for anything else They seem to eat all the time on these boats At 8 A
M coffee and bread at ten a hearty breakfast of meat eggs curry and
rice vegetables and fruit at 1 P M a luncheon called tiffin
of cold meats bread and butter potatoes and tea at five oclock
a regular dinner of soups meats with relishes farinaceous dishes
dessert fruits and coffee and lastly at 8 P M the evening meal
of tea bread and butter and other light dishes Five meals a day
and there are some English people who fill up the gaps between them
by constantly munching nuts and sweets Verily if specialisation of
function means anything some of these people will soon become huge
gastric balloons with a little wart on top representing the atrophied
brain structure They run their engines of digestion wholly on the
highpressure system

After eight days voyage on the Indian Ocean we shall be in Bombay I
must close now for there is really nothing to say and besides I am
wanted on deck My engagement is with a Rev Mr Barrows who is bound
as missionary to Hong Kong This worthy Methodist gentleman is very much
exercised because I insist that potentiality is necessity and rebut his
arguments on freewill He got quite excited yesterday and said to me
severely Do you mean to say young man that I cant do as I please
I must say I dont think his warmth was much allayed by my replying I
certainly mean to say you cant please as you please You may eat sugar
because you prefer it to vinegar but you cant prefer it just because
you will to do so He has probably got some new arguments now and is
anxious to try their effect so with kind regards to Miss DarrowI
trust she is wellI remain

Cordially your friend

GEORGE MAITLAND

P S Like a woman I always write a postscript You shall hear again
from me as soon as I reach Bombay

This last promise was religiously kept though his letter was short
and merely announced his safe arrival early that morning He closed by
saying I have not yet breakfasted preferring to do so on land and
I feel that I can do justice to whatever is set before me I intend as
soon as I have taken the edge off my appetite to set out immediately
for Malabar Hill as I believe that to be our proper startingpoint
I inclose a little sketch I made of Bombay as we came up its harbour
thinking it may interest Miss Darrow Kindly give it to her with
my regards You will note that there are two tongues of land in the
picture On the eastern side is the suburb of Calaba and on the
western our Malabar Hill Goodbye until I have something of interest to
report

I gave the sketch to Gwen and she seemed greatly pleased with it

Are you aware she said to me that Mr Maitland draws with rare
precision

I am fully persuaded I rejoined that he does not do anything which
he cannot do well

I believe there is nothing she continued which so conduces to the
habit of thoroughness as the experiments of chemistry When one learns
that even a grain of dust will in some cases vitiate everything
he acquires a new conception of the term clean and is likely to be
thorough in washing his apparatus From this the habit grows upon him
and widens its application until it embraces all his actions

This remark did not surprise me as it would have a few weeks before for
I had come to learn that Gwen was liable at any time to suddenly evince
a very unfeminine depth of observation and firmness of philosophical
grasp

Maitland had been gone just six weeks to a day when we received from him
the first news having any particular bearing upon the matter which had
taken him abroad I give this communication in his own words omitting
only a few personal observations which I do not feel justified in
disclosing and which moreover are not necessary to the completeness
of this narrative

MY DEAR DOCTOR

I have at last something to report bearing upon the case that brought
me here and perhaps I can best relate it by simply telling you what
my movements have been since my arrival My first errand was to Malabar
Hill I thought it wise to possess myself so far as possible of facts
proving the authenticity of Mr Darrows narrative I found without
difficulty the banyan tree which had been the trystingplace and close
by it the little cave with its mysterious welleverything in fact
precisely as related even to the Farsees garden or cemetery with
its Tower of Silence or Dakhma as it is called by the natives The
cave and the banyan are among the many attractions of what is now Herr
Blascheks villa This gentleman with true German hospitality asked
me to spend a few days with him and I was only too glad to accept his
invitation as I believed his knowledge of Bombay might be of great
service to me In this I did not mistake I told him I wished to
ascertain the whereabouts of a Rama Ragobah who had been something
between a rishi and a fakir and he directed me at once to a fakir named
Parinama who he said would be able to locate my man if he were still
alive and in Bombay

You can imagine how agreeably surprised I was to find that Parinama knew
Ragobah well I had anticipated some considerable difficulty in learning
the latters whereabouts and here was a man who couldfor a sufficient
considerationtell me much if not all about him I secured an
interpreter paid Parinama my money and proceeded to catechise him I
give you my questions and his answers just as I jotted them down in my
notebook

Q What is Ragobahs full name

A Rama Ragobah

Q How long have you known him

A Thirtyfive year

Q Has he always lived in Bombay

A No Sahib

Q Where else

A For a good many year he have travel all the time

Q Is he in Bombay now

A No Sahib

Q Where is he

A Over the sea Sahib

Q Do you know where

A He sail for America New York

Q When

A About eleven week ago

Q Do you know for what he undertook this journey

A Some personal affair of long time ago which he wish to settlethe
same which make him so many year travel through India

Q Was he in search of someone

A Yes Sahib

Q Some Indian woman

A No Sahib

Q Some other woman then

A No Sahib

Q A man then an Englishman

A Yes Sahib

Q What kind of a man is this Ragobah

A He very big man

Q What is his disposition Is he generally liked

A No His temper bad He cruel revengeful overbearing and selfish
He most hated by those who best know him

Q He is a friend of yours you say

A I say no such thing Do you think I sell secret of friend I have
great reason for hating him or I not now be earning your money

Q Ah I see What did you say he wanted of this Englishman

A I no say Sahib

Q You said some personal affair of long standing I believe

A Yes Sahib

Q Do you know its nature

A No I not know it but I have not much doubt about it Sahib

Q What do you think then

A I think there but one passion strong enough in Ragobah to make plain
his hunt like dog for last twenty year Such persevere mean strong
motive and as I have good reason to remember how quick he forget a
kindness I know he not moved by friendship Sahib

Q His motive then is

A Revenge

Q Have you any idea why he cherishes this malice

A I think it because some old love affair some rival in his wifes
love

Q Indeed Then he has been married

A Yes Sahib

Q Where shall I find his wife

A All that is left of her is in the bottomless well in the cave on
Malabar Hill

Q Did Ragobah kill her

A No that is not with his own hand

Q How long ago did she die

A More than twenty year Sahib

Q Are any of her relatives living

A Her husband Sahib and a cousin that is all

Q Is there anyone else who could tell me of this woman

A Moro Scindia could but he not do it

Q Why Is he Ragobahs friend

A Ragobah has no friends Sahib

Q Why then

A He under oath to tell what was told him only to one person He has
keep his secret out of every year for more as twenty year and can no be
expect to tell to you Sahib

Q Can you bring this man to me You will both be well paid for your
time of course

A I bring him Sahib but I not make him speak

Q Let me see you both then tonight at eight at Herr Blascheks
villa on Malabar Hill Ask for Mr Maitland

A We be there Anything more Sahib

Q Yes When is Ragobah expected to return

A He write that he think he return on the Dalmatia She due next day
after tomorrow

Q Has Ragobah any physical peculiarities

A His hands and feet they very small for man so big and strong

Q Anything else

A His left leg been hurt The foot very bad shape and the whole leg
some bad andwhat you callhalt when he walk

Q Has he the habit of biting his finger nails

A I not know he has Sahib

This completed the list of questions which I had desired to ask him
so after once more receiving his assurance that he would meet me in the
evening with his friend Scindia I left him As you know I am not wont
to draw conclusions until all the evidence is in but I must confess
that looking at the whole matter from start to finish there seems to
have fallen upon Ragobah a net of circumstantial evidence so strong
and with a mesh of detail so minute that it does not seem possible a
mosquito could escape from it Look at it a moment from this standpoint
Ragobah alone so far as we know has a motive for the murder His
victim has related the feud existing between them and foretold with an
air of the utmost assurance just such an outcome thereof Add to this
that this man leaves India on a mission which those about him do not
hesitate to pronounce one of vengeance at just such a time as would
enable him to reach Boston just a little before the commission of
the murder that this mission is the culmination of twenty years of
unremitting search for revenge that this malignity is supposed to be
directed against some rival in his wifes affections and the chain of
circumstantial evidence possesses so far as it extends no weak link
Then too Ragobah has very small hands a deformed left foot and a
limping gaiteverything almost which we had already predicted of the
assassin So sure am I that Ragobah is the guilty man that I shall ask
for his arrest upon his arrival day after tomorrow should he return
then a thing which I regret to say does not impress me as altogether
likely Should he not come I shall cable you to institute a search for
your end of the line The next thing in order which I have to relate is
my interview with Moro Scindia I had engaged an interpreter but was
able to dismiss him as my guest spoke English with more ease and fluency
than he being an intelligent and welltodo member of the Vaisya caste
I thought it wise to see the venerable Scindia alone and accordingly
sent Parinama out of the room with the interpreter As before I give
you what passed between us as I jotted it down in my notebook

Q You are a friend of Rama Ragobah are you not

A No Sahib he has no friends

Q You speak as if you disliked him

A It is not Mono Scindias habit to play the hypocrite I have good
reason to hate him

Q You would not then had he committed a crime assist him to escape
justice

A I would track him like a bloodhound to the ends of the earth

Q You knew Ragobahs wife

A She was my cousin Sahib

Q Were your relations friendly

A They were more than friendly I loved her dearly and would have
tried to win her had I not been so much her senior

Q Did she live happily with Ragobah

A No Sahib

Q Why

A I cannot answer I have sworn to reveal the last experiences of my
cousin to but one person

Q And that person is

A I must decline to answer that also Sahib

Q If I succeed in naming him will you acknowledge it

A You will not succeed Sahib

Q But if I should

A I will acknowledge it

Q The person is John Hinton Darrow

The old man started as if he had been stabbed and looked at me in
amazement He seemed at first to think I had read his thoughts and
riveted his dark eyes upon me as if by way of return he would read my
very soul I think he did so for his scrutiny seemed to satisfy him He
replied somewhat reassured I can speak only to John Hinton Darrow

John Darrow is dead I said

Dead he exclaimed springing to his feet Darrow Sahib dead and he
fell back into his chair covering his face with his hands Ah my poor
Lona he muttered feebly I have failed to keep my promise Do not
reproach me for I have done my best For twenty years have I searched
in vain for this man that I might fulfil your last request and the very
first information I receive is the news of his death I have been no
less vigilant than Ragobah yet I have failed even as he has failed

I took this opportunity to again question him

Q Are you sure Ragobah failed

A Yes had he found Darrow Sahib he would have killed him His mission
was one of revenge mine one of love and justice both have failed
utterly since their object is dead My pledge is broken

Q In its letter yes but the chance is still left you to keep the
spirit of your covenant

A I do not understand you Sahib

Q I will explain Lona Ragobah confided to you certain facts
in explanation of her conduct toward John Darrow She loved him
passionately and it was her desire to stand acquitted in his sight
Were she alive now any wish he had expressed during his life would be
fulfilled by her as a sacred and pleasurable duty This then as one
who lovingly performs her will should be your attitude also John
Darrow was the only man she ever loved and were she living every drop
of her loyal blood would rise against anyone who had done him injury Do
I not speak the truth

A Yes she was loyal unto death and so shall I be My hand has ever
been against all who have done her harm Ragobah knows that full well

Q Were she alive you certainly would aid her in bringing to justice
one who has done her the most cruel of wrongs and at the same time
fulfilling the dying request of the man who to her was more than life

A I should do her bidding Sahib

Q How much more need then now that the poor woman is dead that you
should act for her as she would were she here

A You have not told me all speak your mind freely Sahib You may
depend upon my doing whatever I believe Lona would do were she here

Q I ask nothing more and am now prepared to fully confide in you As
you doubtless know Rama Ragobah left Bombay for New York about eleven
weeks ago He went I have been told on an errand of revenge Six weeks
ago John Darrow was murdered He left behind him a written statement
describing his wooing of Lona Scindia and his experiences with Rama
Ragobah He asserted furthermore his belief that he would die by
Ragobahs handthe hand which twice before had attempted his life
Even as he loved your cousin so he hated her husband and confident
that he would ultimately be killed by him he was haunted by the fear
that he would escape the just penalty for his crime He bound his heir
by the most solemn of promises to use in the event of his murder every
possible means to bring the assassin to justice There can of course
be little doubt that the assassin and Rama Ragobah are one and the same
person The last request John Darrow ever madeit was after he had
been attacked by the assassinhad for its object the punishment of his
murderer Were your cousin living do you think she would be deaf to
that entreaty

A No She would make its fulfilment the one object of her life and
acting in her stead I shall do all in my power to see justice done If
I can render you any aid in that direction you may command me Sahib

Q You can assist me by telling me all you know of your cousins married
life and more especially the message she confided to you

A In doing this I shall break the letter of my oath but were I not to
do it I should break the spirit thereof therefore listen

You have I suppose already learned from the statement of Darrow Sahib
what occurred at his last meeting with my cousin on Malabar Hill Her
act in throwing a venomous serpent in his face was one which doubtless
led him to believe she wished to kill him although it must have puzzled
him to assign any reason for such a desire Not long after this incident
my cousin married Ragobah a man for whom she had always cherished an
illconcealed hatred I saw but little of her at this time yet for
all that I could not but observe that she was greatly changed But one
solution suggested itself to me and that was that she had discovered
her lover false to her and had out of spite as it is called hastily
married Ragobah I confess that when this conclusion forced itself home
upon me I felt much dissatisfied with Lona for I thought such a course
unworthy of her As I saw more of her I noted still greater changes
in her character As I had known her from childhood she had been most
uniform in her temper and her conduct now all this was changed
Today perhaps she would be like her old selfonly weaker and more
fragiletomorrow a new being entirely stronger and more restless
with a demoniac light in her eyes and a sort of feverish malignancy
dominating her whole personality When I noticed this I studied to avoid
her If the Lona I had known were merely an ideal of which no actual
prototype existed I wished to be allowed to cherish that ideal rather
than to have it cruelly shattered to make room for the real Lona I had
not seen her for many weeks when one day to my surprise I received
a note from her It was short and so impressed me that I can remember
every word of it

My DEAR COUSIN

I send this note to you by Kandia that you may get it before it is too
late for you to do what I wish I am a caged bird in my husbands house
My every movement is watched and they would not let you come to me
were my husband at home so I beseech you come at once lest he should
return before I have had time to intrust to you my last request I am
dying Moro and it is within your power to say whether my spirit shall
rest in peace or be torn forever and ever by the fangs of a horrible
regret My secret is as lead upon my soul and to you only can I tell it
Comecome at once

 LONA

You can imagine the effect of this revelation upon me better than I can
describe it I did not even know she was seriously ill and with her
urgent request for an interview came the sad tidings that she was dying
and the confirmation of my fearthat she had adopted the religion of
her English lover I lost no time in going to her I found her in a
state of feverish expectation fearful lest I should either not be able
to come at all or her husband would return before my arrival She was
worn to a shadow of her former self and I realised with a pang that she
was indeed dying

I knew I could depend upon you Moro she said as I entered even
though you think I have lost all claim upon your regard I said to
myself He will come because of the respect he once had for me and I
was right Yes she continued noticing my astonishment at the change
in her condition I am almost gone I should not have lasted so long
were it not that I could not die till I had spoken Now I shall be free
to go and the horrible struggle will be over You have been much among
the English Moro both here and in England and know they believe they
will meet again in heaven those they have loved on earth

She sank back exhausted from excitement and effort as she said this
and I feared for a moment she would be unable to proceed I told her
what I knew about the Christians hope of heaven and suggested to her
that as her husband might return at any moment she had best confide
to me at once any trust with which she wished to charge me For a moment
she made no reply but said at length

Yes you are right It is not a very long story and I suppose I had
better begin at the beginning You remember well my being rescued by
an English gentleman a Mr John Darrow I afterward became well
acquaintedin fact we were to be married To this union my parents
strongly objected They had promised me to Rama Ragobah and were
horrified at my seeking to outrage the laws of caste by bestowing my
hand not only outside of my station but upon a foreigner and Christian
as well This had only the effect of causing me to meet the Sahib
secretly We chose for our meetingplace the great banyan on the top
of Malabar Hill where I passed the happiest moments I have ever known
Everything went well until the night on which we had planned to run
away We were to meet at the usual place and hour take the night train
for Matheron Station and there be married

My heart bounded with joy as I climbed Malabar Hill on that fatal
evening but my delight was of short duration In my fear lest I should
keep my lover waiting I must have arrived fully fifteen minutes before
the appointed time I was standing with my back against the banyan
tree awaiting the first sound of his approach when my attention was
attracted by what seemed to be two little balls of fire shining from a
clump of bushes almost directly in front of me They seemed to burn with
a lurid and wicked glare and as my gaze became entangled by them
a tremor ran through my frame and a cold sweat bathed my entire body
Overcome by an unspeakable dread I made one last frantic effort to
withdraw my eyes but could not Then gradually by slow degrees my
terror was succeeded by an overwhelming fascination I felt myself
drawn irresistibly toward the thicket Then came a vague sense of
falling falling falling and I knew no more at least for some little
time

The next thing I remember is seeing my lover stretch out his arms to
me while I was inspired with an unaccountable hatred of him so bitter
that it left me mute and transfixed Then he sought to embrace me and
I threw a young cobra which coiled in a wicker basket had been placed
in my hand full in his face I think also that I struck him and then
ran down the hill and straight to the house of Ragobah What happened
during the next few months I know not I seemed to have been in a
continual sleep full of dreams When I awoke I seemed conscious that I
had dreamt but could not tell of what You can imagine my horror my
despair when I was first addressed as Ragobahs wife I denied the
relation but everyone told me the same storyI was Ragobah Sahibah
This shock coming as it did with the memory of my conduct that terrible
night on Malabar Hill nearly killed me and was followed by another
long period of the dream existence I began to think I was a sufferer
from some terrible brain disease and to doubt which was my real
existence the dreams or the waking moments

One day when for the first time in several weeks I was in possession
of my normal faculties Ragobah came into my room and sat down beside
me I arose instantly and fled to the farther corner of the apartment
He pursued me and sought to conquer my all too apparent aversion for
him by terms of endearment but the more he pressed his suit the more my
loathing grew until maddened by references made to Darrow Sahib I lost
all selfcontrol and permitted him to learn my detestation of him He
heard me through in silence his face growing darker with every word
and when I had finished said with slow and studied malice

You forget that you are my wife and that I can follow my entreaty by
command You spurn my love You are not yet weaned from that English cur
whose life let me tell you is in my hands Fool can you not see how
powerless you are I have but to will you to kill him and your first
cursed failure on Malabar Hill will be washed out with his infidel
blood You will do well to yield peaceably The thread of your very
existence passes through my hands to cut or tangle it as I listyield
you must With this he strode frantically from the room leaving me
more dead than alive As he disclosed his fiendish secret something
about my heart kept tightening with every word till at length it
seemed as if it must burst so terrible was the pressure I could not
breathe My lungs seemed filled with molten lead How long this agony
continued I do not know for the thread of consciousness broke under its
terrible tension and I fell senseless upon the floor

When I recovered from my swoon the inexpressible horror of my situation
again descended upon my spirit like a snuffer upon a candle I was
Ragobahs wife his slave his tool as powerless to resist his will as
if I were one of his limbs All was now clear The long sleep crowded
with unremembered dreams represented the period when I was under
Ragobahs controlthe horrible night on Malabar Hill being one of
themand the waking moments those periods when my feeble overridden
consciousness flickered back to dimly light for a time the gloom of
this intellectual night There was no hope for me Already had I been so
dominated by his will and inspired by his malice as to attempt the life
of my lover What might I not be made to do in future As I thought of
this Ragobahs last threat rang with a sinister warning upon my ears
till it seemed as if it would drive me into madness The suspicion
grew to be a certainty from which there was but one means of
escapedeathand I determined at once to embrace it before I could be
made the instrument for the infliction of further injury upon my lover
I seized a little dagger which in my normal moments I always kept
concealed about me and was about to plunge it into my bosom when I
was smitten by the thoughtand it cut me as the steel could not have
donethat Darrow Sahib would never know the truth and that his love
for me would be forever buried beneath a mass of black misgivings
The certainty of this conviction paralysed my will and my arm dropped
nervelessly at my side It would be a simple matter I thought to
find some way of confiding my story to you and pledging you to explain
everything to Darrow Sahib after which I could die in peace if not
without regret But it was not so easy to communicate with you as I had
expected Days passed before I had a chance to make the attempt and the
only result of it was to show me how closely I was watched If Ragobah
were absent there was always someone in his employ who made it his
business to acquaint himself with my every movement I dare not take
the time to tell you how I succeeded in obtaining this interview further
than to say that I was able to win to my cause the man who bore my
message to youa servant in whom Ragobah has the utmost confidence
When my husband departed this morning Kandia was left in charge of me
and so your visit was made possible

You are now acquainted with the trust I would impose upon you swear to
me Moro that you will make this explanation for me to John Darrow and
to no other human being Swear it by the love you once said you bore
me She sank back exhausted and awaited my response For a moment I
dared not trust myself to speak yet something must be said As I noted
her impatience I replied Lona you have lifted a great weight from
my heart and placed a lesser one upon it Forgive me that I have ever
doubted you Even as you have been true to yourself I swear by the love
I still bear you to deliver your message to Darrow Sahib and to no other
human being I shall commit your words at once to writing that nothing
may be lost through the failure of my memory

She reached her hand out feebly to me and never shall I forget the look
of gratitude which accompanied its tremulous pressure as she murmured
After John Moro you are dearest I shall not try to thank you
May the ineffable peace which you bring my aching heart return a
thousandfold into your own Farewell Ragobah may return at any moment
Let us not needlessly imperil your safety Once more goodbye The
dewdrop now may freely fall into the shining sea Poor distraught
child She had tried to adopt her lovers religion without abandoning
her own I bent over and kissed her It was my first and last kiss and
she gave it with a sweet sadness the memory of which through all
these years has dwelt in the better part of me like a fragrance in the
vesture of the soul One long lingering look and I departed never to
see again this woman I had so fondly so hopelessly loved

You now know the exact nature of the covenant I have felt constrained
to violate I have told you her story in her own words I wrote it out
immediately after my interview with her and have read it so many times
during the last twenty years that I have committed it to memory The
recollection of that last meeting of her kiss and her grateful look has
been throughout all these long weary years the one verdant spot in the
desert of my life

Moro Scindia paused here as one who had reached the end of his
narrative and I continued my interrogations

Q Although you never again saw your cousin you must I think have
heard something of her fate

A I learned of it through Nana Kandia the servant who had secretly
embraced Lonas cause and who had borne her message to me It seems
that after my interview with her my cousin was seized with a consuming
desire to see her English lover once more before her death so she
devised a plan by which with Kandias help Darrow Sahib was to be
secretly conducted to her under cover of night She wrote a letter
asking him as a last request to meet her messenger on Malabar Hill
and instructing him how to make himself known This she gave to Kandia
to post early in the morning of the day upon which their plan was to be
put into execution As he was about leaving the house Ragobah called him
into his chamber and demanded to know what was taking him forth so early
in the morning Kandia saw at once that the purpose of his errand had
been discovered and determined to meet the issue bravely I was going
to post a letter Sahib he replied quietly Let me see it Ragobah
roared I have no right to do so Kandia replied springing toward the
door But he was not quick enough for the wary Ragobah who felled him
to the floor with a chair before he had reached the threshold When
he returned to consciousness he found his assailant who had skilfully
opened the letter standing over him perusing it in malicious glee When
he had finished reading he carefully resealed it and placed it in his
pocket Then he called two of his servants and gave Kandia into their
charge with orders to gag him to bind him hand and foot and as they
valued their lives not to permit him to leave the room till he ordered
it

What occurred between that time and the return of Ragobah wounded and
furious late in the evening we can only surmise He doubtless posted
the letter and went himself to meet Darrow Sahib on Malabar Hill When
he returned home he hobbled into his wifes apartment and then ordered
Kandia to be sent to him His left leg was badly crushed and his face
contorted with pain and fiendish malevolence was horrible to look upon

Our trusty friend here he said addressing his wife and pointing to
Kandia could not conveniently post your letter this morning my dear
so I did it myself Lonas face turned ashen pale but she made no
reply

I thought he continued in his sweetest accents and with the same
demoniac sarcasm that you would be anxious to know if the Sahib
received itour mail service is so lax of lateso I went tonight
to Malabar Hill to see for I felt certain he would come if he got your
note and sure enough he was there even ahead of time I was obliged
to forego the pleasure of bringing him to you on account of two most
unfortunate accidents As you see I hurt my foot and poor Darrow Sahib
slipped and fell headlong into the well in the little cave As it has no
bottom I could not of course get the Sahib out and so was obliged
to return as best I could alone As he finished this heartless lie
every word of which he knew was a poisoned dart Lona fell fainting upon
the floor Kandia raised her gently expecting to find her dead but was
able at length to revive her The first words she said were directed to
Ragobah in a voice devoid of passion or reproachof everything in fact
save an unutterable weariness

I am ill she said will you permit Nana to get me some medicine
which has helped me in similar attacks Ragobahs reply was directed to
Kandia

You may do as the Sahibah bids you was all he said

Kandia turned to Lona for instructions and she said to him Get me half
an ounce ofstay there are several ingredientsI had better write
them down She wrote upon a little slip of paper naming aloud the
ingredients and quantities as she did so and then asked Kandia to move
her chair to an open window before he left When he had done so she
passed him the note saying Please get it as quickly as possible
As he took the paper she seized his hand for a moment and pressed it
firmly He noticed this at the time but its significance did not dawn
upon him until he had nearly reached his destination when all at once
he realised with a pang that the momentary pressure of the hand and the
mute gratitude which shone from the eyes were meant as a farewell His
first impulse was to hurriedly retrace his steps but before he had
acted upon it the thought occurred to him that she intended to poison
herself with the drugs he was about to procure If this were the case
there was no great need of hurry Then he began to recall to mind the
names of the drugs she had mentioned as she wrote and to reflect that
not one of them was poisonous With this new light all his former
uneasiness returned He strove to reassure himself with the thought
that she might in order to mislead Ragobah have spoken the name of a
harmless drug while she wrote down that of a poisonous one It was easy
to settle this question and he determined to do so at the next light
He unfolded the paper expecting to see a prescription but read instead
these words

To MORO SCINDIA

My Dear Cousin Death has relieved you of the task I imposed upon you
John Darrows body is in the well in the cave on Malabar Hill where
before this reaches you my body will have also gone to meet it To this
fragment of paper then must I confide the debt of gratitude I owe to
you and to him who will bear it to you Nana Kandia Goodbye If I had
had two hearts I should have given you one Do not mourn me but
rather rejoice that my struggle and its agony are over John has already
goneone tomb shall inclose both our bodieshow could it have been
better

LONA

No sooner had Kandia grasped the import of this letter than he rushed
with all speed to Malabar Hill but he was too late for scarcely had
he left the house upon Lonas errand before she had sprung out of
the window by which he had placed her Ragobahs wound prevented his
following her and when he had summoned others to pursue her the
darkness had closed about her form and none knew the way she had taken
At the edge of the fatal well Kandia found a piece of paper beneath a
stone and on it these words

Farewell Moro and Nana the only beings on earth I regret to leave

Lona

The body was never recovered The news of his wifes death and the
knowledge that he was the cause of it produced an effect upon Ragobah
from which he never recovered More than twenty years have passed since
then yet from that day to this he has never been known to smile Long
before his mangled limb had healed it became evident to all who knew
him that he had henceforth but one purpose in liferevenge and that
nothing save death could turn him from his purpose so long as his rival
lived The knowledge of this made my search for Darrow Sahib more than
ever difficult from the fact that it must be prosecuted secretly I
could only learn that he had left Bombay for the interior nothing more
My inquiries in all the Indian cities proved fruitless and in many
instances I was informed that Ragobah had instituted a search for
the same man I think in spite of my precautions some of my agents
ultimately told Ragobah of my efforts for I found myself so closely
watched by men in his interests that I was at length compelled to give
up the personal conduct of the search and to continue it through a
deputy unknown to him All my endeavours to find the Sahib were as
you are already aware fruitless and until I met you I had no doubt
Ragobahs efforts were equally unproductive You have now all the
information I can offer upon the subject If I can be of any further
service to you you need not hesitate to command me

As he said this he rose to depart and I promised to keep him informed of
what occurred I have nothing now to do but to await with such patience
as I can command the arrival of the Dalmatia It does not seem to me
altogether probable that Ragobah will return upon this boat but if he
should I shall have him arrested the moment he sets foot on shore If
he escape the net that has been woven about him I shall be a convert
to Eastern occultism and no mistake I trust Miss Darrow is well and
hopeful I know she will religiously keep the promise she made for she
is one of those women who fully understand the nature of a covenant
and I am easier therefore than I otherwise could be regarding her
condition Give her my kind regards and tell her that she may expect
news of importance by my next communication It is very late so
goodbye until the arrival of the Dalmatia

Your friend

GEORGE MAITLAND

This letter was delivered one morning when Gwen my sister Alice and
I were at breakfast As I broke the seal I noticed that both ladies put
down their knives and forks and ceased to eat A glance at Gwens eager
face convinced me that she had no appetite for anything but my letter
and I accordingly read it aloud When I came to the last part of it
where Maitland referred to her a flush of pride I thought at the time
overspread her face and when I had finished she said with some show of
excitement If Mr Maitland succeed in bringing Ragobah to justice II
shall owe him a debt of gratitude I can never repay It all seems like a
romance only so frightfully real We may expect another letter in a few
days may we not And Mr Maitland when may we expect him

I replied that I thought we might reasonably expect news of importance
within five or six days and that so far as Maitlands return was
concerned I did not look for it for as many weeks as he would
doubtless have to cope with the laws delay there as he would if here
and to comply with many tedious formalities before the government would
allow Ragobah to be brought to this country for trial The only reply
Gwen vouchsafed to this statement was a longdrawn unconscious sigh
which I interpreted as meaning Will it never end




CHAPTER II


 He who shakes the tree of Vengeance but harvests apples of Sodom
 in whose fruit of ashes he becomes buried for the wage of the
 sinner is death

There was no doubt of Ragobahs guilt in any of our minds so that
action at our end of the line seemed entirely useless and nothing
was left us but to quietly await whatever developments Maitland should
disclose We were not kept long in suspense for in less than a week
his next letter arrived I broke its seal in the presence of Gwen and my
sister who if possible were even more excited than I myself Is it to
be wondered at Here was the letter which was to tell us whether or not
the murderer of John Darrow had been caught We felt that if Ragobah had
returned to India according to his expressed intention there could be
no doubt upon this point But had he so returned I read as follows

MY DEAR DOCTOR

The Dalmatia arrived as expected on Thursday and on her came Ragobah
I had him arrested as he stepped from the boat When examined he did not
seem in the least disconcerted at the charges I preferred against him
This did not surprise me however as I had expected that a man who
could roll his naked body over the burning sands from Mabajan to
the Ganges and who could rise from the Vaisyan to the Brahman
castealbeit he fell againwould not be likely to betray his
cause by exhibiting either fear or excitement He acknowledged his
acquaintance with Mr Darrow and the illfeeling existing between them
When charged with his murder at Dorchester on the night of the 22d of
April he coolly asked if I were aware when and how he had left India I
had not neglected to look this matter up and told him he had left on the
same steamer which had brought him backthe Dalmatiawhich should have
arrived at New York on the 21st of April thus leaving him ample time to
get to Boston before the night of the 22d To this he replied with the
utmost assurance I give you the exact gist of what he said Since I
was not able to immediately commit his language to writing you will
of course hardly expect me to remember those peculiar Oriental idioms
which an Indian however great his command of English never drops What
I say here is of course true of all conversations I put before you
except such as I practically reportedBut to return to our muttons
As I was saying he replied with the utmost assurance


The Sahib is right I did sail upon the Dalmatia due at New York on
the 21st of April This steamer as you are perhaps aware is propelled
by twin screws On the trip in question she broke one of her propellers
in midAtlantic and in consequence arrived in New York on the 24th
of April three days late without the transference of any of her
passengers to other boats If you will take the trouble to at once
verify this statement at the steamship office you will be able to
relieve me of the annoyance of further detention

All this was said with a rare command of language and a cold cynical
politeness which cut like a knife I at first thought it was merely a
ruse to gain time but the steamship officials substantiated every word
uttered by Ragobah relative to their vessel The Dalmatia had steamed
into New York at eleven oclock on the morning of the 24th day of April
with a broken screw

Imagine my amazement The net of circumstantial evidence wound around
Ragobah seemed to be such as to leave no possibility of escape and yet
the very first effort made to draw it tighter about him had resulted in
his walking with the utmost ease right through its meshes There is
no gainsaying such an alibi and I am therefore forced to acknowledge
that Rama Ragobah could not by any possibility have murdered John
Darrow That he may have planned the deed and that he may have intended
to be present at its execution is quite possible but we may at once
dismiss the idea of his having personally committed the act You will
immediately appreciate that nearly all of the evidence which we secured
against Ragobah was directed against him as the assassin and is of
little or no use to prove his complicity in an affair committed by
another In his hatred of Mr Darrow we have I believe a sufficient
motive for the act but what evidence have we to support the theory
that the murder was committed by anyone acting in his interests I
must confess my inability to detect at present writing the slightest
evidence that Ragobah acted through an accomplice So here the matter
rests

I may state in closing that Ragobah has requested the pleasure sic
of a private interview with me on Malabar Hill tomorrow night As there
is a bare possibility he may let fall something which may shed some
light upon the accomplice hypothesis I have agreed to meet him at the
entrance to the little cave at nine oclock He has requested that I
come alone and I shall do so but lest you fear for my safety let me
assure you that I know very well the unscrupulous nature of the man with
whom I am to deal and that I shall take good care not to afford him any
opportunity to catch me unawares You will hear from me again after I
meet Ragobah

Remember me kindly to Miss Darrow The failure of my enterprise will
I know be a bitter disappointment to her and you must temper this
acknowledgment of it with such a hope of ultimate success as you may
enjoy Tell her I shall never cease my efforts to solve this mystery so
long as I am able to find a clue however slight to follow At present
I am all at sea and it looks as if I should have to go clear back and
start all over again Ragobah as a point of departure has not proved a
success With my kind regards to you all

I remain cordially yours

GEORGE MAITLAND

I read this through aloud despite the fact that I knew some parts of it
were intended only for my perusal Gwen did not speak until some minutes
after I had finished and then only to express a fear that despite his
caution harm might come to Maitland at his interview with Ragobah
She seemed to be far less disappointed at Maitlands failure to convict
Ragobah than she was fearful for her friends personal safety She was
restless and ill at ease for the next two or three daysin fact until
the arrival of Maitlands next letter This came during my absence on
a professional call and when I returned home she met me with it at the
door with an expression of relief upon her countenance so plain as not
to be misconstrued We went into the sittingroom where my sister was
awaiting the news and I read as follows

MY DEAR DOCTOR

I kept my appointment last night with Rama Ragobah and although nothing
transpired at all likely to assist me in locating Mr Darrows assassin
yet the interview though short was interesting and worth narrating
Promptly at nine oclock I was at my post by the little cave I am still
staying with Herr Blaschek and as I had but a few rods to travel I did
not quit the house until within five minutes of the time appointed for
our meeting As I stepped out into the darkness I noticed a tall form
glide behind a tree about a rod away from the door I could not be sure
it was Ragobah yet I had little doubt of it I was a trifle taken aback
at the moment and instinctively placed my hand upon my revolver and
grasped my cane more firmly Should occasion require it I counted
upon this cane quite as much as upon my revolver for innocent and
inoffensive as it looked it was capable of most deadly execution I had
chosen it in preference to many other more pretentious weapons which had
suggested themselves to me It consisted of a small flexible steel wire
hardly bigger than the blade of a foil surmounted by a goodsized lead
ball and the whole covered with a closely woven fabric By grasping the
cane by its lower end a tremendously heavy blow could be struck with the
ball and if an attempt were made to shield the head by throwing up the
arm it was almost certain to fail of its object since the flexibility
of the wire permitted it to bend about an obstruction until its loaded
end was brought home You will perhaps think that since I did not make
use of this weapon I need not have troubled myself to describe it
Perhaps that is so but let me assure you when I saw Ragobah for
it was he glide behind that tree and reflected how capable he was of
every kind of treachery I wouldnt have parted with that cane for its
weight in gold The Indian had pledged me to come alone and had promised
to do likewise but I felt any tree might conceal one of his minions
hired to assassinate me while he engaged my attention All this of
course did not in the least affect my decision I had promised to
go alone and Miss Darrows interests required that I should keep my
covenant I should have done so even though I had known Ragobah
meant to betray me I may as well however tell you at once that my
suspicions wronged the fellow He had evidently taken his station behind
a tree to satisfy himself without exposure that I meant to keep my
promise and come alone

When I reached the cave I found him awaiting me How he was able to get
there before me passes my comprehension but there he was He did not
waste time but addressed me at once and as my memory is excellent
and our interview was short I am able to give you an accurate report
of what passed between us I copy it here just as I entered it in my
notebook immediately upon my return to the house

You naturally wish to know Ragobah began why I have sought this
interview That is easily explained You have done me the honour Sahib
for I feel it is such to suspect me of the murder of John Darrow You
have come here from America to fasten the crime upon me and from
the bottom of my heart I regret your failure to do so I would give
everything I possess on earth and would gladly suffer a life of
torment to be able truthfully to say I Rama Ragobah killed John
Darrow But despite all my efforts I wretch that I am am
innocent For more than twenty years I have had but one purposeone
thoughtand that was to track down and slay John Darrow This desire
consumed me It led me all over India in vain search for him For
nineteen years I laboured incessantly without discovering so much as a
trace of him When he fled Bombay his belongings went inland so I was
told I believed the story and felt sure I should one day find him
on Indian soil Years passed and I did not find him It was but a few
months ago that I discovered his ruse and learned his whereabouts I
could scarcely contain myself for joy My lifework was at last to
be completed Nothing now remained but to plan his destruction This
however was not so easy a thing to do since in order to make my
revenge complete I must disclose my identity before killing him At
length I decided upon a plan I would come upon him at night when
asleep gag him and bind him to his bed Then he should learn the name
of his doomsman and the horrible nature of the death that awaited him

Ragobah paused here as if overcome by his disappointment and I said
And how did you intend to kill him He gave a throaty chuckle as
he replied It was all so very pretty I had only to saturate the
bedclothes with oil and set fire to them I should have lighted them at
his feet and watched the flames creep upward toward his head till safety
compelled my retreat It was for this purpose I went to New York You
already know the fatal delay I incurred When I landed I made all haste
to the home of Darrow Sahib in Dorchester only to learn that he had
killed himself a few days before my arrival The morsel for which I had
striven and hungered for twenty long years was whipped from my hand
even as I raised it to my mouth My enemy was dead beyond the power of
injury and my hands were unstained by his blood

I then determined to kill his daughter It was the night of my enemys
burial The Sahibah was alone in the house and was intending to leave it
that night I knew she would see that everything was securely fastened
before she went away and so when I opened one of the windows I was
sure she would come to close it Crouching down outside I awaited her
approach intending to spring up and stab her while she was pulling the
window down Everything happened as I plannedwhat ails the Sahib
I did not kill her No at the last moment somethingnever mind
whatstayed my arm The death of an innocent girl did not promise me
any lasting satisfaction and I gave up the idea returned to New York
and reembarked for Bombay as innocent in act as when I left it My life
had been a failure and I had no desire to prolong it When you arrested
me on the charge of murder nothing would have given me greater pleasure
than to have been able to plead guilty

You already know why I so hated Darrow He robbed me of the only woman
I ever loved Maddened by jealousy I told her I had thrown him into the
well in the cave here It was a lie but she believed it and fled from
me and in a few minutes had thrown herself into that bottomless hole
See Sahib he said entering the cave and pointing down the dark
shaftthat is the road she took in order that her bones might rest
with his and after all they are thousands of miles apart Its not
the triumph I planned but its all I have And this is why I brought
you here that you may take back to my enemys family the knowledge
that in death I am triumphant Tell them he said rising to his full
height that while the carcass of the English cur rots in a foreign
land Rama Ragobahs bones lie mingled with those of his beautiful
LonaMy blood was up and I rushed fiercely at him With the
quickness of a cat he dodged me spat in my face as I turned and with
a horrible laugh sprang headlong into the well Down deeper and deeper
sank the laughthen it died awaythen a faint plashand all was
silent Rama Ragobah was gone For fully ten minutes I stood dazed
and irresolute and then returned mechanically to the house I at first
thought of informing the authorities of the whole affair but when
I realised how hard it would be for me to prove my innocence were I
charged with Ragobahs murder I decided to keep the secret of the well

I shudder when I think of Miss Darrows narrow escape Did you suspect
who her assailant really was I wonder you have written me nothing about
it but suppose you thought it would only needlessly alarm me If you
had known it was our friend Ragobah you would doubtless have felt it
imperative that I should know of itso I conclude from your silence
that you did not discover his identity

I need not of course tell you my dear Doctor that we have reached
the end of our Indian clue and that I deem it wise all things
considered for me to get out of India just as soon as possible If this
letter is in any way delayed you need not be surprised if I have the
pleasure of relating its contents in person Remember me to Miss Darrow
and tell her how sorry I am that thus far I have been unable to be of
any real service to her As I shall see you so soon I need write nothing
further Kind regards to Miss Alice

Ever yours

GEORGE MAITLAND

When I had finished reading this letter I looked up at Gwen expecting
to see that its news had depressed her I must confess however that I
could not detect any such effect On the contrary she seemed to be
in much better spirits than when I began reading According to this
letter then she said addressing me somewhat excitedly we may
but she let fall her eyes and did not complete her sentence My sister
bestowed upon her one of those glances described in the vernacular of
woman as knowing and then said to me We may expect Mr Maitland at
any time it seems Yes I replied he will lose no time in getting
here He undoubtedly feels much chagrined at his failure and will now
be more than ever determined to see the affair through to a successful
conclusion He is in the position of a hound that has lost its scent
and is eager to return to its point of departure for a fresh start I
fancy it will be no easy task to discover a new clue and I shall watch
Maitlands work in this direction with a great deal of curiosity
Gwen did not speak but she listened to our conversation with a nearer
approach to a healthy interest than I had known her to display on any
other occasion since her fathers death I regarded this as a good omen
Her condition since that sad occurrence had worried me a good deal
She seemed to have lost her hold on life and to exist in a state of
wearied listlessness Nothing seemed to impress her and she would at
times forget in the midst of a sentence what she had intended to say
when she began it Her elasticity was gone and every effort a visible
burden to her I knew the consciousness of her loss was as a dull heavy
weight bearing her down and I knew too that she could not marshal her
will to resist itthat in fact she really didnt care so tired was
she of it all Experience had taught me how the dull heavy ache of
a great loss will press upon the consciousness with the regular
persistent relentless throb of a loaded wheel and eat out ones life
with the slow certainty of a cancer This I knew to have been Gwens
state since her fathers death and all my attempts to bring about a
healthful reaction had hitherto been futile It is not to be wondered
at therefore that even the transient interest she had evinced was
hailed by me with delight as the beginning of that healthful reaction
for which I had so long sought When a human bark in the full tide of
life is suddenly dashed upon the rocks of despair the wreckage is strewn
far and wide and it is with no little difficulty that enough can be
rescued to serve in the rebuilding of even the smallest of craft The
thought therefore that Gwens intellectual flotsam was beginning
at length to swirl about a definite object in a way to facilitate the
rescue of her faculties was to me a decidedly reassuring one and I
noted with pleasure that the state of excited expectancy which she had
tried in vain to conceal did not wane but waxed stronger as the days
went by




THE EPISODE OF THE PARALLEL READERS



CHAPTER I


 The events of the present are all strung upon the thread of the
 past and in telling over this chronological rosary it not
 infrequently happens that strange unlike beads follow each other
 between our questioning fingers

It was nearly a week after his letter before Maitland arrived He sent
us no further word but walked in one evening as we were talking about
him He came upon us so suddenly that we were all taken aback and for
a moment I felt somewhat alarmed about Gwen She had started up quickly
when the servant had mentioned Maitlands name and pressed her hand
convulsively upon her heart while her face and neck became of a deep
crimson colour I was saying to myself that this was a common effect of
sudden surprise when I saw her clutch quickly at the back of her chair
as if to steady herself A moment later she sank into her seat Her face
was now as pale as ashes and I felt I had good reason to be alarmed I
think she was conscious of my scrutiny for she turned her face from me
and remained motionless The movement told me she was trying to regain
command of her faculties and I forbore to interfere in the struggle
though I watched her with some solicitude My fears were at once
dispelled however when Maitland entered for Gwen was the first to
welcome him She extended her hand with much of her old impulsiveness
saying I have so much for which to thank you but Maitland
interrupted her Indeed I regret to say he rejoined that I have
been unable thus far to be of any real service to you The Ragobah clue
was a miserable failure though we may do ourselves the justice to admit
that we had no alternative but to follow it to the end I confess I have
never been more disappointed than in the outcome of this affair My
dear fellow I said we all have much to be thankful for in your safe
return let us not forget that Maitland laughed That reminds me
he said of the man who passed the hat at a coloured campmeeting When
asked how much he had collected he replied I didnt get no money but
Ise done got de hat back Youve got your hat back and thats about
all However with Miss Darrows permission I shall go back to the
starting point and begin all over again

You are making me your debtor Gwen replied slowly beyond my power
ever to repay you

It is in the hope that no payment may ever be demanded of you he
rejoined that I am busying myself in your affairs The colour sprang
to Gwens cheeks but she only replied by a grateful glance I knew what
was passing through her mind She was thinking of her promiseof her
fathers last words and of the terrible possibilities thereof from
which Maitland was seeking to rescue her She felt that she could safely
owe him any debt of gratitude however great while he on his part
took what I fancied both then and afterward were unnecessary pains to
assure her that in the event of his finding the assassin she need have
no fear of his making any claim whatsoever upon her And so the whole
affair was dropped for the time being and the rest of the evening
devoted to listening to Maitlands account of his experiences while
abroad

The next morning I called upon our detective at his laboratory and asked
him what he intended to do next He replied that he had no plans as yet
but that he wished to review with me all the evidence at hand

You see he said the thing that renders the solution of this mystery
so difficult is the fact that all our clues while they would be of the
utmost service in the conviction of the assassin had we found him are
almost destitute of any value until he has been located Add to this
that we are now unable to find any motive for the crime and you can
see how slight are our hopes of success If ever we chance to find the
manfor I feel that such a consummation would result more from chance
than from anything elseI think we can convict him

Here for example he said taking up a small slip of glass which
he had cut from the eastern parlour window of the Darrow house is
something I have never shown either you or Miss Darrow It is utterly
worthless so far as assisting us to track the assassin is concerned
but if ever we suspect the right man the evidence on that glass would
probably convict him though there were ten thousand other suspects

I took the glass from him and examining it with the utmost care
I detected a smutch of yellowish paint upon it nothing more For
Heavens sake Maitland I said in astonishment of what possible use
can that formless daub of paint be or is there something else on the
glass that has escaped me He laughed at my excitement as he replied

There is nothing there but the paint spot Regarding that however
you have come to a very natural though erroneous conclusion It is not
formless and he passed me a jewellers eyeglass to assist me in a
closer examination He was right The paint lay upon the glass in little
irregular furrows which arranged themselves concentrically about a
central oval groove somewhat imperfect in shape Well continued
Maitland as I returned him the magnifying glass what do you make of
it If you hadnt already attached so much importance to the thing I
said I should pronounce it a daub of paint transferred to the glass by
somebodys thumb but as such a thing would be clearly useless I am at
a loss to know what it is

Well he rejoined youve hit the nail on the headthats just what
it is but you are entirely wrong in your assumption that the thumbmark
can have no value as evidence Do you not know that there are no two
thumbs in the world which are capable of making indistinguishable
marks I was not aware of this How do you know I asked that this
mark was made by the assassin It seems to me there can hardly be a
doubt that one of the painters while priming the sill accidentally
pressed his thumb against the glass His hands would naturally have been
painty and this impression would as naturally have resulted

What you say replied Maitland is very good so far as it goes
My reasons for believing this thumbmark was made by the assassin are
easily understood First there was another impression of a thumb in the
moist paint of the sill directly under that upon the glass Both marks
were made by the same thumb and in the lower one the microscope
revealed minute traces of gravel dust not elsewhere discernible upon
the sill The thumb carried the dust there and was the thumb of the
hand pressed into the gravelthe hand of which I have a cast You see
how this shows how the thumb came to have paint upon it when pressed
upon the glass Second the two men engaged in priming the house James
Cogan and Charles Rice were the only persons save the assassin known to
have been upon that side of the house the day of the murder Here
he said carefully removing two strips of glass from a box are the
thumbmarks of Cogan and Rice made with the same paint You see that
neither of these men could by any possibility have made the mark upon
the glass So there you are But we are missing the question before us
What line of procedure can you suggest Doc Im all at sea

We must find someone I said who could have had a motive This
someone ought to have a particularly good reason for concealing his
footprints and is evidently lame besides I cant for the life of me
see anything else we have to go by unless it be the long nail of the
little finger and I dont see how that is going to help us find the
assassinunless we can find out why it was worn long If we knew that
it might assist us As I have already suggested a Chinaman might have
a long nail on the little finger but he would also have the other nails
long wouldnt he Furthermore he might use the boards to conceal the
prints of his telltale footgear but why should he not have put on
shoes of the ordinary type If he had time to prepare the boardsthe
whole affair shows premeditationclearly he had time to change his
boots The Chinese are usually small and this might easily account for
the smallness of the hand as shown by your cast These are the pros and
cons of the only clue that suggests itself to me By the way Maitland
its a shame we did not try before it was too late to track this
fellow down with a dog

Ah he replied there is another little thing I have not told you
After you had left the house with Miss Darrow on the night of the
murder and all the servants had retired I locked the parlour securely
and quietly slipped out to look about a bit As you know the moon was
very bright and any object moderately near was plainly visible I went
around to the eastern side of the house where the prints of the hand
and boards were found and examined them with extreme care What I
particularly wished to learn was the direction taken by the assassin as
he left the house and the point at which he had removed the boards from
his feet The imprints of the boards were clearly discernible so far as
the loose gravel extended but beyond that nothing could be discovered
I sat down and pondered over the matter I had about concluded to drive
two nails into the heels of my boots to enable me to distinguish my own
footprints from any other trail I might intersect and then starting
with the house as a centre to describe an involute about it in the hope
of being able to detect some one or more points where my course crossed
that of the assassin when I remembered that my friend Burwell whose
Uncle Toms Cabin Combination recently stranded at Brockton was at home
As you are perhaps aware an Uncle Tom Company consists of a Legree
one or two Markses one or two Topsies Uncle Tom a Little Eva
who should not be over fifty years oldor at least should not appear
to betwo bloodhounds and anybody else that happens to be available
It really doesnt make the least difference how many or how few people
are in the cast I have heard that an Uncle Tom manager on a Western
circuit most of whose company deserted him because the ghost never
walked succeeded in cutting and rewriting the piece so as to double
George Harris and Legree Marks and Topsy Uncle Tom and
Little Eva As for the rest he had it so arranged that he could
himself get off the door in time to do with the aid of the dogs
all the other characters You see the dogs held the stage while he
changed say from Eliza to Evas father George Harris would look
off left second entrance and say that Legree was after him Then he
would discharge a revolver rush off right first entrance where he
would pass his weapon to Eva and Uncle Tom and this bisexual
individual would discharge it in the wings at the imaginary pursuer
while Harris would put on a wire beard slouch hat black melodramatic
cape and rushing behind the flat enter left as Legree

The hardest thing to manage was the death of Little Eva with Uncle
Tom by the bedside but managerial genius overcame the difficulty
after the style of Mantells Corsican Brothers You see it is all easy
enough when you know how Little Eva is discovered sitting up in bed
with the curtains drawn back She says what she has to say to her father
and the rest Then her father has a line in which he informs Eva that
she is tired and had better try to sleep She says she will try just to
please him and he gently lowers her back upon the pillows and draws the
curtains in front of the bed But instead of utilising this seclusion
for a refreshing sleep Eva rolls out at the back side of the bed
Legree snatches off Evas wig and Topsy deftly removes the white
nightdress concealing hisEvasUncle Tom makeup while the
erstwhile little girl hastily blackens his face and hands puts on a
negro wig and in less than a minute is changed in colour race and
sex He gets round left and enters the sick room as Uncle Tom with
Topsy They are both told that Little Eva is asleep and Topsy
peeps cautiously between the curtains and remarks that the childs
eyes are open and staring The father looks in and overcome by grief
informs the audience that his child is dead Topsy tearful and
griefstricken gets off right and washes up to do Little Eva
climbing the golden stair in the last tableau Meanwhile Uncle Tom
in a paroxysm of grief throws himself upon the bed and holds the stage
till he smells the red fire for the vision then he staggers down stage
strikes an attitude the others do likewise picture of Little Eva
curtain Talk about doubling Marcellus Polonius Osric and
the First Grave Digger Why thats nothing to these Uncle Tom
productions But hold on where did I get sidetracked Oh yes the
dogs

Well as I was saying as soon as I thought of Burwell I made up my
mind at once to borrow one of his hounds It was late when I got to his
house When I knocked at the door both Pompey and Caesar began subbass
solos of growls and Burwell was awake in a minute I told him I wanted
a dog for private business and took Caesar off with me He found the
trail with no difficulty and followed it in a beeline down to the
water where he raised his big muzzle and howled in dismal impotency
The assassin had taken to the water I took the dog up and down the
shore to see if he had returned to land but all I found of interest was
a clump of alders from which a pole had been cut I knew by the dogs
actions that the assassin had been there for Caesar immediately took
a new trail back to the house Try as I might I could learn nothing
further and I at once returned the dog There is no doubt that the
murderer made his escape in a boat and took with him the pole he had
cut the boards he had worn and everything else I dare say connected
with his crime One thing seems clear and that is that we are dealing
with no ordinary criminal I would wager a good deal that this fellow
if ever he is caught will be found to be a man of brains I dont place
much confidence in the Chinese theory Doc but as I have nothing better
to offer let us go see Miss Darrow If her father has ever had any
dealings with Chinamen we shall probably deem it wise to look the
Orientals up a bit

We immediately acted upon this suggestion waiting upon Gwen at my
house She said she and her father had spent a year in San Francisco
when she was about seven years of age While there their household was
looked after by two Chinese servants named Wah Sing and Sam Lee The
latter had been discharged by her father because of his refusal to
perform certain minor duties which through oversight had not been
set down as part of his work when he was engaged So far as she knew no
altercation had taken place and there were no hard feelings on either
side Sam Lee had bade her goodbye and had seemed sorry to leave
notwithstanding which however he refused with true Chinese
pertinacity to assume the new duties She did not think it likely that
either of these Chinamen had been instrumental in her fathers death
yet she agreed with Maitland that it would be a point gained to be
assured of this fact Maitland accordingly determined to depart at once
for San Francisco and the next day he was off

We received no letters from him during his absence and were
accordingly unable to tell when he expected to get back Since his
return from India Gwen had given evidence of a reviving interest in
life but now that he was again away she relapsed into her old listless
condition from which we found it impossible to arouse her Alice who
did her utmost to please her was at her wits end She could never tell
which of two alternatives Gwen preferred since that young lady would
invariably express herself satisfied with either and did not seem to
realise why she should be expected to have any choice in the matter
Alice was quite at a loss to understand this state of affairs until I
told her that Gwen was in a condition of semitorpor in which even the
effort of choice seemed an unwarrantable outlay She simply did not care
what happened She felt nothing save a sense of fatigue and even what
she saw was viewed as from afarand seemed to her a drama in which she
took no other part than that of an idle tired and listless spectator
Clearly she was losing her hold on life I told Alice we must do our
utmost to arouse her to stimulate her will to awaken her interest and
we tried many things in vain

Maitland had been gone I think about three weeks when my sister and
I hit upon a plan which we thought might have the desired effect upon
Gwen Before her fathers death she had been one of the most active
members of a Young Peoples Club which devoted every Wednesday evening
to the study of Shakespeare She had attended none of its meetings since
her bereavement but Alice and I soon persuaded her to accompany us on
the following week and I succeeded by a little quiet wirepulling in
getting her appointed to take charge of the following meeting which was
to be devoted to the study of Antony and Cleopatra When informed
of the task which had been imposed upon her Gwen was for declining the
honour at once and the most Alice and I were able to do was to get her
to promise to think it over a day or so before she refused

The next morning Maitland walked in upon us He had found both of Mr
Darrows former servants and satisfied himself that they were in San
Francisco on the night of the murder So that ended my Chinese clue
While Alice and Gwen were discussing the matter I took occasion to draw
Maitland aside and told him of Gwens appointment to take charge of the
Cleopatra night and how necessary it was to her health that she should
be aroused from her torpor It doesnt take long for Maitland to see a
thing and before I had whispered a dozen sentences he had completely
grasped the situation He crossed the room drew a chair up beside Gwen
and sat down Miss Darrow he began I am afraid you will have a poor
opinion of me as a detective This is the second time I have failed I
feel that I should remind you again of our compact at least that part
of it which permits you to dispense with my services whenever you
shall see fit to do so and at the same time to relieve you from your
obligation to let me order your actions I tell you frankly it will
be necessary for you to discharge me if you would be rid of me for
unless you do so or I find the assassin I shall never cease my search
so long as I have the strength and means to conduct it What do you
say Have I not proved my uselessness This was said in a tentative
halfjesting tone Gwen answered it very seriously

You have done for me she said in the deep vibrating tones of her
rich contralto voice all that human intelligence could suggest
You have examined the evidence and conducted the whole affair with a
thoroughness which I never could have obtained elsewhere That your
search has been unavailing is due not to any fault of yours but rather
to the consummate skill of the assassin who I think we may conclude
is no ordinary criminal I do not know much of the abilities of Messrs
Osborne and Allen but I understand that M Godin has the reputation
of being the cleverest detective in America I cannot learn that he has
made any progress whatsoever in the solution of this terrible mystery
I do not feel therefore that you have any right to reproach yourself
Such hope as I have that my fathers murderer may ever be brought to
justice rests in your efforts else I should feel bound to relieve you
of a task which though selfimposed is none the less onerous and
illpaid Do not consider me altogether selfish if I ask that you still
continue the search and that Ithat I still be held to my covenant I
am aware that I can never fully repay the kindness I am asking of you
but

Maitland did not wait for her to finish Let us not speak of that he
said It is enough to know that you are still satisfied with my thus
far unsuccessful efforts in your behalf There is nothing affords me
keener pleasure than to struggle with and solve an intricate problem
whether it be in algebra geometry or the mathematics of crime and
thenwell even if I succeed I shall quit the work your debtor

He had spoken this last impulsively and when he had finished he
remained silent as if surprised and a bit nettled at his own failure
to control himself Gwen made no reply not even raising her eyes but
I noticed that her fingers at once busied themselves with the entirely
uncalledfor labour of readjusting the tidy upon the arm of her chair
and I thought that if appearances were to be trusted she was very
happy and contented at the change she had made in the bit of lacework
beneath her hands With singular good sense with which she was always
surprising me Alice now introduced the subject of the Young Peoples
Club and mentioned incidentally that Gwen was to have charge of the
next meeting Before Gwen had time to inform Maitland that she intended
to decline this honour he congratulated her upon it and rendered her
withdrawal difficult by saying I feel that I should thank you Miss
Darrow for the faithful way in which you fulfil the spirit of your
agreement to permit me to order your actions I know if you consulted
your own desires you would probably decline the honour conferred upon
you and that in accepting it you are influenced by the knowledge that
you are pursuing just the course I most wish you to follow Verily you
make my office of tyrant over you a perfect sinecure I had expected you
to chafe a little under restraint but instead I find you voluntarily
yielding to my unexpressed desires

Gwen made no reply but we heard no more of her resignation She
applied herself at once to the preparation of her paper upon Antony
and Cleopatra Maitland who like all vigorous healthy and informed
intellects was an ardent admirer of Shakespeare found time to call on
Gwen and to discuss the play with her This seemed to please her very
much and I am sure his interest in the play was abnormal He confessed
to me that every morning as he awoke the first thing which flashed
into his mind even before he had full possession of his senses was
these words of Antony

I am dying Egypt dying

He professed himself utterly unable to account for this and asked me
what I thought was the cause of it He furthermore suddenly decided that
he would ask Gwen to propose his name for membership at the next meeting
of the Young Peoples Club I hastily indorsed this resolution for I
had a vague sort of feeling that it would please Gwen

The Antony and Cleopatra night at length arrived We all attended the
meeting and listened to a very able paper upon the play One of the most
marked traits of Gwens character is that whatever she does she does
thoroughly and this was fully exemplified on the night in question
Maitland was very much impressed by some verse Gwen had written for
the occasion and a copy of which he succeeded in procuring from her I
think from certain remarks he made that it was the broad and somewhat
unfeminine charity expressed in the verse which most astonished and
attracted him but of this after what I have said you will when you
have perused it be as good a judge as I

 CLEOPATRA

 In Egypt where the lotus sips the waters
 Of everfruitful Nile and the huge Sphinx
 In awful silencemystic converse with
 The starsdoth see the pale moon hang her crescent on
 The pyramids sharp peakeen there well in
 The straits of Times perspective
 Went out by Caesarean gusts from Rome
 The lowburned candle of the Ptolemies
 Went out without a flicker in full glare
 Of noonday glory When her flame lacked oil
 Too proud was Egypts queen to be
 The snuff of Roman spirits so she said
 Goodnight and closed the book of life half read
 And little understood perchance misread
 The greater partyet who shall say Are we
 An ermined bench to call her culprit failings up
 And make them plead for mercy Or can we
 Upon whom soon shall fall the awful shadow of
 The Judgment Seat stand in her light and throw
 Ourselves that shadow Rather let fall upon
 Her memory the softening gauze of Time
 As mantle of a charity which else
 We might not serve She was a woman
 And as a woman loved What though the fierce
 Simoom blew ever hot within the sail
 Of her desire What if it shifted with
 Direction of her breath Or if the rudder of
 Her will did lean as many ways as trampled straws
 And own as little worth She was a woman still
 And queen They do best understand themselves
 Who trust themselves the least as they are wisest
 Who for their safety thank more the open sea
 Than pilot will Oh Egypts selfborn Isis
 Ought we to fasten in thy memory the fangs
 Of unalloyed distrust We know how little
 Better is Historys page than leaf whereat the ink
 Is thrown Nor yet should we forget how much
 The nearer thou than we didst come to
 The roughhewn cornerstone of Time We know
 Thy practised love enfolded Antony
 And that around the heart of Hercules
 Descendant threading through and through
 Like the red rivers of its life in tangled mesh
 No circumstance could eer unravel thou
 Didst coilthe dreamy dazzling Serpent of
 The Nile Thy sins stick jagged out
 From historys page and bleeding tear
 Fair Judgment from thy merits We perchance
 Do wrong thee Isis for that coward History
 Who binds in death his objects jaw and then
 Besmuts her name hath crossed his focus in
 Another age and paled his spreading figment from
 Our sight Thou art so far back toward
 The primal autocrat whose wish hyenalike
 Was his religion that appearing as thou dost
 On an horizon new flushed in the first
 Uncertain ray of Altruism thou seemst
 More ghost than human Yet thou lovest loving ghost
 And thy fierce parent flame thyself snuffed out
 Scarce later than the darkning of the fire
 Thou gavst to be eternal vestal of
 Thine Antonys spirit Thou didst love and die
 Of love let therefore no light tongue brazen
 In censure say that nothing in thy life
 Became thee like the leaving it The cloth
 From which humanity is cut is woven of
 The warp and woof of circumstance and all
 Are much alike We spring from out the mantle Earth
 And hide at last beneath it in the interim
 Our acts are less of us than it We are
 No judge then of thy sins thou ending link
 Of Ptolemys chain Forsooth we are too much
 Oerfilled with wondering how like to thee
 We all had been inclipt and dressed in thine
 Own age and circumstance


The exercises of the evening concluded with the reading of the familiar
poem beginning

 I am dying Egypt dying
 Ebbs the crimson lifetide fast


It was about noon the next day when Maitland called upon me See here
Doc he began at once do you believe in coincidences I informed
him that his question was not altogether easy to understand Wait a
moment he said while I explain For at least two years prior to my
recent return from California the name Cleopatra has not entered my
mind You were the first to mention it to me and from you I learned
that Miss Darrow was to have charge of the Antony and Cleopatra night
That is all natural enough But why should I on every morning since
you first mentioned the subject to me awake with Antonys words upon my
lips Why should every book or paper I pick up contain some reference to
Cleopatra Why man if I were superstitious it would seem positively
spookish I am getting to believe that I shall be confronted either by
Cleopatras name or some allusion to her every time I pick up a book
Its getting to be decidedly interesting

I have had I replied similar though less remarkable experiences
It is quite a common occurrence to learn of a thing say this morning
for the first time in ones life and then to find in the course of the
days reading three or four independent references to the same thing
Suppose we step into the library and pick out a few books haphazard
just to see if we chance upon any reference to Cleopatra

To this Maitland agreed and entering the library I pushed the Morning
Herald across the table to him saying One things as good as another
try that He started a little but did not touch the paper You will
have to find something harder than that he said pointing to the
outspread paper

I followed the direction of his finger and read

 Boston Theatre Special engagement of Miss Fanny Davenport
 For one week Beginning Monday the 12th of December Sardous
 Cleopatra

I was indeed surprised but I said nothing The next thing I handed
him was a copy of Godeys Magazine several years old He opened it
carelessly and in a moment read the following line I am dying
sweetheart dying Doesnt that sound familiar It reminds me at once
of the poetic alarm clock that wakens me every morningI am dying
Egypt dying There is no doubt that Higginsons poem suggested this
one Here is the whole of the thing as it is printed here he said and
read the following


 LOVES TWILIGHT

 I am dreaming loved one dreaming
 Of the sweet and beauteous past
 When the world was as its seeming
 Ere the fatal shaft was cast

 I am sobbing sadeyed sobbing
 At the darkly sullen west
 Of the smile of ignorance robbing
 The pale face against the breast

 I am smiling tearstained smiling
 As the sun glints on the crest
 Of the troubled wave beguiling
 Shipwrecked Hope to its long rest

 I am parting broken parting
 From a soul that I hold dear
 And the music of whose beauty
 Fades a dead strain on my ear

 I am dying sweetheart dying
 Drips lifes gold through palsied hands
 See the deadning Sun is sighing
 His last note in redning bands

 So Im sighing sinking sighing
 Flows lifes river to the sea
 Death my throbbing heart is tying
 With the strings that ache for thee


Yes I said when he had finished I shall have to admit that
immediately suggests Higginsons poem and Cleopatras name But here
try this and I threw an old copy of the Atlantic Monthly upon the
table Maitland opened it and laughed This may be mere chance Doc
he said but it is remarkable none the less See here He held
the magazine toward me and I read Cleopatras Needle The Historic
Significance of Central Parks New Monument Some of the Difficulties
that Attended its Transportation and Erection By James Theodore Wright
Ph D I was dumfounded Things were indeed getting interesting

Magazines and newspapers I said seem to be altogether too much in
your line Well try a book this time Here and I pulled the first
one that came to hand is a copy of Tennysons Poems I fancy it
will trouble you to find your reference in that Maitland took it in
silence and opening it at random began to read The result surprised
him even more than it did me He had chanced upon these verses from A
Dream of Fair Women

 We drank the Libyan Sun to sleep and lit
 Lamps which outburnd Canopus O my life
 In Egypt O the dalliance and the wit
 The flattery and the strife

 And the wild kiss when fresh from wars alarms
 My Hercules my Roman Antony
 My mailed Bacchus leapt into my arms
 Contented there to die

 And there he died And when I heard my name
 Sighd forth with life I would not brook my fear
 Of the other With a worm I balked his fame
 What else was left look here

 With that she tore her robe apart and half
 The polished argent of her breast to sight
 Laid bare Thereto she pointed with a laugh
 Showing the aspics bite


There is no doubt about that I said as he laid the book upon the
table I want to try this thing once more Here is Pascal if you can
find any reference to the Serpent of the Nile in that you neednt
go any farther I shall be satisfied and I passed the book to him
He turned the pages over in silence for half a minute or so and then
said I guess this counts as a failureno though by Jove Look
here His face was of almost deathly pallor and his finger trembled
upon the passage it indicated as he held the book toward me I glanced
with some anxiety from his face to the book and read as nearly as I
now can remember If Cleopatras nose had been shorter the entire face
of the world would have been changed

It was some minutes before Maitland fully regained his composure and
during that time neither of us spoke Well Doc he said at length
and his manner was decidedly grave even for him

What do you make of it I didnt know what to make of it and
I admitted my ignorance with a frankness at which considering my
profession I have often since had occasion to marvel I told him that
I could scarcely account for it on the ground of mere coincidence and I
called his attention to that part of The Mystery of Marie Roget where
Poe figures out the mathematical likelihood of a certain combination of
peculiarities of clothing being found to obtain in the case of two
young women who were unknown to each other If the finding of a single
reference to Cleopatra had been a thing of so infrequent occurrence as
to at once challenge Maitlands attention what was to be said when all
of a sudden her name or some reference to her seemed to stare at him
from every page he read

 There is something in this more than natural
 If philosophy could find it out

murmured Maitland more to himself than to me Come what do you
say and he turned abruptly to me with one of those searching looks so
peculiar to him in moments of excitement I see I replied that you
are determined I shall give my opinion now and here without a moments
reflection Very well you have just quoted Hamlet I will do
likewise

 There are more things in Heaven and Earth Horatio
 Than are dreamt of in your philosophy


You seem in some strange way to be dominated by the shade of Cleopatra
Now if I believed in metempsychosis I should think you were Mark
Antony brought down to date There with that present sober air of
yours youd pass anywhere for such an anachronism But to be serious
and to give you advice which is positively bilious with gravity I
should say investigate this thing fully make a study of this ancient
charmer By the way why not begin by going to see Davenport in Sardous
Cleopatra You have never seen her in it have you

In this way I succeeded in getting him out of his depressed state We
got into an argument concerning the merits of Miss Davenports work I
know of nothing Maitland would sooner do than argue and if attacked
on a subject upon which he feels strongly he is for the time being
totally oblivious of everything else For this reason I trapped him into
this argument I abominate what is now known as realism just as much
as he does but you dont have much of an argument without some apparent
difference of opinion so for the nonce I became a realist of whom
Zola himself would have been proud Why man I said realism is
truth You certainly cant have any quarrel with that I knew this
would have the effect of a red rag flaunted in the face of a bull

Truth Bah he exclaimed excitedly I have no patience with such
aesthetic hodcarriers Truth indeed Is there no other truth in art
but that coarse verisimilitude that vulgar trickery which appeals to
the eyes and the ears of the rabble Are there not psychological truths
of immensely greater importance What sane man imagines for a
moment that the pleasure he derives from seeing that greatest of all
tragedians Edwin Booth in one of Shakespeares matchless tragedies
is dependent upon his believing that this or that character is actually
killed Why even the day of the cranberryjuice dagger is long
since passed When Miss Davenport shrieks in Fedora the shriek is
literalreal you would call itand you find yourself instinctively
saying Dontdont and wishing you were out of the house When
Mr Booth as Shylock shrieks at Tubals news the cry is not real
is not literal but is suggestive and you see at once the fiendish glee
of which it is the expression The difference between the two is the
difference between vocal cords and grey matter

But surely I rejoined one doesnt want untruth one wants but he
did not let me finish

Always that cry of truth he retorted Do you not see how absurd it
is as used by your exponents of realism With a bit of charcoal some
Raphael draws a face with five lines and some photographer snaps a
camera at the same face Which would any sane man choose as the best
work of art The fiveline face of course Why Is the work of the
camera unreal Is it not more accurate in drawing more subtle in
gradation than the less mechanical picture To be sure What then
makes the superiority of the few lines of our Raphael That which makes
the superiority of all noble artits truth not on a low but on a
high plane its power of interpreting See he said fairly aglow
with excitement What does your realist do even assuming that he has
reached that nevertobeattained perfection which is the lifelong
Mecca of his desires He gives you by his absolutely realistic goes
with you and interprets its grandeur to you Stand before his canvas
and enjoy it as you would Nature herself if there Surely you say
nothing more could be desired and you clap your hands and shout
Bravo But wait a bit the other side is yet to be heard from What
does the true artist do for you by his picture of Yosemite Valley He
not only gives you a free conveyance to it but he goes with you and
interprets its grandeur to you He translates into the language of your
consciousness beauties which without him you would entirely miss It
is this very capability of seeing more in Nature than is ever perceived
by the common throng that constitutes the especial genius of the
artist and a work that is not aglow with its creators
personalitypersonality mind you not coarse realismcan never rank
as a masterpiece But come this wont do Why did you want to get me
astride my hobby

I thought it advisable to answer this question by asking another so I
said But how about Davenport Will you go

Yes he replied Anything with a Cleopatra to it interests me Ill
go now and see about the tickets and he left me

I have related Maitlands aesthetic views as expressed to me upon this
occasion not because they have any particular bearing upon the mystery
I am narrating but because they cast a strong sidelight upon the young
mans character and also for the reason that I believe his personality
to be sufficiently strong and unique to be of general interest

We went that same night to see Sardous Cleopatra I asked Maitland
how he liked the piece and the only reply he vouchsafed was I have
recently read Shakespeares treatment of the same theme




CHAPTER II


 If events spread themselves out fanwise from the past into the
 future then must the occurrences of the present exhibit
 convergence toward some historical burningpointsome focal
 centre whereat the potential was warmed into the kinetic

It was nearly a week after the events last narrated before I saw
Maitland again and then only by chance We happened to meet in the
Parker House and as he had some business pertaining to a case he was
on to transact at the Court House I walked up Beacon Street with him
There is a book or stationery store on Somerset Street just before
you turn down toward Pemberton Square As we were passing this store
Maitland espied a large photographic reproduction of some picture

Let us cross over and see what it is he said We did so It was
a photograph of L AlmaTademas painting of Antony and Cleopatra
Maitland started a little as he read the title and then said lightly
Do you suppose Doc that womans mummy is in existence I should like
to find it Ive an idea she left some hieroglyphic message for me on
her mummycase and doesnt propose to let me rest easy until I find and
translate it Now if I believed in transmigration of soulsdo you see
any mark of Antony about me Say though just imagine the spirit of
Marcus Antonius in a rubber apron making an analysis of oleomargarine
But here we are goodbye and he left me without awaiting any reply
He seemed to me to be in decidedly better spirits than formerly and I
was at the time at a loss to account for it The cause of his levity
however was soon explained for that night as Gwen my sister and I
were sitting cosily in the study according to our usual custom Maitland
walked in unannounced He had come now to be a regular visitor and I
invented not a few subterfuges to get him to call even oftener than he
otherwise would for I perceived that his coming gave pleasure to Gwen
She exhibited less depression when in his presence than at any other
time I had learned that hers was one of those deep natures in which
grief crystallises slowly but with an unconquerable persistence
Instead of her forgetting her bereavement or the sense thereof waxing
weaker by time she seemed to be drifting toward that everpresent
consciousness of loss in which the soul feels itself gradually but
surely sinking under an insupportable burdena burden so long borne
so well known that the mind no longer thinks of it The heart beats
stolidly under its load and seems to forget the time when it was not
so oppressed No one knows better than we physicians the danger of this
autocracy of grief and I watched Gwen with a solicitude at times almost
bordering on despair But as I said before she always seemed to show
more interest in affairs when Maitland was present and on the night
in question his abrupt and unexpected entrance surprised her into the
betrayal of more pleasure than she would have wished us to note and
indeed so quickly did she conceal her confusion that I was the only one
who noticed it Maitland was too busy with the news he brought

Well Miss Darrow he began at once at last your detective has got
a cluenot much of a onebut still a clue I can pick the man for
whom we are looking from among a million of his fellowsif I am ever
fortunate enough to get the chance

Somebody has already called attention to the fact that women are more
or less curious and there are wellauthenticated cases on record
where this inquisitiveness has even extended to things which did not
immediately concern themselves so I have little doubt I shall be
believed when I say the women folk were in a fever of expectancy and
besought Maitland with an earnestness quite unnecessaryit would have
required a great deal to have prevented his telling itto begin at
the beginning and relate the whole thing He readily acceded to this
request and began by telling them the experiences which I have just
narrated It was he said during the last act of Sardous Cleopatra
that the idea had suddenly come to him to change the plan of search from
the analytical to the synthetical

You see he continued I had from the first been trying to find the
assassin without knowing the exact way in which the crime was committed
I now determined to ascertain how under the same circumstances I could
commit such a crime and leave behind no other evidences of the deed
than those which are in our possession I began to read detective
stories with all the avidity of a Western Union Telegraph messenger
and of course read those by Conan Doyle The assertion of Sherlock
Holmes that there is no novelty in crime that crimes like history
repeat themselves and that criminals read and copy each others
methods deeply impressed me and I at once said to myself If our
assassin was not original whom did he copy

It was while reading The Sign of the Four which I had procured at
the Public Library that I made the first discovery The crime therein
narrated had been committed in such a singular manner that it at once
attracted my attention The victim had apparently been murdered without
anyone having either entered or left the room In this respect it was
like the problem we are trying to solve Might not this book I said to
myself have suggested to your fathers assassin the course he pursued
I concluded to go to the library and ask for a list of the names of
persons who had taken out this book for a few months prior to your
fathers death I was fully aware that the chance of my learning
anything in this way was very slight In the first place I reasoned
that it was not especially likely your fathers murderer had read
The Sign of the Four and in the second place even if he had
what assurance had I that he had read this particular copy of it
Notwithstanding this however I felt impelled to give my synthetical
theory a fair experimental trial I was informed by the Library
attendants that the book had been much read and given the list of some
twenty names of persons who had borrowed the book during the time I had
specified With these twentyodd names before me I sat down to think
what my next step should be I went carefully over this chain of
reasoning link by link I wish to find a certain murderer and have
adopted this method in the hope that it may help me If I derive any
assistance at all from it it will be because my man has read this
particular copy of this work therefore I may as well assume at the
start that among these twentyodd names is that of the man I want Is
there any possibility of this crime having been committed by a woman
was my next question and my answer was Yes a possibility but it
is so decidedly improbable that I may count it out for the time being
Accordingly I set aside all the female names which cut my list down
to eighteen Several of the applicants had only signed the initials of
their given names and the attendant copying them from the slips
had done likewise so I was obliged to go to the registration clerk to
determine this question of sex and while there I also ascertained the
age of each applicantthat is of all but two The registrar could give
me no information regarding J Z Weltz or B W Rizzi When I told
him that one of the clerks had copied the names for me from application
slips he informed me that if I would go back to her I would undoubtedly
find she had taken the two lastmentioned names from the green slips
used in applying for books for hall use as neither J Z Weltz nor B
W Rizzi was a cardholder

I decided to let these two names rest a while and to give my attention
to the others After careful deliberation I felt reasonably sure your
fathers assassin could not fail to be a man of mature judgment and
extraordinary cunning probably a man past middle lifeat all events
I could safely say he was over twentyone years of age Proceeding
upon this assumption my list was reduced to ten names But how should I
further continue this process of exclusion This was the question which
now confronted me I could think of but one way apart from personally
making the gentlemens acquaintance which I did not then wish to do
and that was to ascertain what other books they had borrowed immediately
before and after they had read The Sign of the Four This was the
course I determined to pursue

If you ask me why I so persistently followed an investigation a
successful outcome of which anyone must recognise would be little short
of miraculous I can only say that I felt impelled to do so Perhaps the
impulse was due to my habit of testing patiently and thoroughly each
new theory which impresses me as having any degree of probability and
perhaps it was due to something elseCleopatra perhaps eh DoctorI
dont know I determined however to thoroughly satisfy myself
regarding these ten men I made a careful list with the assistance of
an attendant of ten books taken by each man five taken just prior to
The Sign of the Four and the other five just following it I made no
deductions until the list was completed although I began to see certain
things of interest as we worked upon it At length the whole hundred
titles were spread before me and I sat down to see what I could make of
them I purposely reserved consideration of the books borrowed by Weltz
and Rizzi until the last because I had been able to learn nothing
of them and considered therefore that they were the most difficult
persons in the list about whom to satisfy myself I found the other
eight exhibited no system in their reading One had readI think I can
remember the books in the order in which they were borrowedThelma
Under Two Flags David Copperfield The Story of an African Farm
A Study in Scarlet The Sign of the Four The Prisoner of Zenda
The Dolly Dialogues The Yellow Aster The Superfluous Woman and
Ideala This is a fair sample of the other seven Not so however
with Messrs Weltz and Rizzi The reading of these men at once impressed
me as having a purpose behind it

I will read you a list of the books taken by Weltz and Rizzi just to
see what you will make out of it

There do you wonder that the perusal of that list excited me Come
now before I go any further tell me what you make of it Doc and he
passed it to me

There seems to me to be a singular unanimity of purpose existing
between these two men I said not only as regards the subjectmatter
of their reading but in no less than six cases they have both perused
the same volume This never happened by chance Clearly they are
acquaintances and are working together toward some common end I
should think it very likely judging from their interest in cancers and
toxicology that they were medical students Numbers four and five dont
exactly seem to strengthen my medical hypothesis but they are only two
out of the ten Thats about all I can make out of it and I returned
the list to him

Your views in the matter replied Maitland are precisely those which
first occurred to me and I am not sure but I should still hold them
had I been obliged to decide solely from the evidence I have submitted
to you It was clear to my mind from the first that some common purpose
actuated both Weltz and Rizzi With a view to ascertaining where they
lived as a preparatory step toward learning more of them I consulted a
Boston directory only to learn that it contained no such names I was
about to examine some of the directories of neighbouring towns when it
occurred to me that the easiest way to find their places of residence
would be to consult the green slips upon which they had procured their
books and I accordingly asked the attendant to kindly let me look at
them While she was collecting the slips I reexamined the list of books
taken by Weltz and Rizzi especially those which had been taken by both
men One thing at once struck my attention and that was that most of
these latter were large books which would take a long time to peruse and
would require to be borrowed several times for hall use were they to
be examined with any care I put this fact down for future reference
and gave my attention to the green slips the whole twenty of which the
attendant now placed before me The residence of Weltz was given as No
15 Staniford Place Boston while that of Rizzi was No 5 Oak Street
Boston I was about to walk over to Oak Street to see if Rizzi were
still there when in returning the slips to the attendant I noticed
a peculiarity in Weltzs z which I had thought I had seen in Rizzis
signature I immediately compared the slips There was the same oddly
shaped z in both It was made like thisand he handed us a slip of
paper with this z upon it

You see he continued it is so unusual a way of making the letter
that it at once attracted my attention notwithstanding the fact that
Rizzi wrote with his left hand Closer examination revealed other
peculiarities as in the rs common to both hands Well to make a
long story short I satisfied myself that the same person wrote the
whole twenty slips and was moreover ambidextrous This I considered
as a very promising discovery so much so indeed that I gave up an
engagement I had for the evening and decided to camp right there until
the Library closed Happily the books I had been consulting were still
on the table I picked out those borrowed under the names of Weltz and
Rizzi and began a most careful examination of them I had been working
about two hours when I discovered something that fairly took my breath
away I was not sure that I was right but I knew that if my microscope
bore me out I would be able to stake my life that the murderer of John
Darrow had read that book I was aware however that even then I should
not be able to name the man who had put his mark upon the book but I
could take oath that the record was made by the same hand that committed
the murder


 Transcribers note the symbols designated z and r are shown as
script which is not reproducible here 


I was too excited to do more till this had been settled so I besought
the official in charge to let me take all the books home with me if
only for a day explaining to him the vital importance of my request
He readily consented and I hastened home with the whole lot You may
imagine with what interest I put the page I wished to examine under my
microscope and laid beside it the piece of glass which you will perhaps
remember I cut from a window of the room in which the murder was
committed I believe I have never yet explained to Miss Darrow why I
preserved that bit of glass There were two reasons for it The house
had been primed that day and there were two smutches of paint upon the
glass and two almost identical smutches upon the sill One was a sinuous
line as if the glass had been struck with a short bit of ropeor
possibly rubber tubing since no ropelike texture was visiblewhich
had previously been soiled with the paint from the sill The other mark
was that of a human thumb I had seen at the Worlds Fair an exhibit
of these thumbmarks collected by a Frenchman who has made an exhaustive
study of the subject and had learned there for the first time that no
two thumbs in the world can make the same mark I knew therefore that
this slip of glass would at any time tell me whether or not a suspected
man were guilty I had not failed to get the thumbmarks of the men who
painted the house on that day as well as those of every other person
known to be about the place The marks upon the glass could not by
any possibility have been made by any of them The deduction was
inevitable They were made by the man who stood by the window when the
murder was committed

You will be surprised when I tell you it was some moments before I
could summon up courage to look through my microscope upon the page
beneath it You see I had been seized by an unaccountable conviction
that I had at last found a real clue to the murderer and I dreaded
lest the first glance should show this to have been an idle delusion At
length I looked The thumb that had pressed the paper was the thumb that
had pressed the glass There was not a doubt of it My suspicions were
confirmed Everything now regarding this book was of immense importance
The page upon which the mark was foundwell I think you would open
your eyes if I were to read it to you I will defer this pleasure
however till I see if my suspicions are correct The thumbmark is upon
page 469 of Poisons Their Effects and Detection by Alexander Wynter
Blyth

No sooner had I made sure of my discovery than I set out for No 5 Oak
Street the address given by Rizzi There was no such person there nor
had there been anyone of that name in the house during the three years
of the present tenants occupancy I went to 15 Staniford Place with the
same result A young woman about twentyfive years of age came to the
door She informed me that she had been born in the house and had always
lived there She had never known anyone by the name of Weltz This was
just what I had expected The man for whom we are searching is shrewd
almost beyond belief and if we succeed in finding him it will not we
may be assured be the result of any bungling on his part

I have now told you all I have learned or rather all that is
sufficiently definite to communicateit is not much yet it is a clue
and may serve to give our hope a new lease of life What do you think of
it Miss Darrow

I think what you have learned Gwen replied will be of the utmost
importance You have now something definite to guide you I am most
fortunate in having the services of such a detectiveindeed I am at
a loss to know how to thank you for all you have donefor all you are
doing I

My dear Miss Darrow Maitland interrupted I need no thanks Be
assured I am selfish in all I do It is a pleasure to me therefore I
do it You see I deserve no credit If I am able to free you from the
danger of sacrificing yourself I shall be more than repaid

Gwen made no reply but I sitting as I did close beside her saw the
moisture gather between her drooping lids Maitland took his leave
almost immediately having he said a long evenings work before him
while Gwen Alice and I discussed the news he had brought us until far
into the night I did not see him the next day which was Tuesday and
I believe not on Wednesday It was Thursday afternoon if I do not
mistake that he sent me a note asking me to call on him at his office
I went at once thinking it might be something very important I found
him alone and waiting for me

I wanted he began as soon as I was seated to talk this matter over
with you You see the great difficulty which besets me in this case is
that nearly all our evidence while it is of a nature to enable us to
convict our man once we have him is yet of almost no assistance to us
in finding him What do we know of him up to date or at least of what
do we feel reasonably assured Let us see John Darrow was poisoned in
some mysterious way by a man who was stationed just outside the partly
opened window The weapon or whatever was used as such was taken away
by the murderer Nothing in the nature of a projectile could have been
employed since the wound was upon a part of the victims throat known
to have been turned away from the window and to have been completely
shielded upon that side by the high and massive back of the chair in
which the victim sat

He was fully eight feet from the casement so that the assassin could
not have reached in and struck him There were no footprints by the
window as the assassin had strapped small boards upon his feet It
is most likely therefore that he has some peculiarity about his feet
which he thought best to conceal He is about five feet five inches
tall weighs about one hundred and thirtyfive pounds and steps three
or four inches longer when the right foot is thrown forward than he does
when the left foot leads We have a cast of the assassins hand showing
unmistakable evidence of the habit of biting the nails with the
exception of that of the little finger which nail by the way is
abnormally long and could only have been spared for some special
reason The murderer is most likely a foreigner His handwriting would
indicate this even if we did not know from the books he read how
conversant he is with at least one foreign tongue Again he has some
decided interest in the subject of cancers and perhaps some interest
in legerdemain if we may judge from his perusal of Robert Houdins
book

There are one or two other things I have learned but this so far as
any present effect is concerned is about all we know and it doesnt
seem to make the conduct of our search a very easy matter We have
clearly to deal with a man who is possessed not merely of low criminal
cunning but I have reason to believe with one who has education and
culture and if anything can be judged from handwriting rare strength
of character as well If we could only find some motive No one but a
maniac would do such a deed without a motive yet we cant find one
A maniac By Jove I hadnt thought of that What do you think of the
idea Though this be madness yet there is method int eh

I told him that the maniac theory did not appeal to me very strongly
Madness to be sure is often exceedingly cunning I said but it
is hardly capable of such sustained masterfulness as our criminal has
evinced

Look here Doc Maitland said breaking out suddenly Ive an idea
Might not this fellows interest in cancers be due to his having one
himself Suppose you make a canvass of the specialists on cancer in
Boston and vicinity and see if any of them remember being consulted by
a patient answering the description with which I will provide you In
addition to this I will insert an ad in the papers calling attention to
a new method for the cure of cancer and asking all interested to call
at your office for further particulars The plan does not promise much
still it may bring him What do you say

I expressed my willingness to do all in my power to aid him and he
left me The next mornings papers contained the advertisement and I
had several calls in answer to it These would have caused me much
inconvenience had I not explained the whole ruse in confidence to a
medical friend who made a specialty of the treatment of cancers and
persuaded him to come to my office during the hours specified in the
advertisement When a patient would call I would satisfy myself that it
was neither the person we were searching for nor anyone sent by him to
make inquiries and then turn him over to my colleague Dr Rhodes It
would never have occurred to me to interest myself in any patient
who did not answer the description given me by Maitland had he not
especially cautioned me in this regard

We have he said to deal with a man possessed of ability of no
common order We have already seen that he never runs a risk however
slight which he can avoid It is more than likely therefore if our
advertisement meets his eye and interests him he will inquire into it
through some second party Again we are by no means certain that his
interest in cancers is a purely personal one Perhaps it is a wife a
sister or some other relative who is afflicted In this case we could
hardly expect him to come himself Let me caution you therefore
to closely scrutinise all applicants and question them until you are
satisfied they are in nowise connected with the man for whom we are
searching

I followed this advice most carefully and had no difficulty in
convincing myself that none of my callers had any relation whatsoever
with the murderer of John Darrow This order of things was continued for
several days with the same result In the meantime Maitland was working
upon a new clue he had discovered He would tell me all about it he
said when he had followed it to the end This was on Tuesday On Friday
he came to the house and informed us that he had met a man who had
known a M Henri Cazot a Frenchman whose description seemed to tally
perfectly with nearly all we knew of Mr Darrows murderer

It came about in this way Maitland began in response to Gwens
request that he should tell us all about it I determined to thoroughly
search every book on the WeltzRizzi list to see if I might not get
some additional clue In the work by Robert Houdin entitled The
Sharper Detected and Exposed I found the statement that gamblers often
neutralised a cut in a pack of cards by a rapid and dexterous sleight
This the book went on to say was accomplished in the following manner
When the cards are cut and left in two packets upon the table the
sharper picks up with his right hand the parcel of cards which was
originally at the bottom of the pack This is brought above the other
packet as in an honest cut but just before releasing the cards the
lower parcel is deftly tilted up by inserting the right little finger
under it and the upper packet quickly slid beneath it leaving the
cards in precisely the position they occupied before cutting For this
purpose the book continued the nail of the right little finger is
worn very long so as to facilitate its being thrust beneath a packet of
cards Here I said to myself is a possible explanation of one of
the peculiarities of my plaster cast The long nail on the left little
finger may have served its function at the gaming table If so however
it would seem to indicate that our man is lefthanded while as we have
already seen the writing upon the library slips would indicate that he
is ambidextrous We need not therefore I reasoned be surprised if
we find that both little fingers have long nails I at once acted upon
these thoughts and began a search of the gambling resorts of this
city In order not to excite suspicion I played a little in each place
watching my opportunity to engage the proprietor in conversation In
every case I followed the same formula Did he remember the gentleman
who used to come there Foreignerspoke French a little under medium
height had a sort of halt in his walk bit his finger nails etc
etc I met with no encouragement in the downtown places though the
proprietor of one of the Hayward Place dives had an idea such a man
had been there but only once or twice and he was not sure he could
place him I then went up to the South End and on Decatur Street found
a man who promptly responded to my inquiries Gad thats Henri Cazot
fast enough in all but the height and gait Dick there hell tell you
all about him He owes him a little debt of honour of about a hundred
plunks He gave him his note for it and Dick carries it around with
him not because he thinks hell ever get it but he likes the writing
M Henri Cazot eh Dick and he burst into a coarse laugh I turned
to Dick for further information He had already produced a muchcrumpled
paper and was smoothing it out upon the table

Theres the article he said bringing his hand down emphatically
upon it The cuss was hard up Luck had gone agin him and he had lost
every cent he had Jem Macey was adealin and Cazot didnt seem to
grasp that fact but kept bettin heavy You see young feller ye aint
over likely to win at cards when yer playin agin the dealer Cazot
didnt know this and I wouldnt tell him for he was rather fly with the
cards himself when he want watched too close Well he struck me for a
loan said his little girl was hungry and he hadnt a cent to buy bread
Gad but he looked wild though I always thought he was moren half
loony Well as I had helped to fleece him I lent him a hundred and took
this here note Thats the last I ever see of M Henri Cazot and he
handed the paper to me I glanced at the signature It was the same hand
that had written Weltz and Rizzi upon the library slips There
was that unmistakable z and the peculiar r which had just attracted my
attention It required considerable effort on my part to so restrain my
feelings as not to appear especially interested in what I had learned
I think however I succeeded as they freely answered my questions
regarding Cazot and the daughter of whom he had spoken They knew
nothing further they said than what they had told me

It was a year ago come next month that I lent him the money my
informant continued He pocketed it hurried out and that is the last
I have ever seen or heard of him Shouldnt wonder if hed blown his
brains out long ago He used to have a mighty desperate look at times
He was one of them Monte Carlo fellers I reckon

Thats all I have been able to learn thus far It isnt very much but
it shows we are on the right track By the way Doc Im going to change
that ad tomorrow offering treatment by letter Perhaps our man is
too shy to apply in person At all events well give the other method a
trial




CHAPTER III


 When we least expect it the Ideal meets us in the street of the
 Commonplace and locks arms with us Nevermore shall we choose
 our paths uninfluenced A new leaven has entered our personality
 to dominate and direct it

The new advertisement duly appeared and on the next day which was
WednesdayI remember it because it was my hospital dayI received
several written answers and among them one in which I felt confident I
recognised the peculiar zs and rs of Weltz and Rizzi

I took it at once to Maitland He glanced at it a moment and then
impulsively grasped my hand By Jove Doc he exclaimed if this
crafty fox doesnt scent the hound we shall soon run him to earth You
see he has given no address and signs a new name We are to write to
Carl Cazenove General Delivery Boston Good we will do so at once
and I will then arrange with the postal authorities to notify me when
they deliver the letter Of course this will necessitate a continuous
watch perhaps for several days of the general delivery window It is
hardly likely our crafty friend will himself call for the letter so
it will be imperative that someone be constantly on hand to shadow
whomsoever he may send as a substitute May I depend on your assistance
in this matter

I will stand by you till we see the thing through I said though I
have to live in the Post Office a month

Well I wrote and mailed the decoy letter and Maitland explained the
situation to the postal authorities who furnished us a comfortable
place inside and near the general delivery window They promised to
notify us when anyone called for our letter Our vigil was not a very
long one On Thursday afternoon the postal clerk signalled to us that
Carl Cazenoves mail had been asked for and while he was consuming
as much time as possible in finding our letter Maitland and I quietly
stepped out into the corridor The sight that met our gaze was one
for which we had not been at all prepared There at the window stood a
beautiful young girl just on the verge of womanhood Her frank blue eyes
met mine with the utmost candour as I passed by her so that she should
be between Maitland and me and thus unable to elude us whichever way
she turned upon leaving the window We had previously planned how we
should shadow our quarry one on each side of the street in order not to
attract attention but these tactics seemed to be entirely unnecessary
for the young lady did not have the slightest suspicion that anyone
could be in the least interested in her movements She walked leisurely
along stopping now occasionally to gaze at the shop windows and never
once turning to look back She did not even conceal the letter but held
it in her hand with her portemonnaie and I could see that the address
was uppermost A strange sensation came over me as I dogged her steps
I felt as an assassin must feel who tracks his victim into some lonely
spot where he may dare to strike him It was useless for me to tell
myself that I was on the side of justice and engaged in an honourable
errand A single glance at the girls delicate face as frank and open
as the morning light brought the hot blush of shame to my cheek In
following her I dimly felt that in some way I was seeking to associate
her with evil which seemed little less than sacrilege I could do
nothing however but keep on so I followed her through Devonshire
Street to New Washington and thence down Hanover Street almost to the
ferry Here she turned into an alleyway and waiting for Maitland to
come up we both saw her enter a house at its farther end

George glanced hastily up at the house and then said as he seized me
impatiently by the arm Its a tenement house come on the chase is
not up yet we too must go in

So in we went The young lady had disappeared but as we entered we
heard a door close on the floor above and felt sure we knew where she
had gone We mounted the stairs as noiselessly as possible and listened
in the hall We could distinguish a womans voice and occasionally that
of a man but we could not hear what passed between them On our right
there was a door partly ajar Maitland pushed it open and looked in
The room was empty and unfurnished with the exception of a dilapidated
stove which stood against the partition separating this room from the
one the young lady had entered Maitland beckoned to me and I followed
him into the room There was a key on the inside of the door which
he noiselessly turned in the lock He then began to investigate the
premises Three other rooms communicated with the one of which we had
taken possession forming evidently a suite which had been let for
housekeeping Everything was in illrepair as is the case with most
of the cheap tenements in this locality The previous tenant had not
thought it necessary to clean the apartments when quitting themfor
altruism does not flourish at the North Endbut had been content to
leave all the dirt for the next occupant

When we had finished reconnoitering we returned to the room we first
entered which apparently was the kitchen We could still hear the
voices but not distinctly Do you stay here Doc whispered Maitland
while I get into some old clothes and hunt up the landlord of this
place Im going to rent these rooms long enough to acquaint myself with
my neighbours on the other side of the wall Ill be back soon Dont
let any man leave that room without your knowing where he goes With
this he left me and I soon found a way to busy myself in his absence
In the wall above the stove where the pipe passed through the partition
into our neighbours apartment there was a chink large enough to permit
me when mounted upon the stove to overlook the greater part of the
adjacent room I availed myself of this privilege though not without
those same twinges of conscience which I had felt some minutes before
when following the young lady The apartment was poorly furnished and
yet despite this scantiness of appointment there was unmistakable
evidence of refinement Everything visible in the room was scrupulously
neat and the few pictures that adorned the walls while they were
inexpensive halftones were yet reproductions of masterpieces In the
centre of the room stood a small deal table on the opposite side of
which sat the man who had answered my letter

At one end of the table poised upon the back of a chair sat a small
Capucin monkey of the Weeper or Sai species He watched the man with
that sober judicial air which is by no means confined exclusively to
supreme benches I too observed the man carefully He was tall and
spare He must have measured nearly six feet in height and could not
I think have weighed over one hundred and fifty pounds His face was
pinched and careworn but this effect was more than redeemed by a pair
of full black eyes having a depth and penetration I have never seen
equalled albeit there was ever and anon a suggestion of wildness
which somewhat marred their deep contemplative beauty The brows and
the carriage of the head at once bespoke the scholar While thus I
watched him the young girl came from a corner of the room I could not
overlook and laid my letter before him She stood behind his chair as
he opened it smoothing his hair caressingly and every now and then
kissing him gently He paused with the open letter before him reached
up both arms drew her down to him kissed her passionately sighed
and picked up the letter again I took pains that no act word or look
should escape me This show of affection surprised me and I remember
the thought flashed through my mind What inconsistent beings we all
are Here is a man apparently capable of a causeless and coldblooded
assassination of a harmless old man You would say such a murderer
must be hopelessly selfish and brutal amenable to none of the better
sentiments of mankind and yet it needs but a casual glance to see how
his whole life is bound up in the young girl before him

While this was passing through my mind the man had glanced through my
letter and thrown it upon the table with an exclamation of disgust
Bah he has had the effrontery he said petulantly to send me what
he calls a new mode of treatment and it is in every essential that of
Broadbent well known for more than a quarter of a century New indeed
I shall never find a doctor who has any scientific acumen I may as
well abandon the search now Mon Dieu and they call medicine a science
Bah and with a frown he dropped his head despondently upon his hand
The young girl passed her hand gently soothingly over his forehead and
did not speak for nearly a minute

You are not feeling well tonight father she said at length M
Godin has been here during my absence

M Godin I exclaimed half aloud catching at the stovepipe lest
I should fall from the stove So our rival is hot upon the
scentprobably even ahead of us How on earth But I did not finish
the exclamation My seizure of the pipe upon my side of the partition
had produced an audible vibration of that portion extending over the
heads of my neighbours The young girls quick ear had detected the
sound and she had ceased speaking and fastened her eyes suspiciously
upon the aperture through which I was gazing It seemed to me as if she
must see me yet I dared not move After a little she seemed reassured
and continued I knew he had been here You are always this way after
his visits Why of late does he always come when I am away The
question seemed innocent enough yet the man to whom it was addressed
turned crimson and then as pale as ashes When he spoke the effort his
selfcontrol cost him was terribly apparent

We have private business dear he said private business He
hesitated a moment and again his eyes wore the wild look I had first
noticed I am selling him something he continued very dear to
meas dear as my hearts blood and I expect to get enough for it to
guard you from want

And you father the young girl questioned fervently I thought I
noticed a tremor run through his frame as drawing her face down to his
he said kissing her Me Never mind me Puss this cancer here will
take care of me

She made no reply but turned away to hide the tears that sprang to her
eyes As she did so she raised her face toward me I have never
been considered particularly sympatheticthat is no more than the
averagebut there was something in the expression of her face that
went to my heart like a knife I felt as if I were about to sob with
her I do not know what it was that so aroused my sympathies We are I
fancy more apt to feel for those whose beauty is like to the ideals we
have learned to love than we are to be moved by the suffering of those
whose looks repel usand this may have had something to do with my
conditionfor the young girl was radiantly beautifulyet it could
hardly have been the real cause of it

So rapt was I in the sympathetic contemplation of her that I did not see
Maitlands entrance or realise I was observed till he plucked me by the
coat and motioned me to get down I did so and he told me he had rented
the rooms and laid before me the plan he meant to pursue

As soon as he had ceased speaking I said to him George you are
undoubtedly on the right track The man in there is the one we are
looking for fast enough but I am afraid we are a bit too late

Too late he exclaimed in a tone that I feared might be overheard
What the mischief do you mean

I mean I replied that M Godin is already upon the scene

In the next ten seconds Maitland turned all colours and I edged nearer
to him expecting him to fall but he did not

M Godin he ejaculated at length How in the name of all the gods
at onceDoc hes all they claim for him and as fascinating as he is
clever at which last remark a heavy cloud passed over Maitlands face
Come he continued listlessly you may as well tell me all you know
about it

I then confided to him what I had heard and ended by asking him what he
proposed to do

Do he replied There is but one thing I can do which makes the
choice decidedly easy and he set his jaws together with a determined
expression the meaning of which I knew full well

I shall camp right here he said till I learn all I wish to know of
our neighbours yonder I have already provided myself with instruments
which will enable me to note every movement they make indeed to
photograph them if necessary and to hear and record every word they
utter You look surprised but it is easily done I will place my lenses
there at the chink through which you were gazing and bring the image
down into my camera obscura by a prism arranged for total internal
reflection As for the hearing that is easier yet I will carefully
work away the plaster on this side tonight till I get through to
the paper covering their wall This I will leave intact to use as a
diaphragm I have then only to fasten my carbon to it and behold we
have a microphone or telephonewhichever you choose to call it All I
have to look out for is that I get it high enough to avoid the danger of
the paper being accidentally broken from the other side and that I work
quietly while removing the plaster I shall of course cover it with a
bit of black felt to prevent our light from showing and to deaden any
sounds from this side This will enable us to hear all that goes on in
the other room but this may not be enough We may need a phonographic
record of what transpires

The device whereby I secure this at such a distance is an invention
of my own which for patent reasonsI might almost say patent patent
reasonsI will ask you to kindly keep to yourself To the diaphragm
there I fasten this bit of burnished silver Upon this I concentrate
a pencil of light which when reflected acts photographically upon a
sensitised moving tape in this little box and perfectly registers the
minutest movement of the receiving diaphragm How I develop etch and
reproduce this record and transform it into a record of the ordinary
type you will see in due timeand will kindly keep secret for the
present You had better go now and send me the things on this list as
soon as possible and he passed me a paper continuing

We will not despair yet Our clever rival may not be ready to prove his
case so quickly as we At all events when he comes again I shall be in
a condition to ascertain how far he has progressed I have some things
I must settle before I can ask for an arrest and I am not at all sure
that M Godin is in any better condition in this regard than I am
By Jove Id give something to know how that wizard has gotten so far
without so much as a single sign to indicate that he had even moved in
the matter I say Doc it beats me blessed if it doesnt Please say
to Miss Darrow that I am at work upon a promising cluepromising for
someone anywayand may not see her for some time yet

I did as he requested and if I am any judge of feminine indications
my message did not yield Gwen unmixed pleasure still she said nothing
to warrant such a supposition on my part I visited Maitland every day
to learn what he might wish me to bring him and also to carry him his
mail for he had determined to remain constantly on the watch at his new
quarters

I have thus far in the narration of these incidents been perfectly
candid both as regards my friends and myself and therefore that I
may continue in like manner to the end I shall suppress certain qualms
which are urging me to silence and confess myself guilty of some things
of which you will perhaps think I may well be ashamed Be that as it
may you shall have the whole truth however it may affect your opinion
of me One reason why I went to Maitlands new quarters so often and
stayed there so long was because I was always permitted to relieve him
of his watch With a telephone receiver strapped to my right ear and my
eyes fastened upon the screen of the camera obscura I would sit by the
hour prying into the affairs of the two people in the next room I tried
for a number of days to ease my conscience by telling myself that I was
labouring in the cause of justice and was not a common eavesdropper
This permitted me to retain a sort of quasi selfrespect for a day or
two till my honesty rallied itself and forced me to realise and to
admit that I was to all intents and purposes a common Paul Pry
performing a disreputable act for the gratification it gave me I
determined I would at least be honest with myselfand this was my
verdict You will perhaps fancy that when I arrived at this decision I
at once mended my ways and resigned my seat of observation to Maitlands
entirely professional care This doubtless I should have done if we
fallible human beings governed our conduct by our knowledge of what is
right and proper Inasmuch however as desires and emotions are the
determining factors of human conduct I did nothing of the sort I
simply watched there day after day with everincreasing avidity until
at length I got to be impatient of the duties that took me away and
more than half inclined to neglect them

I shall gain nothing by attempting to make you believe it was the man
in the neighbouring room that interested me so I shall not essay it
I confess with a feeling of guilt because I am not more ashamed of
itthat it was the young lady who attracted me You will I trust
assume I had enough interest in her father to palliate my conduct in a
measure Be generous in your judgment How do you know you will not be
in the same predicament Think of it A young woman beautiful beyond my
feeble powers of description her eyes of a heavenly blue her luxuriant
hair like a mass of spun gold her complexion matched to the tint and
transparency of the blush roseand such a throat From it came a voice
as musical as the unguided waters when Winter rushes down the hills in
search of Spring Never you mind thats the way I felt about it and
if you had been in my place youd have been just as bad as I come
now you know you would Suppose I was a bachelor and almost old enough
to be her father Does that help matters any Is the heart less hungry
because it has been starved Just look at your history When nuns have
relapsed from otherworldliness to thisworldliness how have they been
Ill tell you They have been just a round bakers dozen times worse
than they would have been if they had never undertaken to cheat Nature
Look at the thing fairly I dont expect to dodge any blame that I
deserve yet I do want all the palliating circumstances duly noted Many
months have passed since then and yet the thought of that sweet girl
sends a thrill all over me I wonder where she is now I feel that we
shall meet again some time and perhaps you will see her yourself
If so you will see that I couldnt be expected to withstand any such
temptation

On these visits Maitland and I talked but very little and while I
was spying nothing of interest occurredi e nothing of interest to
himor if it did things of interest to me prevented my observing it
On several occasions he alluded vaguely to things he had learned which
he said he should not divulge even to me until the proper time came

Things went on in this way for about two weeks I visited Maitland
daily and daily the little lady in the next room wove her spell around
me If as I am inclined to believe thinking a great deal of a person
is much the same thing as thinking of a person a great deal I must have
adored her

One night about a fortnight after Maitlands change of abode I found
Alice in a terrible state of excitement upon my arrival home She met me
at the door and said Gwen needed my attention at once I did not stop
to hear further particulars but hastened to the sittingroom where
Gwen lay upon the lounge She was in a stupor from which it seemed
impossible to arouse her In vain I tried to attract her attention Her
fixed staring eyes looked through me as if I had been glass I saw she
had received a severe shock and so after giving her some medicine I
took Alice aside and asked her what had happened She said that Gwen and
she had been sitting sewing by the window all the afternoon and talking
about Maitlands recent discoveries At about five oclock the Evening
Herald was brought in as usual She Alice had picked it up to glance
over the news when in the column headed Latest she had seen the
heading The Darrow Mystery Solved This she had read aloud without
thinking of the shock the unexpected announcement might give Gwen when
the sudden pallor that had overspread the young womans face had brought
her to her senses and she had paused Her companion however had
seized the paper when she had hesitated and in a fever of excitement
had read in a halfaudible voice

 John Darrow was murderedThe assassins inability to pay a
 gambling debt the motive for the crimeExtraordinary work
 of a French detectiveThe net

But at this juncture the paper had dropped from Gwens hands and she
had fallen upon the floor before Alice could reach her




THE EPISODE OF THE TELLTALE THUMB



CHAPTER I

 When Disaster is bigger than its victim its bolt oerlaps the
 innocent

It was some time after Gwen had fallen before Alice had succeeded in
getting her upon the lounge and then all her efforts to revive her had
failed She had remained in the same nerveless stupor as that in which
I had found her I asked Alice if she knew why this announcement had
produced such an effect upon Gwen and she returned my question with a
look of amazement

Have you forgotten Gwens promise to her father in this matter
she replied Has she not already told you that she should keep that
promise whatever the sacrifice cost her She is therefore entirely
at the mercy of this M Godin and she is also obliged to advise him of
this fact if she would carry out her fathers wishes Is this nothing
for a sensitive nature like hers If she has any love for anyone else
she must crush it out of her heart for she is M Godins now Surely
Ned you are not so stupid as your question would indicate

We wont discuss that I rejoined Let us go to Gwen and get her to
bed

This done and the sufferer made easy for the night I glanced at the
article which had so upset her and read its sensational scarehead
In full it ran as follows

 THE DARROW MYSTERY SOLVED
 JOHN DARROW WAS MURDERED

 The Assassins Inability to Pay a Gambling Debt the
 Motive for the Crime

 EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF A FRENCH DETECTIVE

 The Net so Completely Woven About the Alleged
 Assassin That it is Thought He Will Confess

 The Arrest Entirely Due to the Unassisted Efforts of
 M LOUIS GODIN


I did not stop to read the article but seized my hat and hastened at
once to Maitland

A copy of the Herald lay upon his table advising me that he was already
acquainted with the strange turn affairs had taken He told me that he
had heard the newsboys in the street calling out The Darrow Mystery
Solved and had at once rushed out and bought a paper

I informed him of Gwens condition and he wished to go to her at
once but I told him he must wait until the morrow as she had already
retired and was I had reason to hope fast asleep I reassured him
with the information that a nights sleep and the medicine I had given
her would probably put Gwen in full possession of her faculties Having
thus satisfied his fears I thought it fitting he should satisfy mine
I asked him what had become of the young woman in the next room He did
not reply but quietly led me into his camera obscura that I might see
for myself She was sitting at the table in the centre of the room with
her face buried in her hands I watched her for a long time and the
only movement I could discern was that occasioned ever and anon by a
convulsive catching of her breath The pet monkey was nowhere to be
seen

They took her father away early this morning Maitland said and
after the first shock she sank into this condition She has not moved
since When I see the despair her fathers arrest has occasioned I
am almost tempted to rejoice that I had no hand in it and yetwell
theres no great harm without some small goodno one will say now
that John Darrow took his own life eh What do you think our friends
Osborne and Allen will say now They were so sure their theory was the
only tenable one Ah well we should ever hold ourselves in readiness
for surprises

And for emergencies too I continued and this strikes me as being
very like one That young woman needs attention if I am any judge of
appearances and Im going in there No use Doc Maitland replied
the door is locked and she either cannot or will not open it I
knocked there for an hour hoping to be able to comfort her Its no
use for you to try she wont open the door Wont eh then Ill
go through it I exclaimed in a tone that so amazed Maitland that he
seized me by the shoulders and gazed fixedly into my face Its all
right George I said answering his look Im going in there and Im
not going to be at all delicate about my entrance either

He looked at me a little doubtfully but I could see that on the whole
he was pleased with my decision I went into the hall and knocked loudly
on the door There was no response I kicked it till I must have been
heard all over the house but still there was no response It was now
clear I should not enter by invitation so I went up four or five stairs
of the flight opposite the door and from that position sprang against
it I am not if you remember a heavy man but momentum is MV and I
made up in the V what I lacked in the M The door opened inwardly
and I tore it from its hinges and precipitated both myself and it into
the centre of the apartment As I look back upon this incident I regard
it as the most precipitous thing I ever did in the way of a professional
visit If the young lady started at all she did so before I had
gathered myself together sufficiently to notice it I spoke to her but
she gave no evidence of hearing me I raised her head Her eyes were
wide open and stared full at me yet in such a blank way that I knew she
did not hear me The contraction of the brows the knotted appearance
of the forehead and the rigor of the face told me she was under an
allbutbreaking tension There were tearstains from tears which
long since had ceased to flow The fire of fever had dried them up I
regarded her case as far more desperate than Gwens and determined to
lose no time in taking charge of it It seemed to me so like sacrilege
to touch her without an explanation that though I knew she could not
understand me I said to her as I took her in my arms You are ill
and I must take you away from here

She was just blossoming into womanhood and her form had that exquisite
roundness and grace which it is the particular function of fashion to
annihilate If I held her closely I think all bachelors will agree that
it was because this very roundness made her heavy if I did not put her
down immediately I reached Maitlands room it is because as a doctor
of medicine I have my own ideas as to how a couch should be fixed
before a patient is laid upon it Maitland may say what he pleases but
I know how important these things are in sickness and you know quick
as he is in most things George has moments when his head is so much
in the clouds that he doesnt know what he is doing and moves as if he
were in a dream set to dirge music He kept telling me to put her on
the couchput her on the couch To this day he fondly believes that
when I finally did release her it was as the result of his advice
rather than because he had at last made a suitable bed for her

I sent Maitland for some medicine which I knew would relax the
tension she was under and make it possible for her to sleep When I had
administered this Maitland and I talked the matter over and we decided
to take her at once to my house where with Gwen she could share the
watchful care of my sister Alice This we did though I was not without
some misgivings as to Gwens attitude in the matter when she should
recover sufficiently to know of it I expressed my doubts to Maitland
and he replied Give yourself no uneasiness on that score Miss Darrow
is too womanly to visit the sins of a guilty father upon an unoffending
daughter and besides this manit seems that his real name is
Latour not Cazenovehas a right to be judged innocent until his guilt
is proved

I found this to be sage counsel for when Gwen was able to understand
what I had done she exhibited no antipathy toward the new member of our
household but on the contrary became exceedingly interested in her
I was especially glad of this not only on account of Miss Latour the
suspects daughter but also because the one thing Gwen needed above all
others was something to challenge her interest She had again relapsed
into the old state of passive endurance wherein nothing seemed to
reach her consciousness Her actions appeared to flow more from her
nervecentres than from her mind She moved like an automaton There is
scarcely any condition of which I am more fearful than this The patient
becomes wax in ones hands She will do anything without a murmur or as
willingly refrain from anything She simply is indifferent to life and
all that therein is Is it any wonder then that I rejoiced to see Gwen
interest herself in poor Jeannette It was a long time however before
Jeannette repaid this interest with anything more than a dreamy faroff
gaze that refused to focus itself upon anything As time wore on
however I noticed with relief that there was a faint expression of
wonder in her look and as this daily grew stronger I knew she was
beginning to realise her novel surroundings and to ask herself if she
were still dreaming Yet she did not speak she seemed to fear the
sound of her own voice and to determine to solve unaided the mystery
confronting her I requested that no one question her or make any
attempt to induce her to break silence for I knew the time would come
when she would do so of her own free will As it happened her first
words were spoken to me and as my writing this recalls the event
a thrill of pleasurable pain passes through me You may think this
foolish the more so indeed when you learn that nothing was said
to warrant such a feeling but I must urge upon you not to let your
satisfied heart set itself up as judge in bachelor regions

I had been mixing some medicine for her and was holding the cup to her
lips that she might drink the draught She laid her hand upon my wrist
and gently put the cup aside saying as she gazed thoughtfully at me
Did you not bring me here Yes I replied She reached for the
cup and drinking its contents sank back upon the pillows with a
halfsatisfied look upon her face as if my reply had cleared up one
mystery but left many more to be solved

From this day Jeannette steadily improved and within two weeks she and
Gwen had come to a very good understanding It was plainly evident that
Alice too came in for a very good share of the little French girls
love They did not exchange confidences to any great degree for as
Maitland used to say Alice was one of those rare sweet women who say
but little but seem to act upon all around them by a sort of catalysis
sweetening the atmosphere by their very presence




CHAPTER II

 Belief though it be as ample as the ocean does not always
 similarly swell in crystallising It has however its point of
 maximum density but this not infrequently is also ifs point
 of minimum knowledge

During all these days Gwen was gaining rapidly Maitland came to visit
us almost every night and he told Gwen that he did not feel altogether
certain that in arresting M Latour the law had secured her fathers
real assassin It would be necessary to account for he told her some
very singular errors in his early calculations if M Latour was the man

When first I took up my abode under the same roof with him he said
I had no doubt that we had at last run down our man Now although
another detective has come to the same conclusion I myself have many
misgivings and you may be assured Miss Darrow that I shall lose no
time in getting these doubts answered one way or the other At present
you may say to your friend Jeannette that I am straining every nerve in
her fathers behalf

Why all this should so please Gwen I was at a loss to comprehend but I
could not fail to see that it did please her greatly She had been the
most anxious of us all to see her fathers murderer brought to justice
and now when through the efforts of M Godin a man stood all but
convicted of the crime she was pleased to hear Maitland whose efforts
to track Latour she had applauded in no equivocal way say that he
should spare no pains to give the suspect every possible chance to prove
his innocence There was certainly a reason whatever it might have
been for Gwens attitude in this matter for that young woman was
exceptionally rational in all things Nothing of especial moment
occurred between this time and the beginning of the trial Maitland for
the most part kept his own counsel and gave us little information other
than a hint that he still thought there was a chance of clearing M
Latour

With this end in view he had become an associate attorney with Jenkins
in order the better to conduct M Latours case along the lines which
seemed to him the most promising I asked him on one occasion what led
him to entertain a hope that Latour could be cleared and he replied A
good many things Well then I rejoined what are some of them
He hesitated a moment and then replied laughingly You see I hate to
acknowledge the falsity of my theories I said shortly after the murder
was committed that I thought the assassin was short and probably did not
weigh over one hundred and thirtyfive pounds that he most likely had
some especial reason for concealing his footprints and that he had a
peculiarity in his gait I felt tolerably sure then of all this but now
it turns out that M Latour is six feet tall in his stockings and thin
and that emaciated as he is he tips the scales at one hundred and
fifty pounds by reason of his large frame His feet are as commonplace
asas yours Doc and his gait as regular asmine Is it to be
expected that I am going to give up all my pet illusions without a
struggle

When the hour for the trial arrived Gwen insisted on accompanying us to
the courtroom She had a great deal of confidence in George and felt
sure that as he expressed a strong doubt of the prisoners guilt he
would triumph in proving him innocent She determined therefore to be
present at the trial even before her attendance should be required as a
witness

M Latour when he was led into the prisoners box seemed to have aged
greatly during his incarceration It was with a marked effort that he
arose and straightened himself up as the indictment was read to him
When the words Are you guilty or not guilty were addressed to him
every eye was turned upon him and every ear listened to catch the first
sound of his voice but no sound came The question was repeated more
loudly Are you guilty or not guilty Like one suddenly awakened from
a reverie M Latour started turned toward his questioner and in a
full firm voice replied Guilty I was so dumfounded that I could
offer Gwen no word of comfort to alleviate this sudden shock Maitland
and Godin seemed about the only ones in the courtroom who were not
taken off their feet so to speak by this unexpected plea and George
was at Gwens side in a moment and whispered something to her which I
could not hear but which I could see had a very beneficial effect upon
her We had all expected a long complicated trial and here the whole
matter was reduced to a mere formality by M Latours simple confession
Guilty Is it any wonder therefore that we were taken aback

While we were recovering from our surprise at this sudden turn of
affairs Maitland was engaged in private conversation with the Judge
with whom he afterward told me he had become well acquainted both in
his own cases and in those of other lawyers requiring his services as
an expert chemist He never told me what passed between them nor
the substance of any of the brief interviews which followed with
the prosecuting attorney his associate counsel and other legal
functionaries All I know is that when the case was resumed M Latours
senior counsel Jenkins kept carefully in the background leaving the
practical conduct of the case in Maitlands hands

If a hazelnut had the shell of a cocoanut its meat would in my
opinion sustain about the same relation to its bulk as the gist of the
usual legal proceeding sustains to the mass of verbiage in which it is
enshrouded For this reason you will not expect me to give a detailed
account of this trial I couldnt if I would and I wouldnt if I could
My knowledge of legal procedure is far from profound albeit I once
began the study of law My memories of Blackstone are such as need
prejudice no ambitious aspirant for legal honours I have a recollection
that somewhere Blackstone says something about eavesdroppingI mean in
its literal sensesomething about the drippings from As roof falling
on Bs estate but for the life of me I couldnt tell what he says More
distinctly do I remember this learned lawgiver stated that there could
be no doubt of the evidence of witchcraft because the Bible was full
of it and that witches should be punished with death This made an
impression upon me because it was an instance rare to me then but
common enough now of how minds otherwise exceptionally able may have
a spot so encankered with creed bigotry and superstition as to render
their judgments respecting certain classes of phenomena erroneous and
illogical puerile and ridiculous

But to return to those points of the trial which I can remember and
which I think of sufficient interest to put before you These refer
chiefly to Maitlands examination of M Latour and of the governments
chief witness M Godin Such portions of their testimony as I shall
put before you I shall quote exactly as it was given and reported by
Maitlands friend Simonds

When Maitland began for the defence he said

At about halfpast seven on the night of the 22d of April John Darrow
met his death at his home in Dorchester He died in the presence of
his daughter Messrs Willard Browne Herne and myself His death was
caused by injecting a virulent poison into his system through a slight
incision in his neck That wound the prisoner before you confesses he
himself inflicted I would like to know a little more definitely how he
succeeded in doing it without detection in the presence not only of
his victim but of five other persons sitting close about him M Latour
will please take the stand

As M Latour stepped into the witnessbox a wave of suppressed
excitement ran all over the courtroom Every nerve was strained to
its tensest pitch every ear eager for the slightest syllable he might
utter What could be done for a man who had confessed and what would be
the solution of the crime which had so long defied the authorities The
explanation was now to be made and it is no wonder that the excitement
was intense

I omit all uninteresting formalities

Q Have you ever seen me before today

A Not to my knowledge

Q Have you any reason to believe I have ever seen you before today

A None whatevererthat isunless on the night of the murder

Q Were you acquainted with John Darrow

A Yes

Q How long have you known him

A About six monthsperhaps seven

Q What were your relations

A I dont understandWe had gambled together

Q Where

A In this cityDecatur Street

Q What motive led you to kill him

A He cheated me at cards and I swore to be even with him

Q Had you any other reason

A I owed him twelve hundred and thirtyfive dollars which I borrowed
of him hoping my luck would change He won it all back from me by false
play and when I could not meet it he pressed me over hard

Q You say this occurred on Decatur Street What was the date

A I do not remember

Q What month was it

A It was in March Early in March

Q You are sure it was in March

A Yes

Q Should you say it was between the 1st and 15th of March

A Yes I am positive it was before the 15th of March

Q Have you long known that M Godin was at work upon this case

A No

Q When did you first become aware of it

A Not until my arrest

Q When did you first see M Godin

A When I was arrested

Q Did he ever call at your rooms

A Nevernot to my knowledgeI never saw him till the day of my
arrest

Q With what weapon did you kill Mr Darrow

A I made use of a specially constructed hypodermic syringe

Halfsmothered exclamations of surprise were heard from every part
of the room Even the Judge gave a start at this astounding bit of
testimony Every person present knew perfectly well that no human being
could have entered or left the Darrow parlour without certain discovery
yet here was a man apparently in his right mind who soberly asserted
that he had used a hypodermic syringe Maitland and Godin alone seemed
cool and collected Throughout all Latours testimony M Godin watched
the witness with a burning concentration It seemed as if the great
detective meant to bore through Latours gaze down to the most secret
depths of his soul Not for an instant did he take his eyes from Latour
I said to myself at the time that this power of concentration explained
in a great measure this detectives remarkable success Nothing was
permitted to escape him and little movements which another man would
doubtless never notice had for M Godin I felt sure a world of
suggestive significance

Maitlands calm demeanour so resourceful in its serenity caused all
eyes to turn at length to him as if for explanation He continued with
slow deliberation

Q In what particulars was this hypodermic syringe of special
construction

M Latour seemed nervous and ill at ease He shifted from side to side
as if M Godins glance had pierced him like a rapier and he were
trying vainly to wriggle off of it He seemed unable to disengage
himself and at length replied in a wearied and spiritless tone

A In two particulars only In the first place it was very small
having a capacity of but five or six drops and in the second place
it was provided with an internal spring which when released worked the
plunger and ejected the contents with extreme rapidity

Q What operated this spring

A Around the needlelike point of the syringe less than a quarter
of an inch from its end was a tiny annular bit of metal This little
metallic collar was forced upward by the pressure of the flesh as
the sharp point entered it and this movement released the spring and
instantly and forcibly ejected the contents of the cylinder

Q Did you use a poison in this syringe

A Yes sir

Q What did you use

M LATOUR hesitated and shifted helplessly about as if he dreaded to go
farther into these particulars and fondly hoped someone might come to
his rescue His gaze seemed to shift about the room without in the least
being able to disentangle itself from that of M Godin He remained
silent and the question was repeated

Q What did you use

Again the witness hesitated while everyone save only Maitland and
Godin leaned eagerly forward to catch his reply At length it came in a
voice scarcely above a whisper

A Anhydrous hydrocyanic acid

A longdrawn Hum escaped from Maitland while M Godin gave not the
slightest indication of surprise It was quite evident to us all that
the astute Frenchman had acquired complete control of the case before he
had arrested the assassin At this juncture the Court said addressing
Maitland

This substance is extremely poisonous I take it

Your Honour Maitland replied it is the most fatal of all poisons
known to chemists It is also called cyanhydric and more commonly
prussic acid An insignificant amount when inhaled or brought into
contact with the skin causes immediate death If a drop be placed upon
the end of a glass rod and brought toward the nose of a live rabbit he
will be dead before it reaches him

A profound silencethe deathlike quiet which accompanies an almost
breaking tensionreigned in the courtroom as Maitland turned again to
Latour

Q I understand you to say you used anhydrous hydrocyanic or cyanhydric
acid

A Yes sir

Q Do you sufficiently understand chemistry to use these terms with
accuracy Might you not have used potassium cyanide or prussiate of
potash

A I am a tolerably good chemist and have spoken understandingly
Potassium cyanide KCN is a white crystalline compound and could
hardly be used in a hypodermic syringe save in solution in which
condition it would not have been sufficiently poisonous to have served
my purpose

At this reply many of the audience exchanged approving glances They
believed M Latour had shown himself quite a match for Maitland in not
falling easily into what they regarded as a neat little trap which
had been set to prove his lack of chemical knowledge They attributed
Maitlands failure to further interrogate Latour upon his understanding
of chemistry as evidence that he had met an equal To be sure they were
not quite clear in their own minds why Latours counsel should be at
such pains to carefully examine a man who had already confessed but
they believed they knew when a lawyer had met his match and felt sure
that this was one such instance Clinton Browne who sat in one of the
front seats seemed to find a deal more to amuse him in this incident
than was apparent to me Some men have such a wonderful sense of humour

Maitland continued

Q When Mr Darrow was murdered he sat in the centre of his parlour
surrounded by his daughter and invited guests Will you tell the Court
how you entered and left this room without detection

Again the witness hesitated and looked irresolutely almost tremblingly
about him but seemed finally to steady himself as it were upon
Godins glance Its a strange thing how the directness and intense
earnestness of a strong man will pull the vacillation of a weak one into
line with it even as great ships draw lesser ones into their wakes The
excited audience hung breathlessly upon Latours utterance At last they
were to know how this miracle of crime had been performed Every auditor
leaned forward in his seat and those who were a trifle dull of hearing
placed their hands to their ears fearful lest some syllable of the
riddles solution should escape them M Latour remained dumb The Judge
regarded him sternly and said

Answer the question How did you enter the Darrow parlour

A II didI did not enter it

Again a halfsuppressed exclamation of surprise traversed the room

Q If you did not enter the room how did you plunge the hypodermic
syringe into your victims neck

It seemed for a moment as if the witness would utterly collapse but he
pulled himself together as with a mighty effort and fairly took our
breath away with his astounding answer

A II did not strike Mr Darrow with the syringe

The audience literally gasped in openmouthed amazement while the Court
turned fiercely upon Latour and said

What do you mean by first telling us you killed Mr Darrow by injecting
poison into his circulation from a specially prepared hypodermic
syringe and then telling us that you did not strike him with this
syringe What do you mean sir Answer me

A sudden change came over M Latour All his timidity seemed to vanish
in a moment as he drew himself up to his full height and faced the
Judge It seemed to me as if till now he had cherished a hope that he
might not be forced to give the details of his awful crime but that
he had at last concluded he would be obliged to disclose all the
particulars and had decided to manfully face the issue

Every eye was fixed upon him and every ear strained to its utmost as
he turned slowly toward the Judge and said with a calm dignity which
surprised us all

A Your Honour is in error I said that I made use of a specially
constructed hypodermic syringe I have not said that I struck Mr Darrow
with it There is therefore nothing contradictory in my statements

Again the prisoner had scored and again the audience exchanged
approving glances which plainly said Hes clever enough for them all

Then the Court continued the examination

Q Were you upon the Darrow estate when Mr Darrow met his death

A Yes your Honour

Q Where

A Just outside the eastern parlourwindow your Honour

Q Did you strike the blow which caused Mr Darrows death

A No your Honour

Q What Have you not said you are responsible for his murder

A Yes your Honour

Q Ah I see You had some other person for an accomplice

A No your Honour

Q Look here sir Do you propose to tell us anything of your own
accord or must we drag it out of you piecemeal

A No power can make me speak if I do not elect to and I only elect to
answer questions Commission for contempt will hardly discipline a man
in my position and may lead me to hold my peace entirely

The Court turned away with an expression of disgust and engaged Jenkins
and Maitland in a whispered conversation The prisoner had again scored
There is enough of the bully in many judges to cause the public to
secretly rejoice when they are worsted It was plain to be seen that the
audience was pleased with Latours defiance

Maitland now resumed the examination with his accustomed ease One would
have thought he was addressing a church sociableif he judged by his
manner

Q You have testified to being responsible for the death of John Darrow
The instrument with which he was killed was directly or indirectly your
handiwork yet you did not strike the blow and you have said you had no
other person for an accomplice Am I substantially correct in all this

A You are quite correct

Q Very good Did John Darrows death result from a poisoned wound made
by the instrument you have described

A It did

This reply seemed to nonplus us all with the exception of Maitland and
Godin These two seemed proof against all surprises The rest of us
looked helplessly each at his neighbour as if to say What next and
we all feltat least I did and the others certainly looked itas if
the solution of the enigma were farther away than ever

Maitland proceeded in the same methodical strain

Q A blow was given yet neither you nor any person acting as your
accomplice gave it Did Mr Darrow himself give the blow

A No sir

Q I thought not Did any person give it

A No sir

The audience drew a deep inspiration as if with one accord They had
ceased to reason Again and again had we been brought as we all felt
sure within a single syllable of the truth only to find ourselves at
the next word more mystified than ever It would hardly have surprised
us more if the prisoner had informed us that Mr Darrow still lived The
excitement was so intense that thought was impossible so we could only
listen with bated breath for someone else to solve the thing for our
beleaguered and discouraged minds After a word with his colleague
Maitland resumed

Q A blow was given yet no person gave it Was it given by anything
which is alive

A It was not

You could have heard a pin drop so silent was the room during the pause
which preceded Maitlands next question

Q Did you arrange some inanimate object or objects outside the eastern
window or elsewhere on the Darrow estate so that it or they might
wound Mr Darrow

A Nono inanimate object other than the hypodermic syringe already
referred to

Q To my question A blow was given yet no person gave it Was it
given by anything which is alive you have answered It was not Let
me now ask Was it given by anything which was at that time alive

A It was

There was a stir all over the courtroom Here at last was a suggestive
admission The examination was approaching a crisis

Q And you have said it was not a person Was it not an animal

A It was

An animal we all ejaculated with the unanimity of a Greek chorus
So audible were the exclamations of incredulity which arose from the
spellbound audience that the criers gavel had to be brought into
requisition before Maitland could proceed

Q Did you train a little Capucin monkey to strike this blow

A I did

A great sigh the result of suddenly relieved tension liberally
interlarded with unconscious exclamations swept over the courtroom and
would not be gavelled into silence until it had duly spent itself

Even the Judge so far forgot his dignity as to give vent to a
halfstifled exclamation

Maitland proceeded

Q In order that this monkey might not attack the wrong man after you
had armed him you taught him to obey certain signals given by little
twitches upon the cord by which you held him A certain signal was to
creep stealthily forward another to strike and still another to crawl
quickly back with the weapon When circumstances seemed most favourable
to the success of your designsthat is when Miss Darrows voice and
the piano prevented any slight sound from attracting attentionyou
gently dropped the monkey in at the window and signalled him what to do
When Mr Darrow sprang to his feet you recalled the monkey and hastened
away Is not this a fairly correct description of what occurred

A It is true to the letter

Q And subsequently you killed the monkey lest he should betray you
by exhibiting his little tricks at an inopportune moment in a way to
compromise you Is it not so

A It is I killed him though he was my daughters pet

We were stricken aghast at Maitlands sudden grasp of the case Even
Godin was surprised What could it all mean Had Maitland known the
facts all along Had he simply been playing with the witness for reasons
which we could not divine M Godins face was a study He ceased boring
holes in Latour with his eyes and turned those wonderful orbs full upon
Maitland in whom they seemed to sink to the depths of his very soul
Clearly M Godin was surprised at this exhibition of Maitlands power

Browne who throughout the trial had glared at Maitland with an
unfriendliness which must have been apparent to everyone now lowered
blacker than ever it seemed to me I wondered what could have occurred
to still further displease him and finally concluded it must either be
some transient thought which had come uncalled into his mind or else
a feeling of envy at his rivals prominence in the case and the
deservedly good reputation he was making His general illfeeling I of
course charged to jealousy for I could not but note his uncontrollable
admiration for Gwen I fully believed he would have given his own
lifeor anyone elses for that matterto possess her and I decided to
speak a word of warning to George After a short whispered consultation
with Jenkins and the prosecuting attorney Maitland turned to the
prisoner and said

That will do M Latour may leave the stand

It seemed to the spectators that the affair was now entirely cleared
up and they accordingly settled themselves comfortably for the formal
denouement They were therefore much taken aback when Maitland
continued addressing the jury

The evidence against the prisoner would indeed seem overwhelming
even had we not his confession Apart from this confession we have
no incriminating evidence save such as has been furnished by the
governments chief witness M Godin As it is through this gentlemans
efforts that Latour was brought within reach of justice it is but
natural that much should be clear to him which may be puzzling to
those who have not made so close a study of the case I think he will
enlighten us upon a few points M Godin will please take the stand

At this there was much whispering in the courtroom Maitlands course
seemed decidedly anomalous Everyone wondered why he should be at such
pains to prove that which had been already admitted and which moreover
since he was representing Latour it would seem he would most naturally
wish to disprove M Godin however took the stand and Maitland
proceeded to examine him in a way which only added amazement to wonder

Q How long have you been at work on this case

A Ever since the murder

Q When did you first visit M Latours rooms

A Do you mean to enter them

Q Yes

A I did not enter his rooms until the day he was arrested I went to
other rooms of the same tenementhouse on previous occasions

Q Have you reason to believe M Latour ever saw you prior to the day of
his arrest

A No I am sure he did not I was especially careful to keep out of his
way

Q You are certain that on the several occasions when you say you
entered his rooms you were not observed by him while there

A I did not say I entered his rooms on several occasions

Q What did you say

A I said I never was in his rooms but once and that was upon the day
of his arrest

Q I understand Were you not assisted in your search for Mr Darrows
murderer by certain library books which you discovered M Latour had
been reading

A II dont quite understand

Q M Latour obtained some books from the Public Library for hall use
giving his name asas

A Weltz Yes they did assist me There were some also taken under the
name of Rizzi

Q Exactly Those are the names I think How was your attention called
to these books

A I met Latour at the library by accident and he at once struck me as
a man anxious to avoid observation This made it my business to watch
him I saw that he signed his name as Weltz on the slips The next day
I saw him there again and this time he signed the slips Rizzi This
was long before the murder and I was not at work upon any case into
which I could fit this Weltz or Rizzi I was convinced in my own
mind however that he was guilty of some crime and so put him down in
my memory for future reference During my work upon this present case
this incident recurred to me and I followed up the suggestion as one
which might possibly throw some light upon the subject

Q Did you peruse the books M Latour borrowed under the names of Weltz
and Rizzi

A I did not

Q Did you not look at any of them

A No It did not occur to me to examine their names

Q You probably noticed that there were several of them Among the pile
was one by Alexander Wynter Blyth entitled Poisons Their Effects and
Detection Did you notice that

A No I did not notice any of them

Q But after you became suspicious of M Latour did you not then look
up the slips find this work and read it

A No I have never seen the book in my life and did not even know such
a work existed

Q Oh Then the perusal of the books had no part in the tracking of M
Latour

A None whatever

Q Do you ever play cards

A Yes sometimes to pass the time

Q Do you play for money

A Sometimes for a small stakejust enough to make it interesting

Q Are you familiar with the house in which Mr Darrow was murdered

A I have only such knowledge of it as I acquired at the examination
immediately after the murder You will remember I entered but the one
room

Q And the grounds about the house Surely you examined them

A On the contrary I did not

Q Did you not even examine the eastern side of the house

A I did not I have never been within the gate save on the night in
question and then only to traverse the front walk to and from the house
in company with Messieurs Osborne and Allen I was convinced that the
solution of the problem was to be found within the room in which the
murder was committed and that my notes taken the night of the tragedy
contained all the data I could hope to get

Q Was not this rather a singular assumption

A For many doubtless it would be but I have my own methods and I
think I may say they have been measurably successful in most cases
This last was said with a goodnatured smile and a modest dignity that
completely won the audience

At this point Maitland dismissed M Godin and the court adjourned
for the day That night M Godin made his first call upon Gwen Their
interview was private and Gwen had nothing to say about it further
than that her caller had not hesitated to inform her that he was aware
a reward had been offered and that he considered he had earned it
Maitland questioned her as to what he had claimed as his due but Gwen
with her face alternately flushed and ashen begged to be permitted to
keep silence

This attitude was of course not without its significance to Maitland
and it was easy to see that M Godins visit had much displeased him
But he was not the only one who was displeased that night I regret
that my promise of utter candour compels me to bear witness to my own
foolishness for when Maitland found it necessary to take Jeannette
into the back parlour and to remain there alone with her in earnest
conversation one hour and twelve minutesI happened to notice the exact
timeit seemed to me he was getting unpleasantly confidential and it
nettled me You may fancy that I was jealous but it was most likely
only pique or at the worst envy I was provoked at the nonchalant
ease with which this fellow did offhand a thing I had been trying to
work myself up to for several days and had finally abandoned from sheer
lack of courage Why couldnt I carelessly say to her Miss Jeannette
a word with you if you please and then take her into the parlour and
talk a whole history Oh it was envy thats what it was And then
the change in Jeannette If he had not been making love to herwell I
have often wondered since if it were all envy after all

The next morning M Latours trial was resumed and Maitland again put
M Godin upon the stand The object of this did not appear at the time
though I think the Judge fully understood it Maitlands first act was
to show the Judge and Jury a glass negative and a letter which he asked
them to examine carefully as he held the articles before them He then
passed the negative to M Godin saying

Please take this by the lower corner between your thumb and
forefinger so that you may be sure not to touch the sight of the
picture hold it to the light and tell me if you recognise the face
M Godin did as directed and replied without hesitancy It is a picture
of M Latour Good rejoined Maitland taking back the negative and
passing him the letter now tell me if you recognise that signature
M Godin looked sharply at the letter holding it open between the thumb
and forefinger of each hand and read the signature Carl Cazenove I
should say that was M Latours hand

Good again replied Maitland reaching for the paper and appearing
somewhat disconcerted as he glanced at it You have smutched the
signaturehowever it doesnt matter and he exhibited the paper to
the Judge and Jury The negative must have been oilyyes thats where
it came from and he quietly examined it with a magnifying glass to
the wonderment of us all That is all M Godin thank you

As the celebrated detective left the stand we were all doing our best
to fathom what possible bearing all this could have upon Latours
confession M Godin for once seemed equally at a loss to comprehend
the trend of affairs if I may judge by the deep furrows which gathered
between his eyes

Maitland then proceeded to address the Court and to sum up his case the
gist of which I shall give you as nearly as possible in his own words
omitting only such portions as were purely formal uninteresting or
unnecessarily verbose

Your Honour and Gentlemen of the Jury John Darrow was murdered and the
prisoner M Gustave Latour has confessed that he did the deed When
a man denies the commission of a crime we do not feel bound to consider
his testimony of any particular value but when on the other hand
a prisoner accused of so heinous a crime as murder responds to the
indictment I am guilty we instinctively feel impelled to believe
his testimony Why is this Why do we doubt his word when he asserts his
innocence and accept it when he acknowledges his guilt I will tell
you It is all a question of motive Could we see as cogent a motive for
asseverating his guilt as we find for his insisting upon his innocence
we should lend as much credence to the one as to the other I propose to
show that M Latour has what seems to him the strongest of motives for
confessing to the murder of John Darrow If I am able to do this to
your satisfaction I shall practically have thrown M Latours entire
testimony out of court and nothing of importance will then remain but
the evidence of the governments witness M Godin

A great wave of excitement swept over the room at these remarks What
each said to himself is it possible that this lawyer will try to prove
that Latour despite his circumstantial confession did not commit the
murder after all We did not dare let such a thought take hold of us
yet could not see what else could explain Maitlands remarks Is it any
wonder therefore that we all waited breathlessly for him to continue
M Godins face was dark and lowering It was evident he did not propose
to have his skill as a detectiveand with it the Darrow rewardset
aside without a struggleat least so it seemed to me The room was as
quiet as the grave when Maitland continued

I shall show you that M Godins testimony is utterly unreliable and
moreover that it is intentionally so

This was a direct accusation and at it M Godins face became of ashen
pallor I felt that he was striving to control his anger and saw the
effort that it cost him as he fastened Maitland with a stilettolike
look that was anything but reassuring George did not appear to notice
it and continued easily

I shall prove to you beyond a doubt that in the actual murder of John
Darrow only one person was concernedby which I mean that only one
person was outside the east window when he met his death I shall also
show that M Latour was not and could not by any possibility have been
that person At this juncture Browne arose and walked toward the door
He was very pale and looked anything but well I thought he was going to
leave but he reseated himself at the back of the room near the door
I shall convince you that M Latours description of the way the murder
was committed is false

All eyes were turned toward Latour but he made no sign either of
affirmation or dissent With his eyes closed and his hands falling
listlessly in front of him he sat in a halfcollapsed condition like
one in a stupor M Godin shifted uneasily in his chair as if he
could not remain silent much longer Maitland proceeded with calm
deliberation

Mr Clinton Browne

But he did not finish the sentence At the name Mr Clinton Browne he
was interrupted by a sudden commotion at the rear of the room followed
by a heavy fall which shook the whole apartment We all turned and
looked toward the door Several men had gathered about someone lying
upon the floor and one of them was throwing water in the face of the
prostrate man Presently he revived a little and they bore him out into
the cooler air of the corridor It was Clinton Browne The great tension
of the trial his own strong emotions and the closeness of the room had
doubtless been too much for him I could not but marvel at it however
Here were delicate women with apparently little or no staying power and
yet this athlete with the form of a Mars and the fibre of a Hercules
must be the first to succumb Verily even physicians are subject to
surprises

When quiet had been fully restored Maitland continued

I was about to say when the interruption occurred that Mr Clinton
Browne and Mr Charles Herne would both testify to the fact that a very
sensible time elapsed between the delivery of the blow and the death
of the victim You will see therefore that I shall prove to your
satisfaction that Mr Darrows death did not result from prussic acid
as stated by the prisoner I shall show you that a chemical analysis of
the wound made in my laboratory shortly after the murder gave none of
the wellknown prussicacid reactions I shall prove to you that John
Darrow sprang to his feet after receiving the blow which caused his
death That he clutched at his throat and that after an effort
consuming several seconds he spoke disjointedly I shall convince you
that if he had been poisoned in the manner described he would have been
dead before he could have so much as raised his hand to his throat We
have been very particular to make sure the exact nature of the poison
which it is claimed was used so there can be no possible doubt upon
this point I shall show you further that the little Capucin monkey
which M Latour says he killed is still alive and I will produce him
if necessary and will challenge M Latour or anyone else for that
matter to put him through the drill which it is claimed he has been
taught I shall inform you that since I claim the monkey had no part in
Mr Darrows death I could not during my examination of the prisoner
have been stating anything from knowledge when I spoke of the manner
in which he had trained the animal and gave details which M Latour
accepted as those of the murder My sole effort was to state a plausible
way in order to see if the prisoner would not adopt it as the actual
course pursued I also coupled with this the killing of the monkey
though I knew the animal was still alive that I might see if M
Latour would follow my lead in this also You have seen that he did so
that he indorsed my guesses where they were purely guesses and that he
also accepted the one statement I knew to be false I shall therefore
ask you to consider about what the chances are that a series of guesses
like those which I made would represent the exact facts as M Latour has
claimed while at the same time you do not lose sight of the undeniable
fact that upon the only detail regarding which I had positive
information M Latour bore false testimony

Here Maitland whispered to Jenkins who in turn spoke to the sheriff
or some other officer of the court I would have given a good deal just
then to have been able to translate M Godins thoughts His face was a
study Maitland immediately resumed

It has been positively stated by M Latour that he gambled with Mr
Darrow on Decatur Street between the 1st and 15th day of March This
is false In the first place it can be shown that while Mr Darrow
occasionally played cards at his own home he never gambled uniformly
refusing to play for even the smallest stake Furthermore Mr Darrows
physician will testify that Mr Darrow was confined to his bed from the
25th day of February to the 18th day of March and that he visited him
during that time at least once and oftener twice every day

Again M Latour asserts that he never saw M Godin till the day of
his arrest and M Godin asserts that he never entered M Latours rooms
until that day I have a photograph and here a phonographic record The
picture shows M Latours rooms with that gentleman and M Godin sitting
at a table and evidently engaged in earnest conversation This cylinder
is a record of a very interesting portion of that conversationM Godin
will please not leave the room

This last was said as M Godin started toward the door The officer to
whom Jenkins had recently spoken laid his hand upon the detective and
detained him We may need M Godin Maitland continued to explain
things to us

I invite your attention to the fact that M Godin has testified that he
was assisted in his search for Mr Darrows murderer by certain library
slips which he saw M Latour make out in two different names He has
also testified that he did not know even the names of any of the books
procured on these slips and that one of them entitled Poisons Their
Effects and Detection he not only never read but never even heard of
I shall show you that all of these books were procured with M Godins
knowledge and that most of them were read by him I shall prove to you
beyond a doubt that he has not only heard of this particular work on
poisons but that he has read it and placed his unmistakable signature
on page 469 thereof beside the identical paragraph which suggested to
Mr Darrows murderer the manner of his assassination M Godin started
as if he had been stabbed but quickly regained his selfcontrol as
Maitland continued Here is the volume in question You will please
note the thumbmark in the margin of page 469 There is but one thumb in
the world that could have made that mark and that is the thumb you have
seen register itself upon this letter It is also the thumb that made
this paint smutch upon this slip of glass

All eyes were turned upon M Godin He was very pale yet his jaw
was firmly set and something akin to a defiant smile played about his
handsome mouth To say that the audience was amazed is to convey no
adequate idea of their real condition We felt prepared for anything
I almost feared lest some sudden turn in the case might cast suspicion
upon myself or even Maitland Without apparently noticing M Godins
discomfiture George continued

M Godin has testified that he sometimes plays cards but only for a
small stakejust enough he says to make it interesting I shall show
you that he is a professional gambler as well as a detective

The morning after the murder was committed I made a most careful
examination of the premises particularly of the grounds near the
eastern window As the result of my observations I informed Miss Darrow
that I had reason to believe that her father had been murdered by a
person who had some good motive for concealing his footprints and
who also had a halting gait The weight of this person I was able to
estimate at not far from one hundred and thirtyfive pounds and his
height as about five feet and five inches I also stated it as my
opinion that the person who did the deed had the habit of biting his
finger nails and a particular reason for sparing the nail of the little
finger and permitting it to grow to an abnormal length This was not
guesswork on my part for in the soft soil beneath the eastern window
I found a perfect impression of a closed hand Here is the cast of
that hand Look well at it Notice the wart upon the upper joint of the
thumb and the crook in the third finger where it has evidently been
broken M Godin says he never entered the yard of the Darrow estate
except on the night of the murder in company with Messrs Osborne and
Allen and that then he merely passed up and down the front walk on his
way to and from the house yet the paintmark on this slip of glass was
made by his thumb and the glass itself was cut by me from the eastern
window of the Darrow housethe window through which the murder was
committed This plaster cast was taken from an impression in the soil
beneath the same window on the morning after the murder The hand is
the hand of M Godin You will note that one of this gentlemans feet is
deformed and that he habitually halts in his walk

We all glanced at M Godin to verify these assertions but that
gentleman folded his arms in a way to conceal his hands and thrust his
feet out of sight beneath the chair in front of him while he smiled at
us with the utmost apparent good nature He would be game to the last
there was no doubt of that

Maitland recalled our attention by saying

Officer you will please arrest M Godin

An excited whisper was heard from every corner and many were the
halfaudible comments that were broken off by the imperative fall of the
criers gavel So tense had been the strain that it was some time before
complete order could be restored When it was again quiet Maitland
continued

Your Honour and Gentlemen of the Jury We will rest our case here
for today Tomorrow or rather on Monday we shall show the strange
influence which M Godin exercised over M Latour as well as M
Latours reasons for his confession We shall endeavour to make clear
to you how M Latour was actually led to believe he had murdered John
Darrow and how he was bribed to confess a crime committed by another
Of the hypnotic power of M Godin over M Latour I have indisputable
proof though we shall see that M Godin by no means relied wholly
upon this power We shall show you also that sufficient time elapsed
to enable M Godin by great skill and celerity to make away with the
evidences of his guilt in time to enable him to be present with Messrs
Osborne and Allen at the examination In short we shall unravel before
you a crime which for cleverness of conception and adroitness of
execution has never been equalled in the history of this community

Maitland having thus concluded his remarks by dropping into a courteous
plural in deference to Mr Jenkins the court adjourned until Monday
and I left Gwen in Maitlands charge while I hurried home fearful lest
I should not be the first to bring to Jeannette the glad news of her
fathers innocence for I had not the slightest doubt of Maitlands
ability to prove conclusively all he had undertaken

I need not describe to you my interview with Jeannette There are things
concerning it which even at this late day when their roseate hue glows
but dimly in the blue retrospect of the pastit would seem sacrilege
for me to mention to another Believe me I am perfectly aware of your
inquisitive nature and I know that this omission may nettle you Charge
it all up then to the perversity of a bachelor in the throes of his
first last and only love experience You must see that such
things cannot be conveyed to another with anything like their real
significance Were I to say I was carried beyond myself by her
protestations of gratitude until in a delirium of joy I seized her in
my arms and covered her with kisses do you for a moment fancy you
could appreciate my feelings Do you imagine that the little tingle
of sympathy which you might experience were I to say that instead of
pushing me from her I felt her clasp tighten about mewould tell you
anything of the great torrent of hot blood that deluged my heart as
she lay there in my arms quivering ecstatically at every kiss No a
thousand times no Therefore have I thought best to say nothing about
it Our love can keep its own secretsBut alas this was long ago
and as I sit here alone writing this to you I cannot but wonder with
a heavy sense of everpresent longing where on this great earth
Jeannettemy Jeannette I have learned to call heris now You see
a bachelors loveaffair is a serious thing and years cannot always
efface it But to return to the past

Jeannette I think was not more pleased than Gwen at the turn affairs
had taken Indeed so exuberant was Gwen in her quiet way that I
marvelled much at the change in her so much indeed that finally I
determined to question Alice about it

I can understand I said to her why Gwen on account of her sympathy
and love for Jeannette should be glad that M Latour is likely to be
acquitted I can also appreciate the distaste she may have felt at the
prospect of having to deal with M Godin under the terms of her fathers
will but even both of these considerations seem to me insufficient
to account for her present almost ecstatic condition There is an
immediateness to her joy which could hardly result from mere release
from a future disagreeable possibility How do you account for it
sis Alices answer was somewhat enigmatical and didnt give me the
information I sought Ned she replied Ill pay for the tickets to
the first circus that comes here just to see if you can find the trunks
on the elephants Do my best I couldnt make her enlighten me any
further for to every question she replied with a most provoking
laugh

Maitland called and spent most of the next day which was Sunday with
us and we all talked matters over He did not seem either to share or
understand Gwens exuberance of spirits albeit one could easily observe
that he had a measure of that satisfaction which always comes from
success More than once I saw him glance questioningly at Gwen with a
look which said plainly enough What is the meaning of this remarkable
change Why should it so matter to her whether M Latours or M Godins
death avenges her fathers murder When he left us at night I could see
he had not answered that question to his own satisfaction




CHAPTER III

 The Devil throws double sixes when he turns genius heliward

The next morning after the events last narrated I was utterly dumfounded
by an article which met my gaze the instant I took up my paper It was
several moments before I sufficiently recovered my faculties to read
it aloud to Gwen Alice and Jeannette all of whom had noticed my
excitement and were waiting with such patience as they could command
I read the following article through from beginning to end without pause
or comment


 M Godin Anticipates the LawThe Real Murderer of John Darrow
 Writes His Confession and Then Suicides in His CellContrived
 to Mix His Own Poison Under the Very Nose of His Jailer
 The Dorchester Mystery Solved at LastFull Description of the
 Life of One of the Cleverest Criminals of the Century

At 430 this morning M Godin was found dead in his cell No 26 at
Charles Street Jail The manner of his death might still be a mystery
had he not left a written confession of his crime and the summary manner
of his taking off This was written yesterday afternoon and evening
M Godin being permitted to have a light on the ground that he had
important legal documents to prepare for use on the morrow We give
below the confession in full

I am beaten at a game in which I did my own shuffling I never believe
in trying to bluff a full hand Had I had but ordinary detectives
with whom to deal I make bold to say I should have come off rich and
triumphant I had no means of knowing that I was to play with a chemist
who would use against me the latest scientific implements of criminal
warfare It is therefore to the extraordinary means used for my
detection that I impute my defeat rather than to any bungling of my
own This is a grim consolation but it is still a consolation for I
have always prided myself upon being an artist in my line As I propose
to put myself beyond the reach of further crossexamination I take this
opportunity to make a last statement of such things as I care to have
known After this is finished I shall sup on acetate of lead and bid
goodnight to the expectant public

Lest some may marvel how I came by this poison and even lay suspicions
upon my jailers let me explain that there is a small piece of lead
waterpipe crossing the west angle of my room This being Sunday I was
permitted to have beans and brown bread for breakfast I asked for a
little vinegar for my beans and a small cruet was brought to me I had
no difficulty in secreting a considerable quantity of the vinegar in
order that I might when occasion served apply it to the lead pipe
This I have done and have now by me enough acetate of lead to kill a
dozen men This form of death will not be particularly pleasant I am
aware but I prefer it to its only alternative So much for that

I was horn in Marseilles and my right name is Jean Fouchet My father
intended me for the priesthood and gave me a good college education in
Paris His hopes however were destined to disappointment In college I
formed the habit of gambling and a year after my graduation found me
at Monte Carlo While there I quarrelled with a gambling accomplice and
ended by killing him This made my stay in France dangerous for me
and I took the first opportunity which presented itself to embark for
America

Familiarity with criminals had made me familiar with crime and I added
the occupation of detective to my profession of gambling These two
avocations had now become my sole means of support and I plied my
trades in New York Boston and Philadelphia for several years during
which time I became a naturalised citizen of the United States

When the Cuban rebellion broke out I could not restrain my longing for
adventure and joined a filibustering expedition sailing from New York
I did this from no love I bore the Cuban cause but merely for the
excitement it promised While handling a heavy shot during my first
engagement I accidentally dropped it upon my left foot crushing that
member so badly that it has never regained its shape This deformity has
rendered it impossible for me to conceal my identity Three months after
this accident I was taken prisoner by the Spanish and shipped to Spain
as a political malefactor A farce of a trial was granted to me not
to see whether or not I was guilty but simply to determine between the
dungeon and the garrote It would have been far better for me had I been
sentenced to the latter instead of the former

As a political offender I was doomed to imprisonment at Ceuta an old
Moorish seaport town in Morocco opposite Gibraltar and upon the side of
the ancient mountain Abyla This mountain forms one of the Pillars
of Hercules the Rock of Gibraltar being the other It is almost
impregnable and is used by Spain as Siberia is used by Russia only it
is far far more horrible The town was built by the Moors in 945 and
nowhere else on earth are there to be found an equal number of devices
for the torture of human beings If anyone thinks the horrors of the
Inquisition are no longer perpetrated let him get sent to Ceuta I have
good cause to believe that the Inquisition itself is far from dead in
Spain Alas for the person who is sent to Ceuta The town is small
and to guard against possible attack the Moors constructed a chain of
fortresses around it It is in the black cellars of these disintegrating
fortresses that the dungeons are located They are in tiers to the depth
of fifty or sixty feet and are hewn out of the solid rock They are
reached through narrow openings in the stone floors of the fortresses
and when one of these horrible holes is opened the foul odor of filth
and decomposition is utterly overpowering Some of these dungeons
contain as many as thirty or forty men I was placed in a cell reserved
for solitary confinement I have never been a man who regarded life
seriously or feared to risk it upon sufficient occasion but my heart
froze within me when the horror of my situation was revealed to me A
stone box perhaps eight feet squareas I lay upon the floor I could
touch its opposite sides with my hands and feethad been prepared for
my entrance by cutting a slit in one of its walls just large enough for
the passage of my body Through this narrow opening I was dropped into
the total darkness within A blacksmith followed and welded my fetters
for locks and keys are never used A chain having a heavy weight pendant
from it was riveted to my ankle and an iron band was similarly fastened
to my waist This band was fastened by a chain to an iron ring deeply
sunk in the solid rock When these horrible preparations were completed
the blacksmith left me and a mason bricked up the slit through which
I had entered leaving only a handbreadth of space for air and the
thrusting through of such scraps of food as were to be allowed me
Language is powerless to describe the feelings of a man in such a
position He realises that his only hope is in diseasedisease bred of
the darkness the dampness the starvation and the horrible filth
He says to himself How long O God how longFor hours I remained
prone and inerthow long I do not know night and day are all one in
the dungeons of Ceuta Then I began to think Could I escape I felt
that all power of thought all cleverness would soon desert me and I
said to myself If anything is to be done it must be done at once I
knew not then what longdrawn horrors a mortal could endure Whenever
I attempted to walk the iron mass fastened to my leg would bring me up
short often in my early forgetfulness of it throwing me prone upon
my face After a little I learned to move with a halting gait striding
out with the free limb and pausing to pull my burden after me with the
other This habit learned in the squalor and darkness of the dungeon
hells of Ceuta I have never been able to unlearn

It was many days before I could see how anything short of a miracle
could enable me to escape I tried to calmly reason it all out and
every time came to the same horrible conclusion viz I must rot there
unless help came to me from without This seemed impossible and all the
horrors of a lingering death stared me in the face Every two or three
days one of the jailers would come to the slit in the masonry and leave
there a dish of water and a few crusts of bread I tried on one occasion
to speak with him but he only laughed in my face and turned away
Finally I hit upon a plan which seemed to offer the only possible means
of escape In my college days I was well acquainted with M Charcot and
even assisted in some of his earlier hypnotic experiments The subject
interested me and I followed it closely till I became something of
an adept myself There were in those days but few people I could not
mesmerise provided sufficient opportunity were allowed me for hypnotic
suggestion I determined to see if any of this old power still remained
with me and if so to strive to render my jailer subservient to my
will But how should I keep him within earshot long enough to work upon
him Clearly all appeals to pity were useless I must excite his greed
nothing else would reach him This was not an easy thing to do without
a sou in my possession yet I did it When I heard his step I crawled
to the opening in the wall and mumbled in a crazy sort of a way about a
hidden treasure At the word treasure I saw him pause and listen but
I pretended not to be aware of his presence and rambled on in a loose
disjointed fashion about piracies committed by me and the great amount
of booty I had secreted My plan worked perfectly The jailer came to
the aperture in the wall and called me to him Muttering incoherently
I obeyed He asked me what offence brought me there and I with a good
deal of intentional misunderstanding told him I was a pirate and a
smuggler He asked me where the treasure I had been talking about
was hidden My replyI remember the exact words in which I couched
itmade him mine completely I said We buried it near Fez
Treasure I dont know anything about any treasure

To all the many questions he then asked me I returned only incoherent
replies but I was careful to be again raving about buried riches upon
the next visit In this way I kept him by me long enough to influence
him and in less than a month he was completely subject to my will
I tested my power over him in divers ways Any delicacy I wished I
compelled him to bring me In this way I was enabled to regain a portion
of my lost strength When I concluded the time had come for me to make
good my escape I caused him to come to my cell at midnight and remove
the bricks from the slit while I put on the disguise he had brought
me Once out of my stone tomb we carefully walled it up again and then
departed to find my imaginary hidden treasure We made our way without
trouble to Algiers for my companion had money and sailed thence via
Gibraltar for England During the trip my companion jumped overboard and
was drowned in the Bay of Biscay Thus I was completely freed from Ceuta
and its terrible pesthole

From England I sailed to New York reaching America penniless and in
ill health Things not going to my liking in New York I came to Boston
and took up my old callings of gambler and detective It was at this
time that I saw John Darrows curious notice in the newspaper offering
in the event of his murder a most liberal reward to anyone who would
bring the assassin to justice

Mon Dieu How I needed money I would have bartered my soul for a tithe
of that amount It was the old old story only new in Eden Ah but how
I loved her She must have money money always money That was ever her
cry When I could not supply it she sought it of others and this drove
me mad If I said to myself I could only get this reward This was
something really worth working for and if I could but get it she
should be mine only I at once set to work upon the problem

It was not an easy thing to solve I might be able to hire a man to do
the deed for me but he would hardly be willing to hang for it without
disclosing my part in the transaction It was at this time that I first
met M Latour on Decatur Street He at once impressed me as being just
the man I wanted and I began to gradually subdue his will In this
circumstances greatly aided me When I found him he was in very poor
health and without any means of sustenance His daughter was able to
earn a little but not nearly enough to keep the wolf from the door Add
to this that he had a cancer which several physicians had assured him
would prove fatal within a year that he was afflicted with an almost
insane fear that his daughter would come to want after his death and
you have before you the conditions which determined my course My first
thought was to influence him to do the deed himself but recalling the
researches of M Charcot in these matters I came to the conclusion
that such a course would be almost certain to lead to detection since
a hypnotic subject can only be depended upon so long as the conditions
under which he acts are precisely those which have been suggested to
him Any unforeseen variations in these conditions and he fails to act
exposes everything and the whole carefully planned structure falls to
the ground When therefore the time came which I had set for the deed
I found it possible to drug M Latour abduct him from his home and
to keep him confined and unconscious until I had killed Mr Darrow in
a manner I will describe in due course As soon as I had committed the
murder and established what I fondly believed would be a perfect alibi
in my attendance at the examination I secretly conveyed the
still unconscious M Latour to his rooms and awaited his return to
consciousness I then asked him how he came in such a state and what
he was doing in Dorchester He was of course ignorant of everything
Little by little I worked upon him till he came to believe himself
guilty of John Darrows murder

I had availed myself of his interest in the subject of cancer to get
him to the library It is one of my maxims never to take an avoidable
risk for which reason I made Latour apply for the books I wanted
as well as for the medical works he desired to peruse As he was
ambidextrous I suggested the use of the two names Weltz and Rizzi the
former to be written with his right and the latter with his left hand
I was actuated in all this by two motives First I was manufacturing
evidence which might stand me in good stead later as well as minimising
somewhat my own risk in getting the information I needed and secondly
I was getting Latour into a good atmosphere for my hypnotic influence
Not a word of all these matters did he relate to his daughter whom he
loves with a devotion I have never seen equalled Indeed it was this
very affection that made my plan feasible When I had convinced him he
was a murderer I showed him Mr Darrows curious advertisement offering
a reward should he be assassinated to anyone bringing about the
conviction of his assailant

In a year I said to him you will die of cancer if your crime
be not previously discovered and punished Your daughter will then
be penniless How much better for you to permit me in a few months
to accuse you of the murder You then confess I claim and secure
the reward and secretly divide with you you are sentenced but as
considerable time will transpire between this and the date set for your
execution you in the meantime will die of cancer leaving Jeannette
well provided for

I think my influence over him would have been sufficient to have
compelled him to all this could he have reasoned out no benefit
accruing to himself or daughter by such a course but with circumstances
thus in my favour my task was an easy one The public knows all it need
know of what occurred after this This man Maitland was in the next
room to Latours overheard our conversation and even phonographed our
words and photographed our positions It has always been a matter of
pride with me to gracefully acknowledge that three aces are not so good
as a full house therefore I confess myself beaten though not subdued

I consider this the very best tribute I can pay to the genius of the
man who has undone me I take my punishment however into my own hands

In my haste to have done with all this and to start on my long and
chartless journey I had wellnigh forgotten to tell just how I killed
Mr Darrow No hypodermic syringe had anything to do with it The while
plan came to me while reading that fatal page upon which I left my
telltale thumbsignature in my search for some feasible plan of
making away with my victim I need not go into particulars for I know
perfectly well that this Maitland knows to a nicety how the thing was
done The Daboia Russellii or Russells viper is one of the best known
and most deadly of Indian vipers I procured one of these reptiles at
the cost of great delay and some slight risk That is the whole story
On the night of the murder I took the viper in a box and went down to
the waterfront near the Darrow estate Here I cut a small pole from a
clump of alders made a split in one end of it and thrust it over the
tail of the viper It pinched him severely and held him fast despite his
angry struggles to free himself and to attack anything within his reach
All that remained to be done was to thrust this through the window into
the darkened room and to bring the viper within reach of Mr Darrow
This I did being careful to crouch so as not to obstruct the light of
the window When I heard my victims outcry I withdrew the pole and
with it of course the viper and made good my escape That the reptile
bit Mr Darrow under the chin while his back was toward the window was
mere chance though I regarded it as a very lucky occurrence since it
seemed to render the suicide theory at first inevitable

I had had some fear lest the hissing of the viper might have been
heard for which reason I hazarded the only question I asked at the
examination and was completely reassured by its answer I should
perhaps state that my purpose in keeping in the background at this
examination was my desire to avoid attracting attention to my deformed
foot and my halting gait This latter I had taken pains to conceal at my
entrance but I knew that the first step I took in forgetfulness would
expose my halting habit I had no fear of either Osborne or Allen but
there was something about this Maitland that bade me at once be on my
guard and as I have said before I never take an avoidable risk
For this reason I sat at once in the darkest corner I could find and
remained there throughout the examination I thought it extremely
unlikely though possible that an attempt might be made to track the
assassin with dogs yet since that is precisely the first thing I
myself would have done I decided that the risk was worth avoiding I
accordingly set the boat adrift to indicate an escape by water and then
waded along the beach for half a mile or so carrying the pole boards
etc with me As I kept where the water was at least six inches deep I
knew no dog could follow my trail At the point where I left the water
I sat down upon a rock and put on my stockings and shoes thoroughly
saturating them at the same time with turpentine and pouring the
remainder of the bottle upon the rock where I had sat As I had known
prisoners escaped from Libby Prison to pass in this way undetected
within twenty feet of bloodhounds upon their trail I felt that my
tracks had been well covered and made all possible haste to get ready
to attend the examination with the special detail

And now I have finished Before this meets any other eye than mine
I shall be deadbeyond the punishment of this world and awaiting
the punishment of the next Lest some may fancy I do not believe
thisthinking that if I did I could not so have actedlet me
say there is no moral restraining power in fear Fear is essentially
selfish and selfishness is at the bottom of all crimes my own among
the rest I leave behind me none who will mourn me and have but one
satisfaction viz the knowledge that I shall be regarded as an
artist in crime I take this occasion to bid the public an adieu not
altogether I confess unmixed with regrets I am now on that eminence
called Life in a few minutes I shall have jumped off into the
darkness and thenall is mystery

When I had finished reading this article we all remained silent for a
long time Gwen was the first to speak and then only to say slowly as
if thinking aloud And so it is all over




CHAPTER IV


 It often happens that two souls who love are like the parts of
 a Mexican gemelring the more difficult to intertwine the better
 they fit each other

You may be assured that after reading M Godins confession we looked
forward to seeing Maitland with a good deal of interest We knew this
new turn of affairs would cause him to call at once so we all strove to
possess our souls in patience while we awaited his coming In less than
half an hour he was with us The news of your success has preceded
you said Gwen as soon as he was seated I wish to be the first to
offer you my congratulations You have done for me what none other
could have done and I owe you a debt of gratitude I can never repay The
thought that I was unable to carry out my fathers wishesthat I could
do nothing to free his name from the reproaches which had been cast upon
it was crushing my heart like a leaden weight You have removed this
burden and believe me words fail to express the gratitude I feel I
shall beg of you to permit me to pay you the sum my father mentioned and
toto She hesitated and Maitland did not permit her to finish her
sentence

You must pardon me Miss Darrow he replied but I can accept no
further payment for the little I have done It has been a pleasure to
do it and the knowledge that you are now released from the disagreeable
possibilities of your fathers will is more than sufficient
remuneration If you still feel that you owe me anything perhaps you
will be willing to grant me a favour

There is nothing she said earnestly within my power to grant for
which you shall ask in vain

Let me beg of you then he replied never again to seek to repay me
for any services you may fancy I have rendered There is nothing you
could bestow upon me which I would accept She gave him a quick
searching glance and I noticed a look of pain upon her face but
Maitland gave it no heed for indeed he seemed to have much ado either
to know what he wanted to say or knowing it to say it

And now he continued I must no longer presume to order your
actions You have considered my wishes so conscientiously have kept
your covenant so absolutely that what promised to be a disagreeable
responsibility has become a pleasure which I find myself loth to
discontinue All power leads to tyranny Man cannot be trusted with it
Its exercise becomes a consuming passion and he abuses it The story
is the same whether nations or individuals be considered I myself you
see am a case in point I thank you for the patience you have shown and
the pains you have taken to make everything easy and pleasant for me
and now I must be going as I have yet much to do in this matter It
may be a long time he said extending his hand to her before we meet
again We have travelled the same path but he paused as if unable to
proceed and a deadly pallor overspread his face as he let fall both her
hand and his own He made a heroic effort to proceed

II shall missveryvery much misspray pardon meII believe Im
illa little faint IdId better get out into the airI shallshall
misspardonIIm not quite myselfgoodbye goodbye and he
staggered unsteadily half blindly to the door and out into the street
without another word He certainly did look ill

Gwens face was a study In it surprise fear pain and dismay each
struggled for predominance She tried to retain her selfcontrol while
I was present but it was all in vain A moment later she threw herself
upon the sofa and burying her face in the cushions wept long and
bitterly I stole quietly away and sent Alice to her and after a time
she regained her selfcontrol if not her usual interest in affairs

As day after day passed however and Maitland neglected to call
transacting such business as he had through me the shadow on Gwens
face deepened and the elasticity of manner whereof she had given such
promise at Maitlands last visit totally deserted her giving place to
a dreamy faraway stolidity of disposition which I knew full well
boded no good I stood this sort of thing as long as I could and then I
determined to call on Maitland and give him a piece of my mind

I did call but when I saw him all my belligerent resolutions vanished
He was sitting at his table trying to work out some complicated problem
and he was utterly unfitted for a single minutes consecutive thought
I had not seen him for more than two weeks and during that time he had
grown to look ten years older His face was drawn haggard and deathly
pale

For Heavens sake George I exclaimed what is the matter with you

Ive an idea Im spleeny he replied with a ghastly attempt at a
smile This was too much for me He should have the lecture after all
The man who thinks he is dying may be spleeny but the man who says he
is spleeny is of the two the one more likely to be dying

See here old man I began dont you get to thinking that when
you hide your own head in the sand no one can see the colour of your
feathers You might as well try to cover up Bunker Hill Monument with
a wisp of straw Dont you suppose I know you love Gwen Darrow Thats
whats the matter with you

Well he replied and if it is what then

What then I ejaculated What then Why go to her like a man tell
her you love her and ask her to be your wife Thats what Id do if I
loved But he interrupted me before I had finished the lie and I was
not sorry for if I had thought before I became involved in that last
sentence how I feared to speak to Jeannettewell I should have left
it unsaid I have made my living giving advice till it has become a
fixed habit

See here Doc he broke in upon me I do love Gwen Darrow as few men
ever love a woman and the knowledge that she can never be my wife is
killing me Dont interrupt me I know what I am saying She can never
be my wife Do you think I would sue for her hand Do you think I would
be guilty of making traffic of her gratitude Has she not her fathers
command to wed me if I but ask her even as she would have wed that
scoundrel Godin had things gone as he planned them Did she not tell
us both that she should keep her covenant with her father though it
meant for her a fate worse than death And you would have me profit by
her sacrifice For shame Love may wither my heart till it rustles in
my breast like a dried leaf but I will never never let her know how
I love her And see here Doc promise me that you will not tell her I
love hernay I insist on it

Thus importuned I said though it went much against the grain for that
was the very thing I had intended She shall not learn it first through
me This seemed to satisfy him for he said no more upon the subject
When I went back to Gwen I was in no better frame of mind than when I
left her Here were two people so determined to be miserable in spite
of everything and everybody that I sought Jeannette by way of
counterirritant for my wounded sympathy

Ah Jeannette Jeannette to this day the sound of your sweet name is
like a flash of colour to the eye You were a bachelors first and last
love and he will never forget you




CHAPTER V


 All human things ceasesome end Happy are they who can spring
 the hard and brittle bar of experience into a bow of promise For
 such there shall ever more be an orderly gravitation

My next call on Maitland was professional I found him abed and in a
critical condition I blamed myself severely that I had allowed other
duties to keep me so long away and had him at once removed to the
house where I might by constant attendance in the future atone for
my negligence in the past Despite all our efforts however Maitland
steadily grew worse Gwen watched by him night and day until I was
finally obliged to insist on account of her own health that she should
leave the sick room long enough to take the rest she so needed Indeed
I feared lest I should soon have two invalids upon my hands but Gwen
yielded her place to Jeannette and Alice during the nights and soon
began to show the good effects of sleep

I should have told you that during all this time Jeannette was staying
with us as a guest I had convinced her father that it was best she
should remain with us until the unpleasant notoriety caused by his
arrest had in a measure subsided Then too I told him with a
frankness warranted I thought by circumstances that he could not hope
to live many weeks longer and that every effort should be made to make
the blow his death would deal Jeannette as light as possible At this
he almost lost his selfcontrol What will become of my child when I am
gone he moaned I shall leave her penniless and without any means of
support

My dear Mr Latour I replied you need give yourself no uneasiness
on that score I will give you my word as a man of honour that so long
as Miss Darrow and I live we will see that your daughter wants for none
of the necessities of lifeunless she shall find someone who shall
have a better right than either of us to care for her This promise
acted like magic upon him He showered his blessings upon me
exclaiming You have lifted a great load from my heart and I can now
die in peace And so indeed he did In less than a week he was dead
I had prepared Jeannette for the shock and so had her father but
for all this her grief was intense for she loved her father with a
strength of love few children give their parents In time however her
grief grew less insistent and she began to gain something of her old
buoyancy

In the meantime Maitlands life seemed to hang by a single thread It
was the very worst case of nervous prostration I have ever been called
to combat and for weeks we had to be contented if we enabled him to
hold his own During all this time Gwen watched both Maitland and myself
with a closeness that suffered nothing to escape her I think she knew
the changes in his condition better even than I did

And now I am to relate a most singular action on Gwens part I doubt
not most of her own sex would have considered it very unfeminine but
anyone who saw it all as I did could not I think fail to appreciate
the nobility of womanhood which made it possible Gwen was not dominated
by those characteristics usually epitomised in the epithet lady She
was a woman and she possessed in a remarkable degree that fineness of
fibre that solidity of character and that largeness of soul which rise
above the petty conventionalities of life into the broad realm of the
real verities of existence

It occurred on the afternoon of the first day that Maitland showed the
slightest improvement I remember distinctly how he had fallen into
a troubled sleep from which he would occasionally cry out in a
halfarticulate manner and how Gwen and I sat beside him waiting for
him to awaken Suddenly he said something in his sleep that riveted our
attention I tell you Doc he muttered though love of her burn my
heart to a cinder I will never trade upon her gratitude nor seek to
profit by the promise she made her father Never so help me God

Gwen gave me one hurried sweeping glance and then throwing herself
upon the sofa buried her face in the cushions I forbore to disturb her
till I saw that Maitland was waking when I laid my hand upon her head
and asked her to dry her eyes lest he should notice her tears

May I speak to him she said with a look of resolution upon her face
I could not divine her thoughts as she smiled at me through her tears
but I had no hesitancy in relying upon her judgment so I gave her
permission and started to leave the room

Please dont go she said to me I would prefer you should hear
what I have to say I reseated myself and Gwen drew near the bedside
Maitland was now awake and following her every motion

I have something I want to say to you she said bending over him Do
you feel strong enough to listen He nodded his head and she continued
You have already done a great deal for me yet I come to you now to
ask a further favourI will not say a sacrificegreater than all the
rest Will you try to grant it

The rich deep tones of her voice vibrant with tender earnestness
seemed to me irresistible

I will do anything in my power the invalid replied never once moving
his eyes from hers

Then Heaven grant it be within your power she murmured scarcely
above a whisper Try not to despise me for what I am about to say Be
lenient in your judgment My happiness perhaps my very life depends
upon this issue I love you more than life try to love me if only a
little

I watched the effect of this declaration with a good deal of anxiety
For fully half a minute Maitland seemed to doubt the evidence of his
senses I saw him pinch himself to see if he were awake and being thus
reassured he said slowly Trytoloveyou In vain have I tried
not to love you from the moment I first saw you Oh my God how I adore
you He reached his arms out toward her and in a moment they were
locked in each others embrace

I saw the first kiss given and then stole stealthily from the room
There was now no need of a doctor The weird irresistible alchemy of
love was at work and the reign of medicine was over I did not wish to
dim the newly found light by my shadow andwellI wanted to see
Jeannette so I left

I need not tell you even though you are a bachelor how fast Maitland
improved Gwen would permit no one else to nurse him and this had much
to do with the rapidity of his recovery In a month he was able to go
out and in another month Gwen became Mrs Maitland A happier pair or
one better suited to each other it has never been my privilege to know
As I visited them in their new home I became more and more dissatisfied
with bachelor existence and there were times when I had half a mind
to go straight to Jeannette and ask her advice in the matter Ah those
days They will never come to me again Never again will a pink and
white angel knock so loudly at my heart or be so warmly welcomed I
wonder where she is and if she is thinking of me


And now I may as well stop for my narrative is over and I hear someone
coming along the hail doubtless after me It is only Harold so I
may add a word or two more I am writing now with difficulty for some
frolicsome individual has placed a hand over my eyes and says Guess
I can just see to write between the fingers Again I am commanded
Guess so I say carelessly Alice Then would you believe it
someone kisses me and says Will you ever have done with that writing
The children wish me to inform you that they have some small claim upon
your time You see how it is Ive got to stop so I say as becomes an
obedient gentleman Very well I will quit upon one condition I have
been wondering where on earth you were Tell me what you have been doing
with yourself I have been repeating in retrospect all the horrors of
bachelordom

Why Ned dear my wife replies Ive only been downtown shopping for
Harold and little Jeannette Bless me I should think Id been gone a
year

Bless you my dear Jeannette I reply I should think you had and
I draw her down gently into my lap and kiss her again and again for
the sake of the conviction it will carry She says I am smothering her
which means she is convinced


You see I have learned some things since I was a bachelor

Section 4 Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

 wwwgutenbergorg

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
