Chapter I A Triangular Alliance


 Edina Scotias Darling seat
 All hail thy palaces and towers


Edinburgh April 189

22 Breadalbane Terrace

We have travelled together before Salemina Francesca and I and we
know the very worst there is to know about one another After this point
has been reached it is as if a triangular marriage had taken place
and with the honeymoon comfortably over we slip along in thoroughly
friendly fashion I use no warmer word thanfriendly because in the
first place the highest tides of feeling do not visit the coasts of
triangular alliances and because in the second place friendly is
a word capable of putting to the blush many a more passionate and
endearing one

Every one knows of our experiences in England for we wrote volumes
of letters concerning them the which were widely circulated among
our friends at the time and read aloud under the evening lamps in the
several cities of our residence

Since then few striking changes have taken place in our history

Salemina returned to Boston for the winter to find to her amazement
that for forty odd years she had been rather overestimating it

On arriving in New York Francesca discovered that the young lawyer whom
for six months she had been advising to marry somebody more worthy than
herself was at last about to do it This was somewhat in the nature of
a shock for Francesca had been in the habit ever since she was
seventeen of giving her lovers similar advice and up to this time no
one of them has ever taken it She therefore has had the not unnatural
hope I think of organising at one time or another all these
disappointed and faithful swains into a celibate brotherhood and
perhaps of driving by the interesting monastery with her husband and
calling his attention modestly to the fact that these poor monks were
filling their barren lives with deeds of piety trying to remember their
Creator with such assiduity that they might in time forget Her

Her chagrin was all the keener at losing this last aspirant to her hand
in that she had almost persuaded herself that she was as fond of him as
she was likely to be of anybody and that on the whole she had better
marry him and save his life and reason

Fortunately she had not communicated this gleam of hope by letter
feeling I suppose that she would like to see for herself the light
of joy breaking over his pale cheek The scene would have been rather
pretty and touching but meantime the Worm had turned and despatched a
letter to the Majestic at the quarantine station telling her that he
had found a less reluctant bride in the person of her intimate friend
Miss Rosa Van Brunt and so Francescas dream of duty and sacrifice was
over

Salemina says she was somewhat constrained for a week and a trifle
cynical for a fortnight but that afterwards her spirits mounted on ever
ascending spirals to impossible heights where they have since remained
It appears from all this that although she was piqued at being taken at
her word her heart was not in the least damaged It never was one of
those fragile things which have to be wrapped in cotton and preserved
from the slightest blowFrancescas heart It is made of excellent
stout durable material and I often tell her with the care she takes of
it and the moderate strain to which it is subjected it ought to be as
good as new a hundred years hence

As for me the scene of my own lovestory is laid in America and
England and has nought to do with Edinburgh It is far from finished
indeed I hope it will be the longest serial on record one of those
charming tales that grow in interest as chapter after chapter unfolds
until at the end we feel as if we could never part with the delightful
people

I should be at this very moment Mrs William Beresford a highly
respectable young matron who painted rather good pictures in her
spinster days when she was Penelope Hamilton of the great American
workingclass Unlimited but first Mrs Beresfords dangerous illness
and then her death have kept my dear boy a willing prisoner in Cannes
his heart sadly torn betwixt his love and duty to his mother and his
desire to be with me The separation is virtually over now and we two
alas have neer a mother or a father between us so we shall not wait
many months before beginning to comfort each other in good earnest

Meantime Salemina and Francesca have persuaded me to join their forces
and Mr Beresford will follow us to Scotland in a few short weeks when
we shall have established ourselves in the country

We are overjoyed at being together again we three women folk As I said
before we know the worst of one another and the future has no terrors
We have learned for example that

Francesca does not like an early morning start Salemina refuses to
arrive late anywhere Penelope prefers to stay behind and follow next
day

Francesca scorns to travel third class So does Salemina but she will
if urged

Penelope hates a fourwheeler Salemina is nervous in a hansom
Francesca prefers a barouche or a landau

Salemina likes a steady fire in the grate Penelope opens a window and
fans herself

Salemina inclines to instructive and profitable expeditions Francesca
loves processions and sightseeing Penelope abhors all of these equally

Salemina likes history Francesca loves fiction Penelope adores poetry
and detests facts

Penelope likes substantial breakfasts Francesca dislikes the sight of
food in the morning

In the matter of breakfasts when we have leisure to assert our
individual tastes Salemina prefers tea Francesca cocoa and I coffee
We can never therefore be served with a large comfortable pot of
anything but are confronted instead with a caravan of silver jugs
china jugs bowls of hard and soft sugar hot milk cold milk hot
water and cream while each in her secret heart wishes that the other
two were less exigeante in the matter of diet and beverages

This does not sound promising but it works perfectly well in practice
by the exercise of a little flexibility

As we left dear old Dovermarle Street and Smiths Private Hotel behind
and drove to the station to take the Flying Scotsman we indulged in
floods of reminiscence over the joys of travel we had tasted together
in the past and talked with lively anticipation of the new experiences
awaiting us in the land of heather

While Salemina went to purchase the three firstclass tickets I
superintended the porters as they disposed our luggage in the van and
in so doing my eye lighted upon a thirdclass carriage which was for
a wonder clean comfortable and vacant Comparing it hastily with
the firstclass compartment being held by Francesca I found that it
differed only in having no carpet on the floor and a smaller number
of buttons in the upholstering This was really heartrending when the
difference in fare for three persons would be at least twenty dollars
What a delightful sum to put aside for a rainy daythat is be it
understood what a delightful sum to put aside and spend on the first
rainy day for that is the way we always interpret the expression

When Salemina returned with the tickets she found me as usual
bewailing our extravagance

Francesca descended suddenly from her post and wresting the tickets
from her duenna exclaimed I know that I can save the country and I
know no other man can as William Pitt said to the Duke of Devonshire
I have had enough of this argument For six months of last year we
discussed travelling third class and continued to travel first Get
into that clean hardseated illupholstered thirdclass carriage
immediately both of you save room enough for a mother with two babies
and man carrying a basket of fish and an old woman with five pieces of
handluggage and a dog meanwhile I will exchange the tickets

So saying she disappeared rapidly among the throng of passengers
guards porters newspaper boys golfers with bags of clubs young
ladies with bicycles and old ladies with tin hatboxes

What decision what swiftness of judgment what courage and energy
murmured Salemina Isnt she wonderfully improved since that unexpected
turning of the Worm

Francesca rejoined us just as the guard was about to lock us in and
flung herself down quite breathless from her unusual exertion

Well we are travelling third for once and the money is saved or
at least it is ready to spend again at the first opportunity The man
didnt wish to exchange the tickets at all He says it is never done I
told him they were bought by a very inexperienced American lady that is
you Salemina who knew almost nothing of the distinctions between first
and third class and naturally took the best believing it to be none
too good for a citizen of the greatest republic on the face of the
earth He said the tickets had been stamped on I said so should I be
if I returned without exchanging them He was a very dense person and
didnt see my joke at all but then it is true there were thirteen men
in line behind me with the train starting in three minutes and there
is nothing so debilitating to a naturally weak sense of humour as
selling tickets behind a grating so I am not really vexed with him
There we are quite comfortable pending the arrival of the babies the
dog and the fish and certainly no vendor of periodic literature will
dare approach us while we keep these books in evidence

She had Laurence Huttons Literary Landmarks and Royal Edinburgh by
Mrs Oliphant I had Lord Cockburns Memorials of his Time and
somebody had given Salemina at the moment of leaving London a work on
Scotiass darling seat in three huge volumes When all this printed
matter was heaped on the top of Saleminas holdall on the platform the
guard had asked Do you belong to these books maam

We may consider ourselves injured in going from London to Edinburgh in
a thirdclass carriage in eight or ten hours but listen to this said
Salemina who had opened one of her large volumes at random when the
train started

The Edinburgh and London Stagecoach begins on Monday 13th October
1712 All that desire let them repair to the Coach and Horses at the
head of the Canongate every Saturday or the Black Swan in Holborn every
other Monday at both of which places they may be received in a coach
which performs the whole journey in thirteen days without any stoppage
if God permits having eighty able horses Each passenger paying 4
pounds 10 shillings for the whole journey allowing each 20 lbs weight
and all above to pay 6 pence per lb The coach sets off at six in the
morning you could never have caught it Francesca and is performed
by Henry Harrison And here is a modern improvement fortytwo years
later In July 1754 the Edinburgh Courant advertises the stagecoach
drawn by six horses with a postilion on one of the leaders as a new
genteel twoend glass machine hung on steel springs exceedingly light
and easy to go in ten days in summer and twelve in winter Passengers
to pay as usual Performed if God permits by your dutiful servant
Hosea Eastgate CARE IS TAKEN OF SMALL PARCELS ACCORDING TO THEIR
VALUE

It would have been a long wearisome journey said I contemplatively
but nevertheless I wish we were making it in 1712 instead of a
century and threequarters later

What would have been happening Salemina asked Francesca politely
but with no real desire to know

The Union had been already established five years began Salemina
intelligently

Which Union

Whose Union

Salemina is used to these interruptions and eruptions of illiteracy on
our part I think she rather enjoys them as in the presence of such
complete ignorance as ours her lamp of knowledge burns all the brighter

Anne was on the throne she went on with serene dignity

What Anne

I know all about Anne exclaimed Francesca She came from the
Midnight Sun country or up that way She was very extravagant and had
something to do with Jingling Geordie in The Fortunes of Nigel It is
marvellous how ones history comes back to one

Quite marvellous said Salemina dryly or at least the state in which
it comes back is marvellous I am not a stickler for dates as you
know but if you could only contrive to fix a few periods in your minds
girls just in a general way you would not be so shamefully befogged
Your Anne of Denmark Francesca was the wife of James VI of Scotland
who was James I of England and she died a hundred years before the
Anne I meanthe last of the Stuarts you know My Anne came after
William and Mary and before the Georges

Which William and Mary

What Georges

But this was too much even for Saleminas equanimity and she retired
behind her book in dignified displeasure while Francesca and I meekly
looked up the Annes in a genealogical table and tried to decide whether
b1665 meant born or beheaded



Chapter II Edina Scotias Darling Seat



The weather that greeted us on our unheralded arrival in Scotland was of
the precise sort offered by Edinburgh to her unfortunate queen when

 After a youth by woes oercast
 After a thousand sorrows past
 The lovely Mary once again
 Set foot upon her native plain

John Knox records of those memorable days The very face of heaven did
manifestlie speak what comfort was brought to this country with hirto
wit sorrow dolour darkness and all impietyfor in the memorie of man
never was seen a more dolorous face of the heavens than was seen at
her arryvall the myst was so thick that skairse micht onie man espy
another and the sun was not seyn to shyne two days befoir nor two days
after

We could not see Edinas famous palaces and towers because of the haar
that damp chilling drizzling dripping fog or mist which the east wind
summons from the sea but we knew that they were there shrouded in the
heart of that opaque mysterious greyness and that before many hours
our eyes would feast upon their beauty

Perhaps it was the weather but I could think of nothing but poor Queen
Mary She had drifted into my imagination with the haar so that I could
fancy her homesick gaze across the water as she murmured Adieu ma
chere France Je ne vous verray jamais pluscould fancy her saying as
in Allan Cunninghams verse

 The sun rises bright in France
 And fair sets he
 But he hath tint the blithe blink he had
 In my ain countree

And then I recalled Marys first goodnight in Edinburgh that serenade
of 500 rascals with vile fiddles and rebecks that singing in bad
accord of Protestant psalms by the wet crowd beneath the palace
windows while the fires on Arthurs Seat shot flickering gleams of
welcome through the dreary fog What a lullaby for poor Mary half
Frenchwoman and all Papist

It is but just to remember the indefatigable and undissuadable John
Knoxs statement the melody lyked her weill and she willed the same
to be continewed some nightis after For my part however I distrust
John Knoxs musical feeling and incline sympathetically to the Sieur
de Brantomes account with its vile fiddles and discordant psalms
although his judgment was doubtless a good deal depressed by what he
called the si grand brouillard that so dampened the spirits of Marys
French retinue

Ah well I was obliged to remember in order to be reasonably happy
myself that Mary had a gay heart after all that she was but nineteen
that though already a widow she did not mourn her young husband as one
who could not be comforted and that she must soon have been furnished
with merrier music than the psalms for another of the sour comments
of the time is Our Queen weareth the dule weeds but she can dance
daily dule and all

These were my thoughts as we drove through invisible streets in the
Edinburgh haar turned into what proved next day to be a Crescent and
drew up to an invisible house with a visible number 22 gleaming over
a door which gaslight transformed into a probability We alighted and
though we could scarcely see the drivers outstretched hand he was
quite able to discern a halfcrown and demanded three shillings

The noise of our cab had brought Mrs MCollop to the doorgood or
at least pretty good Mrs MCollop to whose apartments we had been
commended by English friends who had never occupied them

Dreary as it was without all was comfortable withindoors and a cheery
oneandsixpenny fire crackled in the grate Our private drawingroom
was charmingly furnished and so large that notwithstanding the
presence of a piano two sofas five small tables cabinets desks and
chairsnot forgetting a dainty fiveoclock tea equipagewe might
have given a party in the remaining space

If this is a typical Scotch lodging I like it and if it is Scotch
hospitality to lay the cloth and make the fire before it is asked for
then I call it simply Arabian in character and Salemina drew off her
damp gloves and extended her hands to the blaze

And isnt it delightful that the bill doesnt come in for a whole
week asked Francesca We have only our English experiences on which
to found our knowledge and all is delicious mystery The tea may be a
present from Mrs MCollop and the sugar may not be an extra the fire
may be included in the rent of the apartment and the piano may not
be taken away tomorrow to enhance the attractions of the diningroom
floor It was Francesca you remember who had warstled with the
itemised accounts at Smiths Private Hotel in London and she who was
always obliged to turn pounds shillings and pence into dollars and
cents before she could add or subtract

Come and look at the flowers in my bedroom I called four great
boxes full Mr Beresford must have ordered the carnations because he
always does but where did the roses come from I wonder

I rang the bell and a neat whiteaproned maid appeared

Who brought these flowers please

I cudna say mam

Thank you will you be good enough to ask Mrs MCollop

In a moment she returned with the message There will be a letter in
the box mam

It seems to me the letter should be in the box now if it is ever to
be I thought and I presently drew this card from among the fragrant
buds

Lady Baird sends these Scotch roses as a small return for the pleasure
she has received from Miss Hamiltons pictures Lady Baird will give
herself the pleasure of calling tomorrow meantime she hopes that Miss
Hamilton and her party will dine with her some evening this week

How nice exclaimed Salemina

The celebrated Miss Hamiltons undistinguished party presents its
humble compliments to Lady Baird chanted Francesca and having no
engagements whatever and small hope of any will dine with her on any
and every evening she may name Miss Hamiltons party will wear its best
clothes polish its mental jewels and endeavour in every possible way
not to injure the gifted Miss Hamiltons reputation among the Scottish
nobility

I wrote a hasty note of thanks to Lady Baird and rang the bell

Can I send a message please I asked the maid

I cudna say mam

Will you be good enough to ask Mrs MCollop please

Interval then

The Boots will tak it at seeven oclock mam

Thank you is Fotheringay Crescent near here

I cudna say mam

Thank you what is your name please

I waited in wellgrounded anxiety for I had no idea that she knew her
name or that if she had ever heard it she could say it but to my
surprise she answered almost immediately Susanna Crum mam

What a joy it is in a vexatious world where things gang aft agley to
find something absolutely right

If I had devoted years to the subject having the body of Susanna Crum
before my eyes every minute of the time for inspiration Susanna Crum
is what I should have named that maid Not a vowel could be added not a
consonant omitted I said so when first I saw her and weeks of intimate
acquaintance only deepened my reverence for the parental genius that had
so described her to the world



Chapter III A vision in Princes Street



When we awoke next morning the sun had forgotten itself and was shining
in at Mrs MCollops back windows

We should have arisen at once to burn sacrifices and offer oblations
but we had seen the sun frequently in America and had no idea poor
fools that it was anything to be grateful for so we accepted it
almost without comment as one of the perennial providences of life

When I speak of Edinburgh sunshine I do not mean of course any such
burning wholesouled ardent warmth of beam as one finds in countries
where they make a specialty of climate It is generally speaking a
halfhearted uncertain ray as pale and transitory as a martyrs smile
but its faintest gleam or its most puerile attempt to gleam is admired
and recorded by its welldisciplined constituency Not only that but at
the first timid blink of the sun the true Scotsman remarks smilingly
I think now we shall be having settled weather It is a pathetic
optimism beautiful but quite groundless and leads one to believe in
the story that when Father Noah refused to take Sandy into the ark he
sat down philosophically outside saying with a glance at the clouds
Aweel the days just aboot the ordnar an I wouldna woner if we
saw the sun afore nicht

But what loyal son of Edina cares for these transatlantic gibes and
where is the dweller within her royal gates who fails to succumb to the
sombre beauty of that old grey town of the North Grey why it is grey
or grey and gold or grey and gold and blue or grey and gold and blue
and green or grey and gold and blue and green and purple according as
the heaven pleases and you choose your ground But take it when it is
most sombrely grey where is another such grey city

So says one of her lovers and so the great army of lovers would say
had they the same gift of language for

 Even thus methinks a city reared should be
 Yea an imperial city that might hold
 Five time a hundred noble towns in fee
 Thus should her towers be raised with vicinage
 Of clear bold hills that curve her very streets
 As if to indicate mid choicest seats
 Of Art abiding Natures majesty

We ate a hasty breakfast that first morning and prepared to go out for
a walk into the great unknown perhaps the most pleasurable sensation
in the world Francesca was ready first and having mentioned the fact
several times ostentatiously she went into the drawingroom to wait
and read the Scotsman When we went thither a few minutes later we found
that she had disappeared

She is below of course said Salemina She fancies that we shall
feel more ashamed at our tardiness if we find her sitting on the hall
bench in silent martyrdom

There was no one in the hall however save Susanna who inquired if we
would see the cook before going out

We have no time now Susanna I remarked We are anxious to have a
walk before the weather changes if possible but we shall be out for
luncheon and in for dinner and Mrs MCollop may give us anything she
pleases Do you know where Miss Francesca is

I cudna s

Certainly of course you couldnt but I wonder if Mrs MCollop saw
her

Mrs MCollop appeared from the basement and vouchsafed the information
that she had seen the young leddy rinnin after the regiment

Running after the regiment repeated Salemina automatically What
a reversal of the laws of nature Why in Berlin it was always the
regiment that used to run after her

We learned in what direction the soldiers had gone and pursuing the
same path found the young lady on the corner of a street near by She
was quite unabashed You dont know what you have missed she said
excitedly Let us get into this tram and possibly we can head them off
somewhere They may be going into battle and if so my hearts blood is
at their service It is one of those experiences that come only once
in a lifetime There were pipes and there were kilts I didnt suppose
they ever really wore them outside of the theatre When you have
seen the kilts swinging Salemina you will never be the same woman
afterwards You never expected to see the Olympian gods walking did
you Perhaps you thought they always sat on practicable rocks and made
stiff gestures from the elbow as they do in the Wagner operas Well
these gods walked if you can call the inspired gait a walk If there
is a single spinster left in Scotland it is because none of these ever
asked her to marry him Ah how grateful I ought to be that I am free
to say yes if a kilt ever asks me to be his Poor Penelope yoked to
your commonplace trousered Beresford I wish the tram would go faster
You must capture one of them by fair means or foul Penelope and
Salemina and I will hold him down while you paint himthere they are
they are there somewhere dont you hear them

There they were indeed filing down the grassy slopes of the Gardens
swinging across one of the stone bridges and winding up the Castlehill
to the Esplanade like a long glittering snake the streamers of their
Highland bonnets waving their arms glistening in the sun and the
bagpipes playing The March of the Cameron Men The pipers themselves
were mercifully hidden from us on that first occasion and it was well
for we could never have borne another feathers weight of ecstasy

It was in Princes Street that we had alightednamed thus for the
prince who afterwards became George IVand I hope he was and is
properly grateful It ought never to be called a street this most
magnificent of terraces and the world has cause to bless that interdict
of the Court of Session in 1774 which prevented the Gradgrinds of the
day from erecting buildings along its south sidea sordid scheme that
would have been the very superfluity of naughtiness

It was an envious Glasgow body who said grudgingly as he came out of
Waverley Station and gazed along its splendid length for the
first time Weel wi a their haverin its but half a street
onywaywhich always reminded me of the Western farmer who came from
his native plains to the beautiful Berkshire hills Ive always heard
o this scenery he said Blamed if I can find any scenery but if
there was nobody could see it theres so much high ground in the way

To think that not so much more than a hundred years ago Princes Street
was nought but a straight country road the Lang Dykes and the Lang
Gait as it was called

We looked down over the grassy chasm that separates the New from the
Old Town looked our first on Arthurs Seat that crouching lion of a
mountain saw the Corstorphine Hill and Calton heights and Salisbury
Crags and finally that stupendous bluff of rock that culminates so
majestically in Edinburgh Castle There is something else which like
Susanna Crums name is absolutely and ideally right Stevenson calls it
one of the most satisfactory crags in naturea Bass rock upon dry
land rooted in a garden shaken by passing trains carrying a crown
of battlements and turrets and describing its warlike shadow over the
liveliest and brightest thoroughfare of the new town It dominates
the whole countryside from water and land The men who would have the
courage to build such a castle in such a spot are all dead all dead
and the world is infinitely more comfortable without them They are all
gone and no more like unto them will ever be born and we can most
of us count upon dying safely in our beds of diseases bred of modern
civilisation But I am glad that those old barbarians those rudimentary
creatures working their way up into the divine likeness when they
were not hanging drawing quartering torturing and chopping their
neighbours and using their heads in conventional patterns on the tops
of gateposts did devote their leisure intervals to rearing fortresses
like this Edinburgh Castle could not be conceived much less built
nowadays when all our energy is consumed in bettering the condition
of the submerged tenth What did they care about the masses that
regal race that is now no more when they were hewing those blocks
of rugged rock and piling them against the skyline on the top of that
great stone mountain It amuses me to think how much more picturesque
they left the world and how much better we shall leave it though if
an artist were requested to distribute individual awards to different
generations you could never persuade him to give first prizes to the
centuries that produced steam laundries trolleys X rays and sanitary
plumbing

What did they reck of Peace Congresses and bloodless arbitrations when
they lighted the beaconfires flaming out to the gudeman and his sons
ploughing or sowing in the Lang Dykes the news that their ancient
enemies of England had crossed the Tweed

I am the most peaceful person in the world but the Castle was too much
for my imagination I was mounted and off and away from the first moment
I gazed upon its embattled towers heard the pipers in the distance and
saw the Black Watch swinging up the green steps where the huge fortress
holds its state The modern world had vanished and my
steed was galloping galloping galloping back into the
placeofthethingsthatarepast traversing centuries at every leap

To arms Let every banner in Scotland float defiance to the breeze
So I heard my newborn imaginary spirit say to my real one Yes
and let the Deacon Convener unfurl the sacred Blue Blanket under which
every liege burgher of the kingdom is bound to answer summons The
balefires are gleaming giving alarm to Hume Haddington Dunbar
Dalkeith and Eggerhope Rise Stirling Fife and the North All
Scotland will be under arms in two hours One balefire the English
are in motion Two they are advancing Four in a row they are of great
strength All men in arms west of Edinburgh muster there All eastward
at Haddington And every Englishman caught in Scotland is lawfully the
prisoner of whoever takes him What am I saying I love Englishmen
but the spell is upon me Come on Macduff The only suitable and
familiar challenge my warlike tenant can summon at the moment I am
the son of a Gael My dagger is in my belt and with the guid broadsword
at my side I can with one blow cut a man in twain My bow is cut
from the wood of the yews of Glenure the shaft is from the wood of
Lochetive the feathers from the great golden eagles of Locktreigside
My arrowhead was made by the smiths of the race of Macphedran Come on
Macduff

And now a shopkeeper has filled his window with royal Stuart tartans
and I am instantly a Jacobite

 The Highland clans wi sword in hand
 Frae John o Groats to Airly
 Hae to a man declard to stand
 Or fa wi Royal Charlie

 Come through the heather around him gather
 Come Ronald come Donald come athegither
 And crown your rightfu lawfu king
 For whall be king but Charlie

It is the eve of the battle of Prestonpans Is it not under the Rock
of Dunsappie on yonder Arthurs Seat that our Highland army will encamp
tonight At dusk the prince will hold a council of his chiefs and
nobles I am a chief and a noble and at daybreak we shall march
through the old hedgerows and woods of Duddingston pipes playing and
colours flying bonnie Charlie at the head his claymore drawn and the
scabbard flung away I mean awa

 Then heres a health to Charlies cause
 And bet complete an early
 His very name my hearts blood warms
 To arms for Royal Charlie

 Come through the heather around him gather
 Come Ronald come Donald come athegither
 And crown your rightfu lawfu king
 For whall be king but Charlie

I hope that those in authority will never attempt to convene a Peace
Congress in Edinburgh lest the influence of the Castle be too strong
for the delegates They could not resist it nor turn their backs upon
it since unlike other ancient fortresses it is but a stonesthrow
from the front windows of all the hotels They might mean never so well
but they would end by buying dirk hatpins and claymore brooches for
their wives their daughters would all run after the kilted regiment and
marry as many of the pipers as asked them and before night they would
all be shouting with the noble FitzEustace

 Wheres the coward who would not dare
 To fight for such a land

While I was rhapsodising Salemina and Francesca were shopping in the
Arcade buying some of the cairngorms and Tam OShanter purses and
models of Burnss cottage and copies of Marmion in plaided covers and
thistle beltbuckles and bluebell penwipers with which we afterwards
inundated our native land When my warlike mood had passed I sat down
upon the steps of the Scott monument and watched the passersby in
a sort of waking dream I suppose they were the usual professors and
doctors and ministers who are wont to walk up and down the Edinburgh
streets with a sprinkling of lairds and leddies of high degree and a
few Americans looking at the shop windows to choose their clan tartans
but for me they did not exist In their places stalked the ghosts of
kings and queens and knights and nobles Columba Abbot of Iona Queen
Margaret and Malcolmshe the sweetest saint in all the throng King
David riding towards Drumsheugh forest on Holy Rood day with his horns
and hounds and huntsmen following close behind Anne of Denmark and
Jingling Geordie Mary Stuart in all her girlish beauty with the four
Maries in her train and lurking behind Bothwell that ower sune
stepfaither and the murdered Rizzio and Darnley John Knox in his
black Geneva cloak Bonnie Prince Charlie and Flora Macdonald lovely
Annabella Drummond Robert the Bruce George Heriot with a banner
bearing on it the words I distribute chearfully James I carrying
The Kings Quair Oliver Cromwell and a long line of heroes martyrs
humble saints and princely knaves

Behind them regardless of precedence came the Ploughman Poet and
the Ettrick Shepherd Boswell and Dr Johnson Dr John Brown and Thomas
Carlyle Lady Nairne and Drummond of Hawthornden Allan Ramsay and Sir
Walter and is it not a proof of the Wizards magic art that side by
side with the wraiths of these real people walked or seemed to walk
the Fair Maid of Perth Jeanie Deans Meg Merrilies Guy Mannering

Chapter IV Susanna Crum cudna say



Life at Mrs MCollops apartments in 22 Breadalbane Terrace is about as
simple comfortable dignified and delightful as it well can be

Mrs MCollop herself is neat thrifty precise tolerably genial and
verra releegious

Her partner who is also the cook is a person introduced to us as Miss
Diggity We afterwards learned that this is spelled Dalgety but it is
not considered good form in Scotland to pronounce the names of persons
and places as they are written When therefore I allude to the cook
which will be as seldom as possible I shall speak of her as Miss
DiggityDalgety so that I shall be presenting her correctly both to the
eye and to the ear and giving her at the same time a hyphenated name a
thing which is a secret object of aspiration in Great Britain

In selecting our own letters and parcels from the common stock on the
hall table I perceive that most of our fellowlodgers are hyphenated
ladies whose visitingcards diffuse the intelligence that in their
single persons two ancient families and fortunes are united On
the ground floor are the Misses HepburnSciennes pronounced
HebburnSheens on the floor above us are Miss Colquhoun Cohoon
and her cousin Miss CockburnSinclair CoburnSinkler As soon as
the HepburnSciennes depart Mrs MCollop expects Mrs Menzies of
Kilconquhar of whom we shall speak as Mrs Mingess of Kinyuchar
There is not a man in the house even the Boots is a girl so that
22 Breadalbane Terrace is as truly a castra puellarum as was ever the
Castle of Edinburgh with its maiden princesses in the olden time

We talked with Miss DiggityDalgety on the evening of our first day at
Mrs MCollops when she came up to know our commands As Francesca
and Salemina were both in the room I determined to be as Scotch as
possible for it is Saleminas proud boast that she is taken for a
native of every country she visits

We shall not be entertaining at present Miss Diggity I said so you
can give us just the ordinary dishesno doubt you are accustomed to
them scones baps or bannocks with marmalade finnanhaddie or kippered
herring for breakfast teaof course we never touch coffee in the
morning here Francesca started with surprise porridge and we like
them well boiled please I hope she noted the plural pronoun Salemina
did and blanched with envy minced collops for luncheon or a nice
little blackfaced chop Scotch broth pease brose or cockyleekie soup
at dinner and haggis now and then with a cold shape for dessert That
is about the sort of thing we are accustomed tojust plain Scotch
living

I was impressing Miss DiggityDalgetyI could see that clearly but
Francesca spoiled the effect by inquiring maliciously if we could
sometimes have a howtowdy wi drappit eggs or her favourite dish wee
grumphie wi neeps

Here Salemina was obliged to poke the fire in order to conceal her
smiles and the cook probably suspected that Francesca found howtowdy
in the Scotch glossary but we amused each other vastly and that is our
principal object in life

Miss DiggityDalgetys forebears must have been exposed to foreign
influences for she interlards her culinary conversation with French
terms and we have discovered that this is quite common A jigget of
mutton is of course a gigot and we have identified an ashet as
an assiette The petticoat tails she requested me to buy at the
confectioners were somewhat more puzzling but when they were finally
purchased by Susanna Crum they appeared to be ordinary little cakes
perhaps therefore petits gastels since gastel is an old form of
gateau as was bel for beau Susanna on her part speaks of the
wardrobe in my bedroom as an awmry It certainly contains no weapons
so cannot be an armoury and we conjecture that her word must be a
corruption of armoire

That was a remarkable touch about the blackfaced chop laughed
Salemina when Miss DiggityDalgety had retired not that I believe
they ever say it

I am sure they must I asserted stoutly for I passed a fleshers on
my way home and saw a sign with Prime BlackFaced Mutton printed on
it I also saw Fed Veal but I forgot to ask the cook for it

We ought really to have kept house in Edinburgh observed Francesca
looking up from the Scotsman One can get a selfcontained residential
flat for twenty pounds a month We are such an enthusiastic trio that a
selfcontained flat would be everything to us and if it were not fully
furnished here is a firm that wishes to sell a composite bed for six
pounds and a gents stuffed easy for five Added to these inducements
there is somebody who advertises that parties who intend displenishing
at the Whit Term would do well to consult him as he makes a specialty
of secondhanded furniture and cyclealities What are cyclealities
Susanna She had just come in with coals

I cudna say mam

Thank you no you need not ask Mrs MCollop it is of no
consequence

Susanna Crum is a most estimable young woman clean respectful
willing capable and methodical but as a Bureau of Information she is
painfully inadequate Barring this single limitation she seems to be a
treasurehouse of all good practical qualities and being thus clad and
panoplied in virtue why should she be so timid and selfdistrustful

She wears an expression which can mean only one of two things either
she has heard of the national tomahawk and is afraid of violence on
our part or else her mother was frightened before she was born This
applies in general to her walk and voice and manner but is it fear that
prompts her eternal I cudna say or is it perchance Scotch caution
and prudence Is she afraid of projecting her personality too indecently
far Is it the indirect effect of heresy trials on her imagination Does
she remember the thumbscrew of former generations At all events she
will neither affirm nor deny and I am putting her to all sorts of
tests hoping to discover finally whether she is an accident an
exaggeration or a type

Salemina thinks that our American accent may confuse her Of course she
means Francescas and mine for she has none although we have
tempered ours so much for the sake of the natives that we can scarcely
understand each other any more As for Susannas own accent she comes
from the heart of Aberdeenshire and her intonation is beyond my power
to reproduce

We naturally wish to identify all the national dishes so Is this
cockle soup Susanna I ask her as she passes me the plate at dinner

I cudna say

This vegetable is new to me Susanna is it perhaps seakale

I canna say mam

Then finally in despair as she handed me a boiled potato one day
I fixed my searching Yankee brown eyes on her bluePresbyterian
noncommittal ones and asked What is this vegetable Susanna

In an instant she withdrew herself her soul her ego so utterly that
I felt myself gazing at an inscrutable stone image as she replied I
cudna say mam

This was too much Her mother may have been frightened very badly
frightened but this was more that I could endure without protest The
plain boiled potato is practically universal It is not only common to
all temperate climates but it has permeated all classes of society
I am confident that the plain boiled potato has been one of the chief
constituents in the building up of that frame in which Susanna Crum
conceals her opinions and emotions I remarked therefore as an
apparent afterthought Why it is a potato is it not Susanna

What do you think she replied when thus hunted into a corner pushed
against a wall driven to the very confines of her personal and national
liberty She subjected the potato to a second careful scrutiny and
answered I wudna say its no

Now there is no inherited physical terror in this It is the
concentrated essence of intelligent reserve caution and obstinacy
it is a conscious intellectual hedging it is a dogged and determined
attempt to build up barriers of defence between the questioner and the
questionee it must be therefore the offspring of the catechism and
the heresy trial

Once again after establishing an equally obvious fact I succeeded in
wringing from her the reluctant admission It depends but she was so
shattered by the bulk and force of this outgo so fearful that in some
way she had imperilled her life or reputation so anxious concerning the
effect that her unwilling testimony might have upon unborn generations
that she was of no real service the rest of the day

I wish that the Lord Advocate or some modern counterpart of Braxfield
the hanging judge would summon Susanna Crum as a witness in an
important case He would need his longest plummet to sound the depths of
her consciousness

I have had no legal experience but I can imagine the scene

Is the prisoner your father Susanna Crum

I cudna say my lord

You have not understood the question Susanna Is the prisoner your
father

I cudna say my lord

Come come my girl you must answer the questions put you by the
court You have been an inmate of the prisoners household since your
earliest consciousness He provided you with food lodging and clothing
during your infancy and early youth You have seen him on annual
visits to your home and watched him as he performed the usual parental
functions for your younger brothers and sisters I therefore repeat is
the prisoner your father Susanna Crum

I wudna say hes no my lord

This is really beyond credence What do you conceive to be the idea
involved in the word father Susanna Crum

It depends my lord

And this a few hundred years earlier would have been the natural and
effective moment for the thumbscrews

I do not wish to be understood as defending these uncomfortable
appliances They would never have been needed to elicit information from
me for I should have spent my nights inventing matter to confess in
the daytime I feel sure that I should have poured out such floods
of confessions and retractations that if all Scotland had been one
listening ear it could not have heard my tale I am only wondering if
in the extracting of testimony from the common mind the thumbscrew
might not have been more necessary with some nations than with others



Chapter V We emulate the Jackdaw



Invitations had been pouring in upon us since the delivery of our
letters of introduction and it was now the evening of our debut in
Edinburgh society Francesca had volunteered to perform the task of
leaving cards ordering a private victoria for the purpose and arraying
herself in purple and fine linen

Much depends upon the first impression she had said Miss Hamiltons
party may not be gifted but it is welldressed My hope is that
some of our future hostesses will be looking from the secondstory
frontwindows If they are I can assure them in advance that I shall be
a national advertisement

It is needless to remark that as it began to rain heavily as she was
leaving the house she was obliged to send back the open carriage
and order to save time one of the public cabs from the stand in the
Terrace

Would you mind having the lamiter being first in line asked Susanna
of Salemina who had transmitted the command

When Salemina fails to understand anything the world is kept in
complete ignoranceLeast of all would she stoop to ask a humble
maidservant to translate the vernacular of the country so she replied
affably Certainly Susanna that is the kind we always prefer I
suppose it is covered

Francesca did not notice until her coachman alighted to deliver the
first letter and cards that he had one club foot and one wooden leg
it was then that the full significance of lamiter came to her He was
covered however as Salemina had supposed and the occurrence gave us
a precious opportunity of chaffing that dungeon of learning He was
tolerably alert and vigorous too although he certainly did not impart
elegance to a vehicle and he knew every street in the court end of
Edinburgh and every close and wynd in the Old Town On this our first
meeting with him he faltered only when Francesca asked him last of all
to drive to Kildonan House Helmsdale supposing not unnaturally
that it was as well known an address as Morningside House Tipperlinn
whence she had just come The lamiter had never heard of Kildonan House
nor of Helmsdale and he had driven in the streets of Auld Reekie for
thirty years None of the drivers whom he consulted could supply any
information Susanna Crum cudna say that she had ever heard of it nor
could Mrs MCollop nor could Miss DiggityDalgety It was reserved for
Lady Baird to explain that Helmsdale was two hundred and eighty miles
north and that Kildonan House was ten miles from the Helmsdale railway
station so that the poor lamiter would have had a weary drive even had
he known the way The friends who had given us letters to Mr and Mrs
JamesonInglis JimmysonIngals must have expected us either to visit
John o Groats on the northern border and drop in on Kildonan House
en route or to send our note of introduction by post and await an
invitation to pass the summer At all events the anecdote proved very
pleasing to our Edinburgh acquaintances I hardly know whether if they
should visit America they would enjoy tales of their own stupidity
as hugely as they did the tales of ours but they really were very
appreciative in this particular and it is but justice to ourselves to
say that we gave them every opportunity for enjoyment

But I must go back to our first grand dinner in Scotland We were
dressed at quarterpast seven when in looking at the invitation again
we discovered that the dinnerhour was eight oclock not seventhirty
Susanna did not happen to know the exact approximate distance to
Fotheringay Crescent but the maiden Boots affirmed that it was only two
minutes drive so we sat down in front of the fire to chat

It was Lady Bairds birthday feast to which we had been bidden and
we had done our best to honour the occasion We had prepared a large
bouquet tied with the Maclean tartan Lady Baird is a Maclean and had
printed in gold letters on one of the ribbons Another for Hector the
battlecry of the clan We each wore a sprig of holly because it is the
badge of the family while I added a girdle and shoulderknot of
tartan velvet to my pale green gown and borrowed Francescas emerald
necklacepersuading her that she was too young to wear such jewels in
the old country

Francesca was miserably envious that she had not thought of tartans
first You may consider yourself geyan fine all covered over with
Scotch plaid but I wouldnt be so kenspeckle for worlds she said
using expressions borrowed from Mrs MCollop and as for disguising
your nationality do not flatter yourself that you look like anything
but an American I forgot to tell you the conversation I overheard in
the tram this morning between a mother and daughter who were talking
about us I dare say Have they any proper frocks for so large a party
Bella asked the mother

I thought I explained in the beginning mamma that they are
Americans

Still you know they are only travellingjust passing through as
it were they may not be familiar with our customs and we do want our
party to be a smart one

Wait until you see them mamma and you will probably feel like hiding
your diminished head It is my belief that if an American lady takes a
halfhour journey in a tram she carries full evening dress and a diamond
necklace in case anything should happen on the way I am not in the
least nervous about their appearance I only hope that they will not be
too exuberant American girls are so frightfully vivacious and informal
I always feel as if I were being taken by the throat

A picturesque though rather vigorous expression however it does
no harm to be perfectly dressed said Salemina consciously putting a
steel embroidered slipper on the fender and settling the holly in the
silver folds of her gown then when they discover that we are all well
bred and that one of us is intelligent it will be the more credit to
the country that gave us birth

Of course it is impossible to tell what country did give YOU birth
retorted Francesca but that will only be to your advantageaway from
home

Francesca is inflexibly almost aggressively American but Salemina is a
citizen of the world If the United States should be involved in a war
I am confident that Salemina would be in front with the other Gatling
guns for in that case a principle would be at stake but in all lesser
matters she is extremely unprejudiced She prefers German music Italian
climate French dressmakers English tailors Japanese manners and
AmericanAmerican somethingI have forgotten just what it is either
the icecream soda or the form of governmentI cant remember which

I wonder why they named it Fotheringay Crescent mused Francesca
Some association with Mary Stuart of course Poor poor pretty lady
A free queen only six years and think of the number of beds she slept
in and the number of trees she planted we have already seen I am
afraid to say how many When did she govern when did she scheme
above all when did she flirt with all this racing and chasing over the
country Mrs MCollop calls Anne of Denmark a sad scattercash and
Mary an awfu gadabout and I am inclined to agree with her By the
way when she was making my bed this morning she told me that her
mother claimed descent from the Stewarts of Appin whoever they may be
She apologised for Queen Marys defects as if she were a distant family
connection If so then the famous Stuart charm has been lost somewhere
for Mrs MCollop certainly possesses no alluring curves of temperament

I am going to select some distinguished ancestors this very minute
before I go to my first Edinburgh dinner said I decidedly It seems
hard that ancestors should have everything to do with settling our
nationality and our position in life and we not have a word to say How
nice it would be to select ones own after one had arrived at years
of discretion or to adopt different ones according to the country one
chanced to be visiting I am going to do it it is unusual but there
must be a pioneer in every good movement Let me think do help me
Salemina I am a Hamilton to begin with I might be descended from the
logical Sir William himself and thus become the idol of the university
set

He died only about thirty years ago and you would have to be his
daughter that would never do said Salemina Why dont you take
Thomas Hamilton Earl of Melrose and Haddington He was Secretary of
State Kings Advocate Lord President of the Court of Session and all
sorts of fine things He was the one King James used to call Tam o the
Cowgate

Perfectly delightful I dont care so much about his other titles but
Tam o the Cowgate is irresistible I will take him He was mywhat
was he

He was at least your greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather that is a
safe distance Then theres that famous Jenny Geddes who flung her
fauldstule at the Dean in St Gilesshe was a Hamilton too if you
fancy her

Yes Ill take her with pleasure I responded thankfully Of course
I dont know why she flung the stoolit may have been very
reprehensible but there is always good stuff in stoolflingers its
the sort of spirit one likes to inherit in diluted form Now whom will
you take

I havent even a peg on which to hang a Scottish ancestor said
Salemina disconsolately

Oh nonsense think harder Anybody will do as a startingpoint only
you must be honourable and really show relationship as I did with Jenny
and Tam

My aunt MaryEmma married a Lindsay ventured Salemina hesitatingly

That will do I answered delightedly

 The Gordons gay in English blude
 They wat their hose and shoon
 The Lindsays flew like fire aboot
 Till a the fray was dune

You can play that you are one of the famous licht Lindsays and you
can look up the particular ancestor in your big book Now Francesca
its your turn

I am American to the backbone she declared with insufferable
dignity I do not desire any foreign ancestors

Francesca I expostulated Do you mean to tell me that you can dine
with a lineal descendant of Sir Fitzroy Donald Maclean Baronet of
Duart and Morven and not make any effort to trace your genealogy back
further than your parents

If you goad me to desperation she answered I will wear an
American flag in my hair declare that my father is a Red Indian or a
porkpacker and talk about the superiority of our checking system and
hotels all the evening I dont want to go any way It is sure to
be stiff and ceremonious and the man who takes me in will ask me the
population of Chicago and the amount of wheat we exported last yearhe
always does

I cant see why he should said I I am sure you dont look as if you
knew

My looks have thus far proved no protection she replied sadly
Salemina is so flexible and you are so dramatic that you enter into
all these experiences with zest You already more than half believe
in that Tam o the Cowgate story But therell be nothing for me in
Edinburgh society it will be all clergymen

Ministers interjected Saleminaall ministers and professors My
Redfern gowns will be unappreciated and my Worth evening frocks worse
than wasted

There are a few thousand medical students I said encouragingly and
all the young advocates and a sprinkling of military menthey know
Worth frocks

And continued Salemina bitingly there will always be even in an
intellectual city like Edinburgh a few men who continue to escape
all the developing influences about them and remain commonplace
conventional manikins devoted to dancing and flirting Never fear they
will find you

This sounds harsh but nobody minds Salemina least of all Francesca
who well knows that she is the apple of that spinsters eye But at
this moment Susanna opens the door timorously as if there might be a
panther behind it and announces the cab in the same tone in which she
would announce the beast we pick up our draperies and are whirled off
by the lamiter to dine with the Scottish nobility



Chapter VI Edinburgh society past and present



 Wha last beside his chair shall fa
 He is the king amang us three

It was the Princess Dashkoff who said in the latter part of the
eighteenth century that of all the societies of men of talent she
had met with in her travels Edinburghs was the first in point of
abilities

One might make the same remark today perhaps and not depart widely
from the truth One does not find however as many noted names as are
associated with the annals of the Cape and Poker Clubs or the Crochallan
Fencibles those famous groups of famous men who met for relaxation and
intoxication I should think at the old Isle of Man Arms or in Dawneys
Tavern in the Anchor Close These groups included such shining lights
as Robert Fergusson the poet and Adam Ferguson the historian and
philosopher Gavin Wilson Sir Henry Raeburn David Hume Erskine
Lords Newton Gillies Monboddo Hailes Kames Henry Mackenzie and the
Ploughman Poet himself who has kept alive the memory of the Crochallans
in many a jovial verse like that in which he describes Smellie the
eccentric philosopher and printer

 Shrewd Willie Smellie to Crochallan came
 The old cocked hat the grey surtout the same
 His bristling beard just rising in its might
 Twas four long nights and days to shaving night

or in the characteristic picture of William Dunbar a wit of the time
and the merriest of the Fencibles

 As I cam by Crochallan
 I cannily keekit ben
 Rattlin roarin Willie
 Was sitting at yon boord en
 Sitting at yon boord en
 And amang guid companie
 Rattlin roarin Willie
 Yere welcome hame to me

or in the verses on Creech Burnss publisher who left Edinburgh for a
time in 1789 The Willies by the way seem to be especially inspiring
to the Scottish balladists

 Oh Willie was a witty wight
 And had o things an unco slight
 Auld Reekie aye he keepit tight
 And trig and braw
 But now theyll busk her like a fright
 Willies awa

I think perhaps the gatherings of the present time are neither quite as
gay nor quite as brilliant as those of Burnss day when

 Willie brewed a peck o maut
 An Rob an Allan cam to pree

but the ideal standard of those meetings seems to be voiced in the
lines

 Wha last beside his chair shall fa
 He is the king amang us three

As they sit in their chairs nowadays to the very end of the feast there
is doubtless joined with modern sobriety a soupcon of modern dulness and
discretion

To an American the great charm of Edinburgh is its leisurely atmosphere
not the leisure of a village arising from the deficiency of ideas and
motives but the leisure of a city reposing grandly on tradition and
history which has done its work and does not require to weave its own
clothing to dig its own coals or smelt its own iron

We were reminded of this more than once and it never failed to depress
us properly If one had ever lived in Pittsburg Fall River or
Kansas City I should think it would be almost impossible to maintain
selfrespect in a place like Edinburgh where the citizens are released
from the vulgarising dominion of the hour Whenever one of Auld
Reekies great men took this tone with me I always felt as though I
were the germ in a halfhatched egg and he were an aged and lordly cock
gazing at me pityingly through my shell He lucky creature had lived
through all the struggles which I was to undergo he indeed was
released from the vulgarising dominion of the hour but I poor thing
must grow and grow and keep pecking at my shell in order to achieve
existence

Sydney Smith says in one of his letters Never shall I forget the
happy days passed there in Edinburgh amidst odious smells barbarous
sounds bad suppers excellent hearts and the most enlightened and
cultivated understandings His only criticism of the conversation of
that day 17971802 concerned itself with the prevalence of that form
of Scotch humour which was called wut and with the disputations and
dialectics We were more fortunate than Sydney Smith because Edinburgh
has outgrown its odious smells barbarous sounds and bad suppers and
wonderful to relate has kept its excellent hearts and its enlightened
and cultivated understandings As for mingled wut and dialectics where
can one find a better foundation for dinnertable conversation

The hospitable board itself presents no striking differences from
our own save the customs of serving sweets in soupplates with
dessertspoons of a smaller number of forks on parade of the
invariable fishknife at each plate of the prevalent savoury and
cold shape and the unusual grace and skill with which the hostess
carves Even at very large dinners one occasionally sees a lady of high
degree severing the joints of chickens and birds most daintily while
her lord looks on in happy idleness thinking perhaps how greatly
times have changed for the better since the ages of strife and
bloodshed when Scottish nobles

 Carved at the meal with gloves of steel
 And drank their wine through helmets barred

The Scotch butler is not in the least like an English one No man could
be as respectable as he looks not even an elder of the kirk whom he
resembles closely He hands your plate as if it were a contributionbox
and in his moments of ease when he stands behind the maister I am
always expecting him to pronounce a benediction The English butler
when he wishes to avoid the appearance of listening to the conversation
gazes with level eye into vacancy the Scotch butler looks distinctly
heavenward as if he were brooding on the principle of coordinate
jurisdiction with mutual subordination It would be impossible for me to
deny the key of the winecellar to a being so steeped in sanctity but
it has been done I am told in certain rare and isolated cases

As for toilets the men dress like all other men alas and alas that
we should say it for we were continually hoping for a kilt though
there seems to be no survival of the finical Lord Napiers spirit
Perhaps you remember that Lord and Lady Napier arrived at Castlemilk
in Lanarkshire with the intention of staying a week but announced next
morning that a circumstance had occurred which rendered it indispensable
to return without delay to their seat in Selkirkshire This was the only
explanation given but it was afterwards discovered that Lord Napiers
valet had committed the grievous mistake of packing up a set of
neckcloths which did not correspond IN POINT OF DATE with the shirts
they accompanied

The ladies of the smart set in Edinburgh wear French fripperies
and chiffons as do their sisters every where but the other women of
society dress a trifle more staidly than their cousins in London
Paris or New York The sobriety of taste and severity of style that
characterise Scotswomen may be due like Susanna Crums dubieties to
the haar to the shorter catechism or perhaps in some degree to the
presence of three branches of the Presbyterian Church among them the
society that bears in its bosom three separate and antagonistic kinds of
Presbyterianism at the same time must have its chilly moments

In Lord Cockburns time the dames of high and aristocratic breed
must have been sufficiently awake to feminine frivolities to be both
gorgeously and extravagantly arrayed I do not know in all literature
a more delicious and lifelike wordportrait than Lord Cockburn gives
of Mrs Rochead the Lady of Inverleith in the Memorials It is quite
worthy to hang beside a Raeburn canvas one can scarce say more

Except Mrs Siddons in some of her displays of magnificent royalty
nobody could sit down like the Lady of Inverleith She would sail like a
ship from Tarshish gorgeous in velvet or rustling silk done up in
all the accompaniments of fans earrings and fingerrings falling
sleeves scentbottle embroidered bag hoop and train managing all
this seemingly heavy rigging with as much ease as a fullblown swan does
its plumage She would take possession of the centre of a large sofa
and at the same moment without the slightest visible exertion cover
the whole of it with her bravery the graceful folds seeming to lay
themselves over it like summer waves The descent from her carriage
too where she sat like a nautilus in its shell was a display which no
one in these days could accomplish or even fancy The mulberrycoloured
coach apparently not too large for what it contained though she alone
was in it the handsome jolly coachman and his splendid hammercloth
loaded with lace the two respectful liveried footmen one on each side
of the richly carpeted stepthese were lost sight of amidst the slow
majesty with which the Lady of Inverleith came down and touched the
earth

My righthand neighbour at Lady Bairds dinner was surprised at
my quoting Lord Cockburn Ones attendant squires here always seem
surprised when one knows anything but they are always delighted too
so that the amazement is less trying True I had read the Memorials
only the week before and had never heard of them previous to that time
but that detail according to my theories makes no real difference The
woman who knows how and when to read up who reads because she wants
to be in sympathy with a new environment the woman who has wit and
perspective enough to be stimulated by novel conditions and kindled by
fresh influences who is susceptible to the vibrations of other peoples
history is safe to be fairly intelligent and extremely agreeable
if only she is sufficiently modest I think my neighbour found me
thoroughly delightful after he discovered my point of view He was an
earl and it always takes an earl a certain length of time to understand
me I scarcely know why for I certainly should not think it courteous
to interpose any real barriers between the nobility and that portion of
the masses represented in my humble person

It seemed to me at first that the earl did not apply himself to the
study of my national peculiarities with much assiduity but wasted
considerable time in gazing at Francesca who was opposite She is
certainly very handsome and I never saw her lovelier than at that
dinner her eyes were like stars and her cheeks and lips a splendid
crimson for she was quarrelling with her attendant cavalier about the
relative merits of Scotland and America and they apparently ceased to
speak to each other after the salad

When the earl had sufficiently piqued me by his devotion to his dinner
and his glances at Francesca I began a systematic attempt to achieve
his transient subjugation Of course I am ardently attached to Willie
Beresford and prefer him to any earl in Britain but ones selfrespect
demands something in the way of food I could see Salemina at the far
end of the table radiant with success the WS at her side bending ever
and anon to catch the artificial pearls of thought that dropped from
her lips Miss Hamilton appears simple I thought I heard her say
but in reality she is as deep as the Currie Brig Now where did she
get that allusion And again when the WS asked her whither she was
going when she left Edinburgh I hardly know she replied pensively
I am waiting for the shade of Montrose to direct me as the Viscount
Dundee said to your Duke of Gordon The entranced Scotsman little knew
that she had perfected this style of conversation by long experience
with the QCs of England Talk about my being as deep as the Currie
Brig whatever it may be Salemina is deeper than the Atlantic Ocean I
shall take pains to inform her Writer to the Signet after dinner that
she eats sugar on her porridge every morning that will show him her
nationality conclusively

The earl took the greatest interest in my new ancestors and approved
thoroughly of my choice He thinks I must have been named for Lady
Penelope Belhaven who lived in Leven Lodge one of the country villas
of the Earls of Leven from whom he himself is descended Does that
make us relatives I asked Relatives most assuredly he replied
but not too near to destroy the charm of friendship

He thought it a great deal nicer to select ones own forebears than to
allow them all the responsibility and said it would save a world of
trouble if the method could be universally adopted He added that he
should be glad to part with a good many of his but doubted whether I
would accept them as they were rather a scratch lot I use his own
language which I thought delightfully easy for a belted earl He was
charmed with the story of Francesca and the lamiter and offered to
drive me to Kildonan House Helmsdale on the first fine day I told him
he was quite safe in making the proposition for we had already had the
fine day and we understood that the climate had exhausted itself and
retired for the season

The gentleman on my left a distinguished Dean of the Thistle gave me a
few moments discomfort by telling me that the old custom of rounds
of toasts still prevailed at Lady Bairds on formal occasions and that
before the ladies retired every one would be called upon for appropriate
sentiments

What sort of sentiments I inquired quite overcome with terror

Oh epigrammatic sentences expressive of moral feelings or virtues
replied my neighbour easily They are not quite as formal and hackneyed
now as they were in the olden time when some of the favourite toasts
were May the pleasure of the evening bear the reflections of the
morning May the friends of our youth be the companions of our old
age May the honest heart never feel distress May the hand of
charity wipe the eye of sorrow

I can never do it in the world I ejaculated Oh one ought never
never to leave ones own country A lightminded and cynical English
gentleman told me that I should frequently be called upon to read hymns
and recite verses of Scripture at family dinners in Edinburgh and I
hope I am always prepared to do that but nobody warned me that I should
have to evolve epigrammatic sentiments on the spur of the moment

My confusion was so evident that the good dean relented and confessed
that he was imposing upon my ignorance He made me laugh heartily at the
story of a poor dominie at Arndilly He was called upon in his turn at
a large party and having nothing to aid him in an exercise to which
he was new save the example of his predecessors lifted his glass after
much writhing and groaning and gave The reflection of the moon in the
cawm bosom of the lake

At this moment Lady Baird glanced at me and we all rose to go into the
drawingroom but on the way from my chair to the door whither the earl
escorted me he said gallantly I suppose the men in your country
do not take champagne at dinner I cannot fancy their craving it when
dining beside an American woman

That was charming though he did pay my country a compliment at my
expense One likes of course to have the type recognised as fine at
the same time his remark would have been more flattering if it had been
less sweeping

When I remember that he offered me his ancestors asked me to drive two
hundred and eighty miles and likened me to champagne I feel that
with my heart already occupied and my hand promised I could hardly have
accomplished more in the course of a single dinnerhour



Chapter VII Francesca meets th unconquerd Scot



Francescas experiences were not so fortunate indeed I have never seen
her more out of sorts than she was during our long chat over the fire
after our return to Breadalbane Terrace

How did you get on with your delightful minister inquired Salemina
of the young lady as she flung her unoffending wrap over the back of a
chair He was quite the handsomest man in the room who is he

He is the Reverend Ronald Macdonald and the most disagreeable
condescending illtempered prig I ever met

Why Francesca I exclaimed Lady Baird speaks of him as her
favourite nephew and says he is full of charm

He is just as full of charm as he was when I met him returned the
girl nonchalantly that is he parted with none of it this evening
He was incorrigibly stiff and rude and oh so Scotch I believe if one
punctured him with a hatpin oatmeal would fly into the air

Doubtless you acquainted him early in the evening with the
immeasurable advantages of our sleepingcar system the superiority of
our fastrunning elevators and the height of our buildings observed
Salemina

I mentioned them Francesca answered evasively

You naturally inveighed against the Scotch climate

Oh I alluded to it but only when he said that our hot summers must be
insufferable

I suppose you repeated the remark you made at luncheon that the ladies
you had seen in Princes Street were excessively plain

Yes I did she replied hotly but that was because he said that
American girls generally looked bloodless and frail He asked if it
were really true that they ate chalk and slate pencils Wasnt that
unendurable I answered that those were the chief solid article of food
but that after their complexions were established so to speak their
parents often allowed them pickles and native claret to vary the diet

What did he say to that I asked

Oh he said Quite so quite so that was his invariable response to
all my witticisms Then when I told him casually that the shops looked
very small and dark and stuffy here and that there were not as many
tartans and plaids in the windows as we had expected he remarked
that as to the latter point the American season had not opened yet
Presently he asserted that no royal city in Europe could boast ten
centuries of such glorious and stirring history as Edinburgh I said it
did not appear to be stirring much at present and that everything in
Scotland seemed a little slow to an American that he could have no idea
of push or enterprise until he visited a city like Chicago He retorted
that happily Edinburgh was peculiarly free from the taint of the
ledger and the countinghouse that it was Weimar without a Goethe
Boston without its twang

Incredible cried Salemina deeply wounded in her local pride He
never could have said twang unless you had tried him beyond measure

I dare say I did he is easily tried returned Francesca I asked
him sarcastically if he had ever been in Boston No he said it is
not necessary to GO there And while we are discussing these matters
he went on how is your American dyspepsia these dayshave you
decided what is the cause of it

Yes we have said I as quick as a flash we have always taken in
more foreigners than we could assimilate I wanted to tell him that one
Scotsman of his type would upset the national digestion anywhere but I
restrained myself

I am glad you did restrain yourselfonce exclaimed Salemina What
a tactful person the Reverend Ronald must be if you have reported
him faithfully Why didnt you give him up and turn to your other
neighbour

I did as soon as I could with courtesy but the man on my left was the
type that always haunts me at dinners if the hostess hasnt one on her
visitinglist she imports one for the occasion He asked me at once of
what material the Brooklyn Bridge is made I told him I really didnt
know Why should I I seldom go over it Then he asked me whether it was
a suspension bridge or a cantilever Of course I didnt know I am not
an engineer

You are so tactlessly needlessly candid I expostulated Why didnt
you say boldly that the Brooklyn Bridge is a wooden cantilever with
guttapercha braces He didnt know or he wouldnt have asked you He
couldnt find out until he reached home and you would never have
seen him again and if you had and he had taunted you you could have
laughed vivaciously and said you were chaffing That is my method and
it is the only way to preserve life in a foreign country Even my
earl who did not thirst for information fortunately asked me the
population of the Yellowstone Park and I simply told him three hundred
thousand at a venture

That would never have satisfied my neighbour said Francesca Finding
me in such a lamentable state of ignorance he explained the principle
of his own stupid Forth Bridge to me When I said I understood
perfectly just to get into shallower water where we wouldnt need any
bridge the Reverend Ronald joined in the conversation and asked me to
repeat the explanation to him Naturally I couldnt and he knew that I
couldnt when he asked me so the bridge man I dont know his name
and dont care to know it drew a diagram of the national idol on his
dinnercard and gave a dull and elaborate lecture upon it Here is the
card and now that three hours have intervened I cannot tell which way
to turn the drawing so as to make the bridge right side up if there
is anything puzzling in the world it is these architectural plans and
diagrams I am going to pin it to the wall and ask the Reverend Ronald
which way it goes

Do you mean that he will call upon us we cried in concert

He asked if he might come and continue our stimulating conversation
and as Lady Baird was standing by I could hardly say no I am sure of
one thing that before I finish with him I will widen his horizon so
that he will be able to see something beside Scotland and his little
insignificant Fifeshire parish I told him our country parishes in
America were ten times as large as his He said he had heard that they
covered a good deal of territory and that the ministers salaries were
sometimes paid in pork and potatoes That shows you the style of his
retorts

I really cannot decide which of you was the more disagreeable said
Salemina if he calls I shall not remain in the room

I wouldnt gratify him by staying out retorted Francesca He is
extremely good for the circulation I think I was never so warm in my
life as when I talked with him as physical exercise he is equal to
bicycling The bridge man is coming to call too I made him a diagram
of Breadalbane Terrace and a plan of the hall and staircase on my
dinnercard He was distinctly ungrateful in fact he remarked that he
had been born in this very house but would not trust himself to find
his way upstairs with my plan as a guide He also said the American
vocabulary was vastly amusing so picturesque unstudied and fresh

That was nice surely I interpolated

You know perfectly well that it was an insult

Francesca is very like that young man laughed Salemina who
whenever he engaged in controversy seemed to take off his flesh and sit
in his nerves

Im not supersensitive replied Francesca but when ones vocabulary
is called picturesque by a Britisher one always knows he is thinking of
cowboys and broncos However I shifted the weight into the other scale
by answering Thank you And your phraseology is just as unusual to
us Indeed he said with some surprise I supposed our method of
expression very sedate and uneventful Not at all I returned when
you say as you did a moment ago that you never eat potato to your
fish But I do not he urged obtusely Very likely I argued but
the fact is not of so much importance as the preposition Now I eat
potato WITH my fish You make a mistake he said and we both laughed
in spite of ourselves while he murmured eating potato WITH fishhow
extraordinary Well the bridge man may not add perceptibly to the
gaiety of the nations but he is better than the Reverend Ronald I
forgot to say that when I chanced to be speaking of doughnuts that
unconquerd Scot asked me if a doughnut resembled a peanut Can you
conceive such ignorance

I think you were not only aggressively American but painfully
provincial said Salemina with some warmth Why in the world should
you drag doughnuts into a dinnertable conversation in Edinburgh Why
not select topics of universal interest

Like the Currie Brig or the shade of Montrose I murmured slyly

To one who has ever eaten a doughnut the subject is of transcendent
interest and as for one who has notwell he should be made to feel
his limitations replied Francesca with a yawn Come let us forget
our troubles in sleep it is after midnight

About half an hour later she came to my bedside her dark hair hanging
over her white gown her eyes still bright

Penelope she said softly I did not dare tell Salemina and I should
not confess it to you save that I am afraid Lady Baird will complain of
me but I was dreadfully rude to the Reverend Ronald I couldnt help
it he roused my worst passions It all began with his saying he
thought international marriages presented even more difficulties to the
imagination than the other kind I hadnt said anything about marriages
nor thought anything about marriages of any sort but I told him
INSTANTLY I considered that every international marriage involved
two national suicides He said that he shouldnt have put it quite so
forcibly but that he hadnt given much thought to the subject I said
that I had and I thought we had gone on long enough filling the coffers
of the British nobility with American gold

FRANCES I interrupted Dont tell me that you made that vulgar
cheap newspaper assertion

I did she replied stoutly and at the moment I only wished I could
make it stronger If there had been anything cheaper or more vulgar I
should have said it but of course there isnt Then he remarked that
the British nobility merited and needed all the support it could get in
these hard times and asked if we had not cherished some intention in
the States lately of bestowing it in greenbacks instead of gold I
threw all manners to the winds after that and told him that there were
no husbands in the world like American men and that foreigners never
seemed to have any proper consideration for women Now were my remarks
any worse than his after all and what shall I do about it anyway

You should go to bed first I murmured sleepily and if you ever have
an opportunity to make amends which I doubt you should devote yourself
to showing the Reverend Ronald the breadth of your own horizon instead
of trying so hard to broaden his As you are extremely pretty you may
possibly succeed man is human and I dare say in a month you will
be advising him to love somebody more worthy than yourself He could
easily do it Now dont kiss me again for I am displeased with you I
hate international bickering

So do I agreed Francesca virtuously as she plaited her hair and
there is no spectacle so abhorrent to every sense as a narrowminded man
who cannot see anything outside of his own country But he is awfully
goodlookingI will say that for him and if you dont explain me to
Lady Baird I will write to Mr Beresford about the earl There was
no bickering there it was looking at you two that made us think of
international marriages

It must have suggested to you that speech about filling the coffers of
the British nobility I replied sarcastically inasmuch as the earl
has twenty thousand pounds a year probably and I could barely buy two
gold hairpins to pin on the coronet There do go away and leave me in
peace

Good night again then she said as she rose reluctantly from the
foot of the bed I doubt if I can sleep for thinking what a pity it
is that such an egotistic bumptious pugnacious prejudiced insular
bigoted person should be so handsome And who wants to marry him any
way that he should be so distressed about international alliances
One would think that all female America was sighing to lead him to the
altar



Chapter VIII What made th Assembly shine



Two or three days ago we noted an unusual though subdued air of
excitement at 22 Breadalbane Terrace where for a week we had been
the sole lodgers Mrs Menzies whom we call Mingess has returned
to Kilconquhar which she calls Kinyuchar Miss CockburnSinclair has
purchased her wedding outfit and gone back to Inverness where she
will be greeted as CoburnSinkler the HepburnSciennes will be leaving
tomorrow just as we have learned to pronounce their names and the
sound of the scrubbingbrush is heard in the land In corners where all
was clean and spotless before Mrs MCollop is digging with the broom
and the maiden Boots is following her with a damp cloth The stair
carpets are hanging on lines in the back garden and Susanna with her
cap rakishly on one side is always to be seen polishing the stairrods
Whenever we traverse the halls we are obliged to leap over pails of
suds and Miss DiggityDalgety has given us two dinners which bore a
curious resemblance to washingday repasts in suburban America

Is it spring housecleaning I ask Mistress MCollop

Na na she replies hurriedly its the meenisters

On the 19th of May we are a maiden castle no longer Black coats and
hats ring at the bell and pass in and out of the different apartments
The hall table is sprinkled with letters visitingcards and programmes
which seem to have had the alphabet shaken out upon them for they bear
the names of professors doctors reverends and very reverends and
fairly bristle with AMs MAs ABs DDs and LLDs The
voice of family prayer is lifted up from the diningroom floor and
paraphrases and hymns float down the stairs from above Their Graces the
Lord High Commissioner and the Marchioness of Heatherdale will arrive
today at Holyrood Palace there to reside during the sittings of the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and tomorrow the Royal
Standard will be hoisted at Edinburgh Castle from reveille to retreat
His Grace will hold a levee at eleven Directly His Grace leaves
the palace after the levee the guard of honour will proceed by the
Canongate to receive him on his arrival at St Giles Church and will
then proceed to Assembly Hall to receive him on his arrival there The
Sixth Inniskilling Dragoons and the First Battalion Royal Scots will
be in attendance and there will be Unicorns Carricks pursuivants
heralds macebearers ushers and pages together with the
Pursebearer and the Lyon KingofArms and the national anthem and
the royal salute for the palace has awakened and is mimicking its
past

Should the weather be wet the troops will be cloaked at the discretion
of the commanding officer They print this instruction as a matter of
form and of course every man has his macintosh ready The only hope
lies in the fact that this is a national function and Queens weather
is a possibility The one personage for whom the Scottish climate will
occasionally relax is Her Majesty Queen Victoria who for sixty years
has exerted a benign influence on British skies and at least secured
sunshine on great parade days Such women are all too few

In this wise enters His Grace the Lord High Commissioner to open the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and on the same day there
arrives by the railway but travelling first class the Moderator of
the Church of Scotland Free to convene its separate supreme Courts
in Edinburgh He will have no Union Jacks Royal Standards Dragoons
bands or pipers he will bear his own purse and stay at an hotel but
when the final procession of all comes he will probably march beside
His Grace the Lord High Commissioner and they will talk together not
of deadandgone kingdoms but of the one at hand where there are
no more divisions in the ranks and where all the soldiers are simply
kings men marching to victory under the inspiration of a common
watchword

It is a matter of regret to us that the UPs the third branch of
Scottish Presbyterianism could not be holding an Assembly during this
same week so that we might the more easily decide in which flock we
really belong 22 Breadalbane Terrace now represents all shades of
religious opinion within the bounds of Presbyterianism We have an
Elder a Professor of Biblical Criticism a Majestys Chaplain and even
an exModerator under our roof and they are equally divided between the
Free and the Established bodies

Mrs MCollop herself is a pillar of the Free Kirk but she has no
prejudice in lodgers and says so long as she maks her rent she doesna
care aboot their releegious principles Miss DiggityDalgety is the
sole representative of United Presbyterianism in the household and she
is somewhat gloomy in Assembly time To belong to a dissenting body and
yet to cook early and late for the purpose of fattening ones religious
rivals is doubtless trying to the temper and then she asserts that
meenisters are aye tume empty

You must put away your Scottish ballads and histories now Salemina
and keep your Concordance and your umbrella constantly at hand

This I said as we stood on George IV Bridge and saw the ministers
glooming down from the Mound in a dense Assembly fog As the presence
of any considerable number of priests on an ocean steamer is supposed
to bring rough weather so the addition of a few hundred parsons to the
population of Edinburgh is believed to induce rainor perhaps I should
say more rain

Of course when one is in perfect bodily health one can more readily
resist the infection of disease Similarly if Scottish skies were not
ready and longing to pour out rain were not ignobly weak in holding it
back they would not be so susceptible to the depressing influences of
visiting ministers This is Francescas theory as stated to the Reverend
Ronald who was holding an umbrella over her ungrateful head at the
time and she went on to boast of a convention she once attended in
California where twentysix thousand Christian Endeavourers were unable
to dim the American sunshine though they stayed ten days

Our first duty both to ourselves and to the community I continued to
Salemina is to learn how there can be three distinct kinds of proper
Presbyterianism Perhaps it would be a graceful act on our part if we
should each espouse a different kind then there would be no feeling
among our Edinburgh friends And again what is this union of which we
hear murmurs Is it religious or political Is it an echo of the
1707 Union you explained to us last week or is it a new one What is
Disestablishment What is Disruption Are they the same thing What is
the Sustentation Fund What was the NonIntrusion party What was the
Dundas Despotism What is the argument at present going on about taking
the Shorter Catechism out of the schools What is the Shorter Catechism
any wayor at least what have they left out of the Longer Catechism to
make it shorterand is the length of the Catechism one of the points
of difference then when we have looked up Chalmers and Candlish we
can ask the exModerator and the Professor of Biblical Criticism to tea
separately of course lest there should be ecclesiastical quarrels

Salemina and Francesca both incline to the Established church I lean
instinctively toward the Free but that does not mean that we have
any knowledge of the differences that separate them Salemina is a
conservative in all things she loves law order historic associations
old customs and so when there is a regularly established national
churchor for that matter a regularly established anything
she gravitates to it by the law of her being Francescas religious
convictions when she is away from her own minister and native land are
inclined to be flexible The church that enters Edinburgh with a marquis
and a marchioness representing the Crown the church that opens its
Assembly with splendid processions and dignified pageants the church
that dispenses generous hospitality from Holyrood Palaceabove all
the church that escorts its Lord High Commissioner from place to place
with bands and pipersthat is the church to which she pledges her
constant presence and enthusiastic support

As for me I believe I am a born protestant or comeouter as they
used to call dissenters in the early days of New England I have not yet
had time to study the question but as I lack all knowledge of the other
two branches of Presbyterianism I am enabled to say unhesitatingly that
I belong to the Free Kirk To begin with the very word free has
a fascination for the citizen of a republic and then my theological
training was begun this morning by a gifted young minister of Edinburgh
whom we call the Friar because the first time we saw him in his gown
and bands the little spot of sheer whiteness beneath the chin that
lends such added spirituality to a spiritual face we fancied that
he looked like some pale brother of the Church in the olden time His
pallor in a land of rosy redness and milky whiteness his smooth fair
hair which in the light from the stainedglass window above the pulpit
looked reddish gold the Southern heat of passionate conviction that
coloured his slow Northern speech the remoteness of his personality
the weariness of his deepset eyes that bespoke such fastings and
vigils as he probably never practisedall this led to our choice of
the name

As we walked toward St Andrews Church and Tanfield Hall where he
insisted on taking me to get the proper historical background he told
me about the great Disruption movement He was extremely eloquentso
eloquent that the image of Willie Beresford tottered continually on its
throne and I found not the slightest difficulty in giving an unswerving
allegiance to the principles presented by such an orator

We went first to St Andrews where the General Assembly met in
1843 and where the famous exodus of the Free Protesting Church took
placeone of the most important events in the modern history of the
United Kingdom

The movement was promoted by the great Dr Chalmers and his party
mainly to abolish the patronage of livings then in the hands of certain
heritors or patrons who might appoint any minister they wished without
consulting the congregation Needless to say as a freeborn American
citizen and never having had a heritor in the family my blood easily
boiled at the recital of such tyranny In 1834 the Church had passed a
law of its own it seems ordaining that no presentee to a parish should
be admitted if opposed by the majority of the male communicants That
would have been well enough could the State have been made to agree
though I should have gone further personally and allowed the female
communicants to have some voice in the matter

The Friar took me into a particularly chilly historic corner and
leaning against a damp stone pillar painted the scene in St Andrews
when the Assembly met in the presence of a great body of spectators
while a vast throng gathered without breathlessly awaiting the result
No one believed that any large number of ministers would relinquish
livings and stipends and cast their bread upon the waters for what many
thought a fantastic principle Yet when the Moderator left his
place after reading a formal protest signed by one hundred and twenty
ministers and seventytwo elders he was followed first by Dr Chalmers
and then by four hundred and seventy men who marched in a body to
Tanfield Hall where they formed themselves into the General Assembly
of the Free Church of Scotland When Lord Jeffrey was told of it an
hour later he exclaimed Thank God for Scotland there is not another
country on earth where such a deed could be done And the Friar
reminded me proudly of Macaulays saying that the Scots had made
sacrifices for the sake of religious opinion for which there was no
parallel in the annals of England On the next Sunday after these
remarkable scenes in Edinburgh there were heartbreaking farewells
so the Friar said in many village parishes when the minister in
dismissing his congregation told them that he had ceased to belong to
the Established Church and would neither preach nor pray in that pulpit
again that he had joined the Free Protesting Church of Scotland and
God willing would speak the next Sabbath morning at the manse door to
as many as cared to follow him What affecting leavetakings there must
have been the Friar exclaimed When my grandfather left his church
that May morning only fifteen members remained behind and he could
hear the more courageous say to the timid ones Tak your Bible and
come awa mon Was not all this a splendid testimony to the power
of principle and the sacred demands of conscience I said Yea most
heartily for the spirit of Jenny Geddes stirred within me that morning
and under the spell of the Friars kindling eye and eloquent voice I
positively gloried in the valiant achievements of the Free Church
It would always be easier for a woman to say Yea than Nay to the
Friar When he left me in Breadalbane Terrace I was at heart a member of
his congregation in good and irregular standing ready to teach in
his Sundayschool sing in his choir visit his aged and sick poor
and especially to stand between him and a too admiring feminine
constituency

When I entered the drawingroom I found that Salemina had just enjoyed
an hours conversation with the exModerator of the opposite church
wing

Oh my dear she sighed you have missed such a treat You have
no conception of these Scottish ministers of the Establishmentsuch
culture such courtliness of manner such scholarship such
spirituality such wise benignity of opinion I asked the doctor to
explain the Disruption movement to me and he was most interesting and
lucid and most affecting too when he described the misunderstandings
and misconceptions that the Church suffered in those terrible days of
1843 when its very lifeblood as well as its integrity and unity were
threatened by the foes in its own household when breaches of faith and
trust occurred on all sides and dissents and disloyalties shook it to
its very foundation You see Penelope I have never fully understood
the disagreements about heritors and livings and state control before
but here is the whole matter in a nutsh

My dear Salemina I interposed with dignity you will pardon me
I am sure when I tell you that any discussion on this point would be
intensely painful to me as I now belong to the Free Kirk

Where have you been this morning she asked with a piercing glance

To St Andrews and Tanfield Hall

With whom

With the Friar

I see Happy the missionary to whom you incline your ear
FIRSTwhich I thought rather inconsistent of Salemina as she had
been converted by precisely the same methods and in precisely the same
length of time as had I the only difference being in the ages of our
respective missionaries one being about fiveandthirty and other
fiveandsixty Even this is to my credit after all for if one can
be persuaded so quickly and fully by a young and comparatively
inexperienced man it shows that one must be extremely susceptible to
spiritual influences orsomething



Chapter IX Omnia presbyteria est divisa in partes tres



Religion in Edinburgh is a theory a convention a fashion both humble
and aristocratic a sensation an intellectual conviction an emotion
a dissipation a sweet habit of the blood in fact it is it seems to
me every sort of thing it can be to the human spirit

When we had finished our church toilettes and came into the
drawingroom on the first Sunday morning I remember that we found
Francesca at the window

There is a battle murder or sudden death going on in the square
below she said I am going to ask Susanna to ask Mrs MCollop what
it means Never have I seen such a crowd moving peacefully with no
excitement or confusion in one direction Where can the people be
going Do you suppose it is a fire Why I believe it cannot be
possible yes they certainly are disappearing in that big church on
the corner and millions simply millions and trillions are coming in
the other directiontoward St Knoxs

Impressive as was this morning churchgoing a still greater surprise
awaited us at seven oclock in the evening when the crowd blocked the
streets on two sides of a church near Breadalbane Terrace and though
it was quite ten minutes before service when we entered Salemina and I
only secured the last two seats in the aisle and Francesca was obliged
to sit on the steps of the pulpit or seek a sermon elsewhere

It amused me greatly to see Francesca sitting on pulpit steps her Paris
gown and smart toque in close juxtaposition to the rusty bonnet and
bombazine dress of a respectable elderly tradeswoman The church
officer entered first bearing the great Bible and hymnbook which he
reverently placed on the pulpit cushions and close behind him to
our entire astonishment came the Reverend Ronald Macdonald evidently
exchanging with the regular minister of the parish whom we had come
especially to hear I pitied Francescas confusion and embarrassment
but I was too far from her to offer an exchange of seats and through
the long service she sat there at the feet of her foe so near that
she could have touched the hem of his gown as he knelt devoutly for his
first silent prayer

Perhaps she was thinking of her last interview with him when she
descanted at length on that superfluity of naughtiness and Biblical
pedantry which she asserted made Scottish ministers preach from
outoftheway texts

I have never been able to find my place in the Bible since I arrived
she complained to Salemina when she was quite sure that Mr Macdonald
was listening to her and this he generally was in my opinion no
matter who chanced to be talking What with their skipping and hopping
about from Haggai to Philemon Habakkuk to Jude and Micah to Titus in
their readings and then settling on seventh Nahum sixth Zephaniah
or second Calathumpians for the sermon I do nothing but search the
Scriptures in the Edinburgh churchessearch search search until
some Christian by my side or in the pew behind me notices my hapless
plight and hands me a Bible opened at the text Last Sunday it was
Obadiah first fifteenth For the day of the Lord is near upon all the
heathen It chanced to be a returned missionary who was preaching on
that occasion but the Bible is full of heathen and why need he have
chosen a text from Obadiah poor little Obadiah one page long slipped
in between Amos and Jonah where nobody but an elder could find him
If Francesca had not seen with wicked delight the Reverend Ronalds
expression of anxiety she would never have spoken of second
Calathumpians but of course he has no means of knowing how unlike
herself she is when in his company


To go back to our first Sunday worship in Edinburgh The church officer
closed the door of the pulpit on the Reverend Ronald and I thought I
heard the clicking of a lock at all events he returned at the close of
the services to liberate him and escort him back to the vestry for the
entrances and exits of this beadle or ministers man as the church
officer is called in the country districts form an impressive part
of the ceremonies If he did lock the minister into the pulpit it is
probably only another national custom like the occasional locking in
of the passengers in a railway train and may be positively necessary in
the case of such magnetic and popular preachers as Mr Macdonald or the
Friar

I have never seen such attention such concentration as in these great
congregations of the Edinburgh churches As nearly as I can judge it
is intellectual rather than emotional but it is not a tribute paid to
eloquence alone it is habitual and universal and is yielded loyally to
insufferable dulness when occasion demands

When the text is announced there is an indescribable rhythmic movement
forward followed by a concerted rustle of Bible leaves not the rustle
of a few Bibles in a few pious pews but the rustle of all of them in
all the pewsand there are more Bibles in an Edinburgh Presbyterian
church than one ever sees anywhere else unless it be in the warehouses
of the Bible Societies

The text is read twice clearly and another rhythmic movement follows
when the books are replaced on the shelves Then there is a delightful
settling back of the entire congregation a snuggling comfortably into
corners and a fitting of shoulders to the pewsnot to sleep however
an older generation may have done that under the strain of a twohour
wearifu dreich sermon but these churchgoers are not to be caught
napping They wear on the contrary a keen expectant critical look
which must be inexpressibly encouraging to the minister if he has
anything to say If he has not and this is a possibility in Edinburgh
as it is everywhere else then I am sure it is wisdom for the beadle to
lock him in lest he flee when he meets those searching eyes

The Edinburgh sermon though doubtless softened in outline in these
later years is still a more carefully built discourse than one
ordinarily hears out of Scotland being constructed on conventional
lines of doctrine exposition logical inference and practical
application Though modern preachers do not announce the division of
their subject into heads and subheads firstlies and secondlies and
finallies my brethren there seems to be the old framework underneath
the sermon and every one recognises it as moving silently below the
surface at least I always fancy that as the minister finishes one
point and attacks another the younger folk fix their eagle eyes on him
afresh and the whole congregation sits up straighter and listens more
intently as if making mental notes They do not listen so much as if
they were enthralled though they often are and have good reason to be
but as if they were to pass an examination on the subject afterwards
and I have no doubt that this is the fact

The prayers are many and are divided apparently like those of the
liturgies into petitions confessions and aspirations not forgetting
the allembracing one with which we are perfectly familiar in our native
land in which the preacher commends to the Fatherly care every
animate and inanimate thing not mentioned specifically in the foregoing
supplications It was in the middle of this compendious petition the
lang prayer that rheumatic old Scottish dames used to make a practice
of cheengin the fit as they stood devoutly through it When the
meenister comes to the ingetherin o the Gentiles I ken weel its
time to cheenge legs for then the prayer is jist half dune said a
good sermontaster of Fife

The organ is finding its way rapidly into the Scottish kirks how can
the shade of John Knox endure a kist o whistles in good St Giles
but it is not used yet in some of those we attend most frequently
There is a certain quaint solemnity a beautiful austerity in the
unaccompanied singing of hymns that touches me profoundly I am often
carried very high on the waves of splendid church music when the
organs thunder rolls through vaulted aisles and the angelic voices
of a trained choir chant the aspirations of my soul for me and when
an Edinburgh congregation stands and the precentor leads in that noble
paraphrase

 God of our fathers be the God
 Of their succeeding race

there is a certain ascetic fervour in it that seems to me the perfection
of worship It may be that my Puritan ancestors are mainly responsible
for this feeling or perhaps my recently adopted Jenny Geddes is
a factor in it of course if she were in the habit of flinging
fauldstules at Deans she was probably the friend of truth and the foe
of beauty so far as it was in her power to separate them

There is no music during the offertory in these churches and this too
pleases my sense of the fitness of things It cannot soften the woe
of the people who are disinclined to the giving away of money and the
cheerful givers need no encouragement For my part I like to sit quite
undistracted by soprano solos and listen to the refined tinkle of
the sixpences and shillings and the vulgar chink of the pennies and
hapennies in the contributionboxes Country ministers I am told
develop such an acute sense of hearing that they can estimate the amount
of the collection before it is counted There is often a huge pewter
plate just within the church door in which the offerings are placed as
the worshippers enter or leave and one always notes the preponderance
of silver at the morning and of copper at the evening services It is
perhaps needless to say that before Francesca had been in Edinburgh
a fortnight she asked Mr Macdonald if it were true that the Scots
continued coining the farthing for years and years merely to have a
piece of money serviceable for church offerings

As to social differences in the congregations we are somewhat at sea
We tried to arrive at a conclusion by the hats and bonnets than
which there is usually no more infallible test On our first Sunday
we attended the Free Kirk in the morning and the Established in the
evening The bonnets of the Free Kirk were so much the more elegant that
we said to one another This is evidently the church of society though
the adjective Free should by rights attract the masses On the
second Sunday we reversed the order of things and found the Established
bonnets much finer than the Free bonnets which was a source of
mystification to us until we discovered that it was a question of
morning or evening service not of the form of Presbyterianism We
think on the whole that taking town and country congregations
together millinery has not flourished under Presbyterianismit seems
to thrive better in the Romish atmosphere of France but the Disruption
at least has had nothing to answer for in the matter as it appears
simply to have parted the bonnets of Scotland in twain as Moses divided
the Red Sea and left good and evil on both sides

I can never forget our first military service at St Giles We left
Breadalbane Terrace before nine in the morning and walked along the
beautiful curve of street that sweeps around the base of the Castle
Rockwalked on through the poverty and squalor of the High Street
keeping in view the beautiful lantern tower as a guidingstar till we
heard

 The murmur of the city crowd
 And from his steeple jingling loud
 St Giless mingling din

We joined the throng outside the venerable church and awaited the
approach of the soldiers from the Castle paradeground for it is
from there they march in detachments to the church of their choice A
religion they must have and if when called up and questioned about it
they have forgotten to provide themselves or have no preference as to
form of worship they are assigned to one by the person in authority
When the regiments are assembled on the paradeground of a Sunday
morning the first command is Church of Scotland right about face
quick marchthe bodies of men belonging to other denominations
standing fast until their turn comes to move It is said that a new
officer once gave the command Church of Scotland right about face
quick march Fancy releegions stay where ye are

Just as we were being told this story by an attendant squire there was
a burst of scarlet and a blare of music and down Castlehill and the
Lawnmarket into Parliament Square marched hundreds of redcoats the
Highland pipers otherwise the Olympian gods swinging in front leaving
the American female heart prostrate beneath their victorious tread The
strains of music that in the distance sounded so martial and triumphant
we recognised in a moment as Abide with me and never did the fine
old tune seem more majestic than when it marked a measure for the steady
tramp tramp tramp of those soldierly feet As The March of the
Cameron Men piped from the green steeps of Castlehill had aroused in
us thoughts of splendid victories on the battlefield so did this simple
hymn awake the spirit of the church militant a no less stern but more
spiritual soldiership in which the fruit of righteousness is sown in
peace of them that make peace

As I fell asleep on that first Sunday night in Edinburgh after the
somewhat unusual experience of three church services in a single day
three separate notes of memory floated in and out of the fabric of my
dreams the sound of the soldiers feet marching into old St Giles to
the strains of Abide with me the voice of the Reverend Ronald
ringing out with manly insistence It is aspiration that counts not
realisation pursuit not achievement quest not conquestand the
closing phrases of the Friars prayer When Christ has forgiven us
help us to forgive ourselves Help us to forgive ourselves so fully
that we can even forget ourselves remembering only Him And so let His
kingdom come we ask it for the Kings sake Amen



Chapter X Mrs MCollop as a sermontaster



Even at this time of Assemblies when the atmosphere is almost
exclusively clerical and ecclesiastical the two great church armies
represented here certainly conceal from the casual observer all
rivalries and jealousies if indeed they cherish any As for the two
dissenting bodies the Church of the Disruption and the Church of the
Secession have been keeping company so to speak for some years with
a distant eye to an eventual union In the light of all this pleasant
toleration it seems difficult to realise that earlier Edinburgh where
we learned from old parochial records of 1605 Margaret Sinclair was
cited by the Session of the Kirk for being at the Burne for water on
the Sabbath that Janet Merling was ordered to make public repentance
for concealing a bairn unbaptized in her house for the space of twenty
weeks and calling said bairn Janet that Pat Richardson had to crave
mercy for being found in his boat in time of afternoon service and that
Janet Walker accused of having visitors in her house in sermontime
had to confess her offence and on her knees crave mercy of God AND the
Kirk Session which no doubt was much worse under penalty of a hundred
pounds Scots Possibly there are people yet who would prefer to pay a
hundred pounds rather than hear a sermon but they are few

It was in the early seventeen hundred and thirties when Allan Ramsay
in fear and trembling of legal and clerical censure lent out the
plays of Congreve and Farquhar from his famous High Street library In
1756 it was that the Presbytery of Edinburgh suspended all clergymen
who had witnessed the representation of Douglas that virtuous tragedy
written to the dismay of all Scotland by a minister of the Kirk That
the world even the theological world moves with tolerable rapidity
when once set in motion is evinced by the fact that on Mrs Siddons
second engagement in Edinburgh in the summer of 1785 vast crowds
gathered about the doors of the theatre not at night alone but in the
day to secure places It became necessary to admit them first at three
in the afternoon and then at noon and eventually the General Assembly
of the Church then in session was compelled to arrange its meetings with
reference to the appearance of the great actress How one would have
enjoyed hearing that Scotsman say after one of her most splendid
flights of tragic passion Thats no bad We have read of her dismay
at this ludicrous parsimony of praise but her selfrespect must have
been restored when the Edinburgh ladies fainted by dozens during her
impersonation of Isabella in The Fatal Marriage

Since Scottish hospitality is wellnigh inexhaustible it is not
strange that from the moment Edinburgh streets began to be crowded
with ministers our drawingroom table began to bear shoals of engraved
invitations of every conceivable sort all equally unfamiliar to our
American eyes

The PurseBearer is commanded by the Lord High Commissioner and the
Marchioness of Heatherdale to invite Miss Hamilton to a Garden Party at
the Palace of Holyrood House on the 27th of May WEATHER PERMITTING

The General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland admits Miss
Hamilton to any gallery on any day

The Marchioness of Heatherdale is At Home on the 26th of May from a
quarterpast nine in the evening Palace of Holyrood House

The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland is
At Home in the Library of the New College on Saturday the 22nd of May
from eight to ten in the evening

The Moderator asks the pleasure of Miss Hamiltons presence at a
Breakfast to be given on the morning of the 25th May at Dunedin Hotel

We determined to go to all these functions impartially tracking thus
the Presbyterian lion to his very lair and observing his home as well
as his company manners In everything that related to the distinctively
religious side of the proceedings we sought advice from Mrs MCollop
while we went to Lady Baird for definite information on secular matters
We also found an unexpected ally in the person of our own exModerators
niece Miss Jean Dalziel Deeyell She has been educated in Paris
but she must always have been a delightfully breezy person quite too
irrepressible to be affected by Scottish haar or theology Go to the
Assemblies by all means she said and be sure and get places for the
heresy case These are no longer what they once werewe are getting
lamentably weak and gelatinous in our beliefsbut there is an
unusually nice one this year the heretic is very young and handsome
and quite wicked as ministers go Dont fail to be presented at the
Marchionesss court at Holyrood for it is a capital preparation for the
ordeal of Her Majesty and Buckingham Palace Nothing fit to wear
You have never seen the people who go or you wouldnt say that I even
advise you to attend one of the breakfasts it cant do you any serious
or permanent injury so long as you eat something before you go Oh no
it doesnt matterwhichever one you choose you will cheerfully omit
the other for I avow as a Scottish spinster and the niece of an
exModerator that to a stranger and a foreigner the breakfasts are
worse than Arctic explorations If you do not chance to be at the table
of honour

The gifted Miss Hamilton is always at the table of honour unless she
is placed there she refuses to eat and then the universe rocks to its
centre interpolated Francesca impertinently

It is true continued Miss Dalziel you will often sit beside a
minister or a ministers wife who will make you scorn the sordid
appetites of flesh but if you do not then eat as little as may be and
flee up the Mound to whichever Assembly is the Mecca of your soul

My nieces tongue is an unruly member said the exModerator who was
present at this diatribe and the principal mistakes she makes in
her judgment of these clerical feasts is that she criticises them as
conventional repasts whereas they are intended to be informal meetings
together of people who wish to be better acquainted

Hot bacon and eggs would be no harm to friendship answered Miss
Dalziel with an affectionate moue

Cold bacon and eggs is better than cold piety said the exModerator
and it may be a good discipline for fastidious young ladies who have
been spoiled by Parisian breakfasts

It is to Mrs MCollop that we owe our chief insight into technical
church matters although we seldom agree with her opeenions after
we gain our own experience She never misses hearing one sermon on
a Sabbath and oftener she listens to two or three Neither does she
confine herself to the ministrations of a single preacher but roves
from one sanctuary to another seeking the bread of lifeoften
however according to her own account getting a particularly
indigestible stane

She is thus a complete guide to the Edinburgh pulpit and when she is
making a bed in the morning she dispenses criticism in so large and
impartial a manner that it would make the flesh of the meenistry
creep were it overheard I used to think Ian Maclarens sermontaster
a possible exaggeration of an existent type but I now see that she is
truth itself

Yell be tryin anither kirk the morn suggests Mrs MCollop
spreading the clean Sunday sheet over the mattress Wha did ye hear the
Sawbath thats bye Dr A Ay I ken him ower weel hes been there

Chapter XI Holyrood awakens



We were to make our bow to the Lord High Commissioner and the
Marchioness of Heatherdale in the evening and we were in a state of
republican excitement at 22 Breadalbane Terrace

Francesca had surprised us by refusing to be presented at this
semiroyal Scottish court Not I she said The Marchioness
represents the Queen we may discover when we arrive that she has
raised the standards of admission and requires us to back out of
the throneroom I dont propose to do that without London training
Besides I detest crowds and I never go to my own Presidents
receptions and I have a headache anyway and I dont feel like coping
with the Reverend Ronald tonight Lady Baird was to take us under her
wing and her nephew was to escort us Sir Robert being in Inveraray

Sally my dear I said as Francesca left the room with a bottle of
smellingsalts somewhat ostentatiously in evidence methinks the damsel
doth protest too much In other words she devotes a good deal of time
and discussion to a gentleman whom she heartily dislikes As she is
under your care I will direct your attention to the following points

Ronald Macdonald is a Scotsman Francesca disapproves of international
alliances

He is a Presbyterian she is a Swedenborgian

His father was a famous oldschool doctor Francesca is a
homoeopathist

He is serious Francesca is gay

I think under all the circumstances their acquaintance will bear
watching Two persons so utterly dissimilar and so far as superficial
observation goes so entirely unsuited to each other are quite likely
to drift into marriage unless diverted by watchful philanthropists

Nonsense returned Salemina brusquely You think because you are
under the spell of the tender passion yourself that other people are in
constant danger Francesca detests him

Who told you so

She herself triumphantly

Salemina I said pityingly I have always believed you a spinster
from choice dont lead me to think that you have never had any
experience in these matters The Reverend Ronald has also intimated to
me as plainly as he dared that he cannot bear the sight of Francesca
What do I gather from this statement The general conclusion that if it
be true it is curious that he looks at her incessantly

Francesca would never live in Scotland remarked Salemina feebly

Not unless she were asked of course I replied

He would never ask her

Not unless he thought he had a chance of an affirmative answer

Her father would never allow it

Her father allows what she permits him to allow You know that
perfectly well

What shall I do about it then

Consult me

What shall WE do about it

Let Nature have her own way

I dont believe in Nature

Dont be profane Salemina and dont be unromantic which is worse
but if you insist trust in Providence

I would rather trust Francescas hard heart

The hardest hearts melt if sufficient heat be applied Did I take you
to Newhaven and read you Christie Johnstone on the beach for nought
Dont you remember Charles Reade said that the Scotch are icebergs with
volcanoes underneath thaw the Scotch ice which is very cold and you
shall get to the Scotch fire warmer than any sun of Italy or Spain I
think Mr Macdonald is a volcano

I wish he were extinct said Salemina petulantly and I wish you
wouldnt make me nervous

If you had any faculty of premonition you wouldnt have waited for me
to make you nervous

Some people are singularly omniscient

Others are singularly deficient And at this moment Susanna Crum came
in to announce Miss Jean Dalziel who had come to see sights with us

It was our almost daily practice to walk through the Old Town and we
were now familiar with every street and close in that denselycrowded
quarter Our quest for the sites of ancient landmarks never grew
monotonous and we were always reconstructing in imagination the
Cowgate the Canongate the Lawnmarket and the High Street until we
could see Auld Reekie as it was in bygone centuries In those days of
continual war with England people crowded their dwellings as near the
Castle as possible so floor was piled upon floor and flat upon flat
families ensconcing themselves above other families the tendency
being ever skyward Those who dwelt on top had no desire to spend
their strength in carrying down the corkscrew stairs matter which would
descend by the force of gravity if pitched from the window or door so
the wayfarer especially after dusk would be greeted with cries of
Get oot o the gait or Gardy loo which was in the French Gardez
leau and which would have been understood in any language I fancy
after a little experience The streets then were filled with the debris
flung from a hundred upper windows while certain groundfloor tenants
such as butchers and candlemakers contributed their full share to the
fragrant heaps As for these too seldom used narrow turnpike stairs
imagine the dames of fashion tilting their vast hoops and silken
showpetticoats up and down in them

That swine roamed at will in these Elysian fields is to be presumed
since we have this amusing picture of three High Street belles and
beauties in the Traditions of Edinburgh

So easy were the manners of the great fabled to be so stiff and
decorous says the author that Lady Maxwells daughter Jane who
afterward became the Duchess of Gordon was seen riding a sow up the
High Street while her sister Eglantine afterwards Lady Wallace of
Craigie thumped lustily behind with a stick

No wonder in view of all this that King James VI when about to bring
home his darrest spous Anne of Denmark wrote to the Provost For
Gods sake see a things are richt at our hamecoming a king with a
newmarried wife doesna come hame ilka day

Had it not been for these royal homecomings and visits of distinguished
foreigners now and again aided by something still more salutary an
occasional outbreak of the plague the easygoing authorities would
never have issued any cleaning edicts and the still easiergoing
inhabitants would never have obeyed them It was these dark tortuous
wynds and closes nevertheless that made up the Court End of Old
Edinbro for some one writes in 1530 Via vaccarum in qua habitant
patricii et senatores urbis The nobility and chief senators of the
city dwell in the Cowgate And as for the Canongate this Saxon gaet
or way of the Holy rood canons it still sheltered in 1753 two dukes
sixteen earls two dowager countesses seven lords seven lords of
session thirteen baronets four commanders of the forces in Scotland
and five eminent menfine game indeed for Mally Lee

 A doun alang the Canongate
 Were beaux o ilk degree
 And mony ane turned round to look
 At bonny Mally Lee
 And were a gaun east an west
 Were a gaun agee
 Were a gaun east an west
 Courtin Mally Lee

Every corner bristles with memories Here is the Stamp Office Close
from which the lovely Susanna Countess of Eglinton was wont to issue
on assembly nights she six feet in height with a brilliantly fair
complexion and a face of the maist bewitching loveliness Her seven
daughters and stepdaughters were all conspicuously handsome and it
was deemed a goodly sight to watch the long procession of eight gilded
sedanchairs pass from the Stamp Office Close bearing her and her
stately brood to the Assembly Room amid a crowd that was hushed with
respect and admiration to behold their lofty and graceful figures step
from the chairs on the pavement

Here itself is the site of those old assemblies presided over at one
time by the famous Miss Nicky Murray a directress of society affairs
who seems to have been a feminine premonition of Count dOrsay and our
own MAllister Rather dull they must have been those old Scotch
balls where Goldsmith saw the ladies and gentlemen in two dismal groups
divided by the length of the room

 The Assembly Close received the fair
 Order and elegance presided there
 Each gay Right Honourable had her place
 To walk a minuet with becoming grace
 No racing to the dance with rival hurry
 Such was thy sway O famed Miss Nicky Murray

It was halfpast nine in the evening when Salemina and I drove to
Holyrood our humble cabhorse jogging faithfully behind Lady Bairds
brougham and it was the new experience of seeing Auld Reekie by
lamplight that called up these gay visions of other daysvisions and
days so thoroughly our mental property that we could not help resenting
the fact that women were hanging washing from the Countess of Eglintons
former windows and popping their unkempt heads out of the Duchess of
Gordons old doorway

The Reverend Ronald is so kind He enters so fully into our spirit of
inquiry and takes such pleasure in our enthusiasms He even sprang
lightly out of Lady Bairds carriage and called to our lamiter to halt
while he showed us the site of the Black Turnpike from whose windows
Queen Mary saw the last of her kingdoms capital

Here was the Black Turnpike Miss Hamilton he cried and from
here Mary went to Loch Leven where you Hamiltons and the Setons came
gallantly to her help Dont you remember the far ride to the Solway
sands

I looked with interest though I was in such a state of delicious
excitement that I could scarce keep my seat

Only a few minutes more Salemina I sighed and we shall be in the
palace courtyard then a probable halfhour in crowded dressingrooms
with another halfhour in line and then then we shall be making
our best republican bow in the Gallery of the Kings How I wish Mr
Beresford and Francesca were with us What do you suppose was her
real reason for staying away Some petty disagreement with our young
minister I am sure Do you think the dampness is taking the curl out
of our hair Do you suppose our gowns will be torn to ribbons before the
Marchioness sees them Do you believe we shall look as well as anybody
Privately I think we must look better than anybody but I always think
that on my way to a party never after I arrive

Mrs MCollop had asserted that I was bonnie eneuch for ony court and
I could not help wishing that mine ain dear Somebody might see me
in my French frock embroidered with silver thistles and my shower
bouquet of Scottish bluebells tied loosely together Salemina wore
pinkypurple velvet a real heather colour it was though the Lord High
Commissioner would probably never note the fact

When we had presented our cards of invitation at the palace doors we
joined the throng and patiently made our way up the splendid staircases
past powdered lackeys without number and divested of our wraps joined
another throng on our way to the throneroom Salemina and I pressing
those cards with our names legibly written on them close to our
palpitating breasts

At last the moment came when Lady Baird having preceded me I handed
my bit of pasteboard to the usher and hearing Miss Hamilton called in
stentorian accents I went forward in my turn and executed a graceful
and elegant but not too profound curtsy carefully arranged to suit the
semiroyal semiecclesiastical occasion I had not divulged that fact
even to Salemina but I had worn Mrs MCollops carpet quite threadbare
in front of the long mirror and had curtsied to myself so many times in
its crystal surface that I had developed a sort of fictitious reverence
for my reflected image I had only begun my wellpractised
obeisance when Her Grace the Marchioness to my mingled surprise and
embarrassment extended a gracious hand and murmured my name in a
particularly kind voice She is fond of Lady Baird and perhaps chose
this method of showing her friendship or it may be that she noticed my
silver thistles and Saleminas heathercoloured velvetthey certainly
deserved special recognition or it may be that I was too beautiful to
pass over in silencein my state of exaltation I was quite equal to
the belief

The presentation over we wandered through the spacious apartments
leaning from the open windows to hear the music of the band playing in
the courtyard below looking at the royal portraits and chatting with
groups of friends who appeared and reappeared in the throng Finally
Lady Baird sent for us to join her in a knot of personages more or less
distinguished who had dined at the palace and who were standing behind
the receiving party in a sort of sacred group This indeed was a ground
of vantage and one could have stood there for hours watching all sorts
and conditions of men and women bowing before the Lord High Commissioner
and the Marchioness who with her Cleopatralike beauty and scarlet
gown looked like a gorgeous cardinalflower

Salemina and I watched the curtsying narrowly with the view at first of
improving our own obeisances for Buckingham Palace but truth to say
we got no added light and plainly most of the people had not worn
threadbare the carpets in front of their dressingmirrors

Suddenly we heard a familiar name announced Lord Colquhoun a
distinguished judge who had lately been raised to the peerage and whom
we often met at dinners then Miss Rowena Colquhoun and then in
the midst we fancied of an unusual stir at the entrance doorMiss
Francesca Van Buren Monroe I involuntarily touched the Reverend
Ronalds shoulder in my astonishment while Salemina lifted her
tortoiseshell lorgnette and we gazed silently at our recreant charge

After presentation each person has fifteen or twenty feet of awful
space to traverse in solitary and defenceless majesty scanned meanwhile
by the maids of honour who if they were truly honourable would turn
their eyes another way ladiesinwaiting the sacred group in the
rear and the PurseBearer himself I had supposed that this functionary
would keep the purse in his upper bureau drawer at home when he was not
paying bills but it seems that when on processional duty he carries
a bag of red velvet quite a yard long over his arm where it looks not
unlike a ladys operacloak It would hold the sumtotal of all moneys
disbursed even if they were reduced to the standard of vulgar copper

Under this appalling fire of inspection some of the victims waddle
some hurry some look up and down nervously others glance over the
shoulder as if dreading to be apprehended some turn red others pale
according to complexion and temperament some swing their arms other
trip on their gowns some twitch the buttons of a glove or tweak a
flower or a jewel Francesca rose superior to all these weaknesses
and I doubt if the Gallery of the Kings ever served as a background for
anything lovelier or more highbred than that untitled slip of a girl
from the States Her trailing gown of pearlwhite satin fell in
unbroken lustrous folds behind her Her beautiful throat and shoulders
rose in statuesque whiteness from the mist of chiffon that encircled
them Her dark hair showed a moonbeam parting that rested the eye
wearied by the contemplation of waves and frizzes fresh from the
curlingtongs Her mothers pearls hung in ropes from neck to waist and
the one spot of colour about her was the single American Beauty rose
she carried There is a patriotic florist in Paris who grows these
longstemmed empresses of the rosegarden and Mr Beresford sends some
to me every week Francesca had taken the flower without permission and
I must say she was as worthy of it as it of her

She curtsied deeply with no exaggerated ceremony but with a sort
of innocent and childlike gravity while the satin of her gown spread
itself like a great blossom over the floor Her head was bowed until the
dark lashes swept her crimson cheeks then she rose again from the heart
of the shimmering lily with the one splendid rose glowing against all
her dazzling whiteness and floated slowly across the dreaded space
to the door of exit as if she were preceded by invisible heralds and
followed by invisible trainbearers

Who is she we heard whispered here and there Look at the rose
Look at the pearls Is she a princess or only an American

I glanced at the Reverend Ronald I imagined he looked pale at any rate
he was biting his under lip nervously and I believe he was in fancy
laying his serious Scottish allopathic Presbyterian heart at
Francescas gay American homoeopathic Swedenborgian feet

It is a pity Miss Monroe is such an ardent republican he said with
unconcealed bitterness otherwise she ought to be a duchess I never
saw a head that better suited a coronet nor if you will pardon me one
that contained more caprices

It is true she flatly refused to accompany us here I allowed but
perhaps she has some explanation more or less silly and serviceable
meantime I defy you to tell me she isnt a beauty and I implore you
to say nothing about its being only skindeep Give me a beautiful
exterior say I and I will spend my life in making the hidden things of
mind and soul conform to it but deliver me from all forlorn attempts to
make my beauty of character speak through a large mouth breathe through
a fat nose and look at my neighbour through crossed eyes

Mr Macdonald agreed with me with some few ministerial reservations He
always agrees with me and why he is not tortured at the thought of
my being the promised bride of another but continues to squander his
affections upon a quarrelsome and unappreciative girl is more than I can
comprehend

Francesca escorted by Lord Colquhoun appeared presently in our group
but Salemina did not even attempt to scold her One cannot scold an
imperious young beauty in white satin and pearls particularly if she is
leaning nonchalantly on the arm of a peer of the realm

It seems that shortly after our departure we had dined with Lady
Baird Lord Colquhoun had sent a note to me requiring an answer
Francesca had opened it and found that he offered an extra card of
invitation to one of us and said that he and his sister would gladly
serve as escort to Holyrood if desired She had had an hour or two of
solitude by this time and was well weary of it while the last vestige
of headache disappeared under the temptation of appearing at court with
all the eclat of unexpectedness She despatched a note of acceptance to
Lord Colquhoun summoned Mrs MCollop Susanna and the maiden Boots to
her assistance spread the trays of her Saratoga trunks about our three
bedrooms grouped all our candles on her dressingtable and borrowed
any trinket or bit of frippery which we chanced to have left behind
Her own store of adornments is much greater than ours but we possess
certain articles for which she has a childlike admiration my white
satin slippers embroidered with seed pearls Saleminas pearltopped
comb Saleminas Valenciennes handkerchief and diamond beltclasp my
pearl frog with ruby eyes We identified our property on her impertinent
young person and the list of her borrowings so amused the Reverend
Ronald that he forgot his injuries

It is really an ordeal that presentation no matter how strong ones
sense of humour may be nor how well rooted ones democracy chattered
Francesca to a serried rank of officers who surrounded her to the
total routing of the ministry It is especially trying if one has come
unexpectedly and has no idea of what is to happen I was agitated at the
supreme moment because at the entrance of the throneroom I had
just shaken hands reverently with a splendid person who proved to be a
footman Of course I took him for the Commander of the Queens Guards
or the Keeper of the Dungeon Keys or the Most Noble Custodian of the
Royal Moats Drawbridges and Portcullises When he put out his hand I
had no idea it was simply to waft me onward and so naturally I shook
itits a mercy that I didnt kiss it Then I curtsied to the Royal
Usher and overlooked the Lord High Commissioner altogether having no
eyes for any one but the beautiful scarlet Marchioness I only hope they
were too busy to notice my mistakes otherwise I shall be banished
from Court at the very moment of my presentationDo you still
banish nowadays turning the battery of her eyes upon a particularly
insignificant officer who was far too dazed to answer And did you
see the child of ten who was next to me in line She is Mrs
Macstronachlacher at least that was the name on the card she carried
and she was thus announced As they tell us the PurseBearer is most
rigorous in arranging these functions and issuing the invitations I
presume she must be Mrs Macstronachlacher but if so they marry very
young in Scotland and her skirts should really have been longer



Chapter XII Farewell to Edinburgh



It is our last day in Scotias darling seat our last day in
Breadalbane Terrace our last day with Mrs MCollop and though every
one says that we shall love the life in the country we are loath to
leave Auld Reekie

Salemina and I have spent two days in search of an abidingplace and
have visited eight wellrecommended villages with that end in view but
she disliked four of them and I couldnt endure the other four though
I considered some of those that fell under her disapproval as quite
delightful in every respect

We never take Francesca on these pilgrimages of disagreement as three
conflicting opinions on the same subject would make insupportable what
is otherwise rather exhilarating She starts from Edinburgh tomorrow
for a brief visit to the Highlands with the Dalziels and will join us
when we have settled ourselves

Mr Beresford leaves Paris as soon after our decision as he is
permitted so Salemina and I have agreed to agree upon one ideal spot
within thirtysix hours of our quitting Edinburgh knowing privately
that after a last battleroyal we shall enthusiastically support the
joint decision for the rest of our lives

We have been bidding goodbye to people and places and things and
wishing the sun would not shine and thus make our task the harder
We have looked our last on the old grey town from Calton Hill of all
places the best perhaps for a view since as Stevenson says from
Calton Hill you can see the Castle which you lose from the Castle and
Arthurs Seat which you cannot see from Arthurs Seat We have taken a
farewell walk to the Dean Bridge to gaze wistfully eastward and marvel
for the hundredth time to find so beautiful a spot in the heart of
a city The softflowing Water of Leith winding over pebbles between
grassy banks and groups of splendid trees the roof of the little temple
to Hygeia rising picturesquely among green branches the slopes of
emerald velvet leading up to the grey stone of the houseswhere in
all the world of cities can one find a view to equal it in peaceful
loveliness Francescas bridgeman who by the way proved to be a
distinguished young professor of medicine in the University says
that the beautiful cities of the world should be ranked
thusConstantinople Prague Genoa Edinburgh but having seen only
one of these and that the last I refuse to credit any sliding scale of
comparison which leaves Edina at the foot

It was nearing teatime an hour when we never fail to have visitors
and we were all in the drawingroom together I was at the piano
singing Jacobite melodies for Saleminas delectation When I came to
the last verse of Lady Nairnes Hundred Pipers the spirited words had
taken my fancy captive and I am sure I could not have sung with more
vigour and passion had my people been out with the Chevalier

 The Esk was swollen sae red an sae deep
 But shouther to shouther the brave lads keep
 Twa thousand swam owre to fell English ground
 An danced themselves dry to the pibrochs sound
 Dumfounderd the English saw they saw
 Dumfounderd they heard the blaw the blaw
 Dumfounderd they a ran awa awa
 Frae the hundred pipers an a an a

By the time I came to Dumfounderd the English saw Francesca left
her book and joined in the next four lines and when we broke into the
chorus Salemina rushed to the piano and although she cannot sing she
lifted her voice both high and loud in the refrain beating time the
while with a dirk paperknife

 Wi a hundred pipers an a an a
 Wi a hundred pipers an a an a
 Well up an gie them a blaw a blaw
 Wi a hundred pipers an a an a

Susanna ushered in Mr Macdonald and Dr Moncrieffe as the last blaw
faded into silence and Jean Dalziel came upstairs to say that they
could seldom get a quiet moment for family prayers because we
were always at the piano hurling incendiary sentiments into the
airsentiments set to such stirring melodies that no one could resist
them

We are very sorry Miss Dalziel I said penitently We reserve an
hour in the morning and another at bedtime for your uncles prayers
but we had no idea you had them at afternoon tea even in Scotland I
believe that you are chaffing and came up only to swell the chorus
Come let us all sing together from Dumfounderd the English saw

Mr Macdonald and Dr Moncrieffe gave such splendid body to the music
and Jean such warlike energy that Salemina waved her paperknife in a
manner more than ever sanguinary and Susanna hesitating outside the
door for sheer delight had to be coaxed in with the teathings On the
heels of the teathings came the Dominie another dear old friend of six
weeks standing and while the doctor sang Jock o Hazeldean with
such irresistible charm that we all longed to elope with somebody on the
instant Salemina dispensed buttered toast marmalade sandwiches
and the fragrant cup By this time we were thoroughly cosy and Mr
Macdonald made himself and us very much at home by stirring the fire
whereupon Francesca embarrassed him by begging him not to touch it
unless he could do it properly which she added seemed quite unlikely
from the way in which he handled the poker

What will Edinburgh do without you he asked turning towards us with
flattering sadness in his tone Who will hear our Scotch stories never
suspecting their hoary old age Who will ask us questions to which we
somehow always know the answers Who will make us study and reverence
anew our own landmarks Who will keep warm our national and local pride
by judicious enthusiasm

I think the national and local pride may be counted on to exist without
any artificial stimulants dryly observed Francesca whose spirit is
not in the least quenched by approaching departure

Perhaps answered the Reverend Ronald but at any rate you
Miss Monroe will always be able to reflect that you have never been
responsible even for its momentary inflation

Isnt it strange that she cannot get on better with that charming
fellow murmured Salemina as she passed me the sugar for my second
cup

If your present symptoms of blindness continue Salemina I said
searching for a small lump so as to gain time I shall write you a
plaintive ballad buy you a dog and stand you on a street corner If
you had ever permitted yourself to get on with any man as Francesca is
getting on with Mr Macdonald you would now be MrsSomebody

Do you know doctor asked the Dominie that Miss Hamilton shed
real tears at Holyrood the other night when the band played Bonnie
Charlies noo awa

They were real I confessed in the sense that they certainly were
not crocodile tears but I am somewhat at a loss to explain them from
a sensible American standpoint Of course my Jacobitism is purely
impersonal though scarcely more so than yours at this late day at
least it is merely a poetic sentiment for which Caroline Baroness
Nairne is mainly responsible My romantic tears came from a vision of
the Bonnie Prince as he entered Holyrood dressed in his short tartan
coat his scarlet breeches and military boots the star of St Andrew on
his breast a blue ribbon over his shoulder and the famous blue velvet
bonnet and white cockade He must have looked so brave and handsome and
hopeful at that moment and the moment was so sadly brief that when the
band played the plaintive air I kept hearing the words

 Mony a heart will break in twa
 Should he no come back again

He did come back again to me that evening and held a phantom levee
behind the Marchioness of Heatherdales shoulder His ghaist looked
bonnie and rosy and confident yet all the time the band was playing the
requiem for his lost cause and buried hopes

I looked towards the fire to hide the moisture that crept again into my
eyes and my glance fell upon Francesca sitting dreamily on a hassock in
front of the cheerful blaze her chin in the hollow of her palm and the
Reverend Ronald standing on the hearthrug gazing at her the poker in
his hand and his heart I regret to say in such an exposed position on
his sleeve that even Salemina could have seen it had she turned her eyes
that way

Jean Dalziel broke the momentary silence I am sure I never hear the
last two lines

 Better loed ye canna be
 Will ye no come back again

without a lump in my throat and she hummed the lovely melody It
is all as you say purely impersonal and poetic My mother is an
Englishwoman but she sings Dumfounderd the English saw they saw
with the greatest fire and fury



Chapter XIII The spell of Scotland



I think I was never so completely under the spell of a country as I
am of Scotland I made this acknowledgment freely but I knew that it
would provoke comment from my compatriots

Oh yes my dear you have been just as spellbound before only you
dont remember it replied Salemina promptly I have never seen a
person more perilously appreciative or receptive than you

Perilously is just the word chimed in Francesca delightedly when
you care for a place you grow porous as it were until after a time you
are precisely like blottingpaper Now there was Italy for example
After eight weeks in Venice you were completely Venetian from your fan
to the ridiculous little crepe shawl you wore because an Italian prince
had told you that centuries were usually needed to teach a woman how
to wear a shawl but that you had been born with the art and
the shoulders Anything but a watery street was repulsive to you
Cobblestones Ordinario duro brutto A gondola Ah bellissima Let
me float for ever thus You bathed your spirit in sunshine and
colour I can hear you murmur now O Venezia benedetta non ti voglio
lasciar

It was just the same when she spent a month in France with the Baroness
de Hautenoblesse continued Salemina When she returned to America it
is no flattery to say that in dress attitude inflection manner she
was a thorough Parisienne There was an elegant superficiality and a
superficial elegance about her that I can never forget nor yet her
extraordinary volubility in a foreign languagethe fluency with which
she expressed her inmost soul on all topics without the aid of a single
irregular verb for these she was never able to acquire oh it was
wonderful but there was no affectation about it she had simply been
a kind of blottingpaper as Miss Monroe says and France had written
itself all over her

I dont wish to interfere with anybodys diagnosis I interposed at
the first possible moment but perhaps after youve both finished your
psychologic investigation the subject may be allowed to explain herself
from the inside so to speak I wont deny the spell of Italy but I
think the spell that Scotland casts over one is quite a different thing
more spiritual more difficult to break Italys charm has something
physical in it it is born of blue sky sunlit waves soft atmosphere
orange sails and yellow moons and appeals more to the senses In
Scotland the climate certainly has nought to do with it but the
imagination is somehow made captive I am not enthralled by the past of
Italy or France for instance

Of course you are not at the present moment said Francesca because
you are enthralled by the past of Scotland and even you cannot be the
slave of two pasts at the same time

I never was particularly enthralled by Italys past I argued with
exemplary patience but the romance of Scotland has a flavour all its
own I do not quite know the secret of it

Its the kilts and the pipes said Francesca

No the history This from Salemina

Or Sir Walter and the literature suggested Mr Macdonald

 Or the songs and ballads ventured Jean Dalziel

There I exclaimed triumphantly you see for yourselves you have
named avenue after avenue along which ones mind is led in charmed
subjection Where can you find battles that kindle your fancy like
Falkirk and Flodden and Culloden and Bannockburn Where a sovereign
that attracts baffles repels allures like Mary Queen of Scotsand
where tell me where is there a Pretender like Bonnie Prince Charlie
Think of the spirit in those old Scottish matrons who could sing

 Ill sell my rock Ill sell my reel
 My ripplingkame and spinningwheel
 To buy my lad a tartan plaid
 A braidsword durk and white cockade

Yes chimed in Salemina when I had finished quoting or that other
verse that goes

 I ance had sons I now hae nane
 I bare them toiling sairlie
 But I would bear them a again
 To lose them a for Charlie

Isnt the enthusiasm almost beyond belief at this distance of time she
went on and isnt it a curious fact as Mr Macdonald told me a moment
ago that though the whole country was vocal with songs for the lost
cause and the fallen race not one in favour of the victors ever became
popular

Sympathy for the under dog as Miss Monroes countrywomen would say
picturesquely remarked Mr Macdonald

I dont see why all the vulgarisms in the dictionary should be foisted
on the American girl retorted Francesca loftily unless indeed it
is a determined attempt to find spots upon the sun for fear we shall
worship it

Quite so quite so returned the Reverend Ronald who has had reason
to know that this phrase reduces Miss Monroe to voiceless rage

The Stuart charm and personal magnetism must have been a powerful
factor in all that movement said Salemina plunging hastily back into
the topic to avert any further recrimination I suppose we feel it even
now and if I had been alive in 1745 I should probably have made myself
ridiculous Old maiden ladies I read this morning were the last
leal Jacobites in Edinburgh spinsterhood in its loneliness remained
ever true to Prince Charlie and the vanished dreams of youth

Yes continued the Dominie the story is told of the last of those
Jacobite ladies who never failed to close her PrayerBook and stand
erect in silent protest when the prayer for King George III and the
reigning family was read by the congregation

Do you remember the prayer of the Reverend Neil MVicar in St
Cuthberts asked Mr Macdonald It was in 1745 after the victory at
Prestonpans when a message was sent to the Edinburgh ministers in the
name of Charles Prince Regent desiring them to open their churches
next day as usual MVicar preached to a large congregation many of
whom were armed Highlanders and prayed for George II and also for
Charles Edward in the following fashion Bless the king Thou knowest
what king I mean May the crown sit long upon his head As for that
young man who has come among us to seek an earthly crown we beseech
Thee to take him to Thyself and give him a crown of glory

Ah what a pity the Bonnie Prince had not died after his meteor victory
at Falkirk exclaimed Jean Dalziel when we had finished laughing at
Mr Macdonalds story

Or at Culloden where quenched in blood on the Muir of Drummossie
the star of the Stuarts sank forever quoted the Dominie There is
where his better self died would that the young Chevalier had died with
it By the way doctor we must not sit here eating goodies and sipping
tea until the dinnerhour for these ladies have doubtless much to do
for their flitting a pretty Scots word for moving

We are quite ready for our flitting so far as packing is concerned
Salemina assured him Would that we were as ready in spirit Miss
Hamilton has even written her farewell poem which I am sure she will
read for the asking

She will read it without that formality murmured Francesca She has
lived and toiled only for this moment and the poem is in her pocket

Delightful said the doctor flatteringly Has she favoured you
already Have you heard it Miss Monroe

Have we heard it ejaculated that young person We have heard nothing
else all the morning What you will take for local colour is nothing
but our mental lifeblood which she has mercilessly drawn to stain her
verses We each tried to write a Scottish poem and as Miss Hamiltons
was better or perhaps I might say less bad than ours we encouraged
her to develop and finish it I wanted to do an imitation of Lindsays

 Adieu Edinburgh thou heich triumphant town
 Within whose bounds richt blithefull have I been

but it proved too difficult Miss Hamiltons general idea was that we
should write some verses in good plain English Then we were to take
out all the final gs and indeed the final letters from all the words
wherever it was possible so that full awful call ball hall and
away should be fu awfu ca ba ha an awa This alone gives
great charm and character to a poem but we were also to change all
words ending in ow into aw This doesnt injure the verse you see as
blaw and snaw rhyme just as well as blow and snow beside bringing tears
to the common eye with their poetic associations Similarly if we had
daughter and slaughter we were to write them dochter and slauchter
substituting in all cases doon froon goon and toon for down frown
gown and town Then we made a list of Scottish idolspet words
national institutions stock phrases beloved objectsconvinced if
we could weave them in we should attain atmosphere Here is the first
list it lengthened speedily thistle tartan haar haggis kirk
claymore parritch broom whin sporran whaup plaid scone collops
whisky mutch cairngorm oatmeal brae kilt brose heather Salemina
and I were too devoted to commonsense to succeed in this weaving
process so Penelope triumphed and won the first prize both for that
and also because she brought in a saying given us by Miss Dalziel about
the social classification of all Scotland into the gentlemen of the
North men of the South people of the West fowk o Fife and the
Paisley bodies We think that her success came chiefly from her writing
the verses with a Scotch plaid leadpencil What effect the absorption
of so much red blue and green paint will have I cannot fancy but she
ate offand upall the tartan glaze before finishing the poem it had
a wonderfully stimulating effect but the end is not yet

Of course there was a chorus of laughter when the young wretch exhibited
my battered pencil bought in Princes Street yesterday its gay Gordon
tints sadly disfigured by the destroying tooth not of Time but of a
bard in the throes of composition

We bestowed a consolation prize on Salemina continued Francesca
because she succeeded in getting hoots losh havers and blethers into
one line but naturally she could not maintain such an ideal standard
Read your verses Pen though there is little hope that our friends will
enjoy them as much as you do Whenever Miss Hamilton writes anything of
this kind she emulates her distinguished ancestor Sir William Hamilton
who always fell off his own chair in fits of laughter when he was
composing verses

With this inspiring introduction I read my lines as follows

 AN AMERICAN GIRLS FAREWELL TO EDINBURGH

 The muse being somewhat under the influence of the Scottish ballad

 I canna thole my ain toun
 Sin I hae dwelt i this
 To bide in Edinboro reek
 Wad be the tap o bliss
 Yon bonnie plaid aboot me hap
 The skirlin pipes gae bring
 With thistles fair tie up my hair
 While I of Scotia sing

 The collops an the cairngorms
 The haggis an the whin
 The Staiblished Free an UP kirks
 The hairt convinced o sin
 The parritch an the heatherbell
 The snawdrap on the shaw
 The bit lams bleatin on the braes
 How can I leave them a

 How can I leave the marmalade
 An bonnets o Dundee
 The haar the haddies an the brose
 The East win blawin free
 How can I lay my sporran by
 An sit me doun at hame
 Wioot a Hieland philabeg
 Or hyphenated name

 I loe the gentry o the North
 The Southern men I loe
 The canty people o the West
 The Paisley bodies too
 The pawky folk o Fife are dear
 Sae dear are ane an a
 That een to think that we maun pairt
 Maist braks my hairt in twa

 So fetch me tartans heather scones
 An dye my tresses red
 Id deck me like th unconquerd Scots
 Wha hae wi Wallace bled
 Then bind my claymore to my side
 My kilt an mutch gae bring
 While Scottish lays soun i my lugs
 MKinleys no my king

 For Charlie bonnie Stuart Prince
 Has turned me Jacobite
 Id wear displayed the white cockade
 An whiles for him Ill fight
 An whiles Id fight for a thats Scotch
 Save whusky an oatmeal
 For wi their ballads i my bluid
 Nae Scot could be mair leal

I fancied that I had pitched my verses in so high a key that no one
could mistake their burlesque intention What was my confusion however
to have one of the company remark when I finished Extremely pretty
but a mutch you know is an article of WOMANS apparel and would never
be worn with a kilt

Mr Macdonald flung himself gallantly into the breach He is such a dear
fellow So quick so discriminating so warmhearted

Dont pick flaws in Miss Hamiltons finest line That picture of a fair
American clad in a kilt and mutch decked in heather and scones and
brandishing a claymore will live for ever in my memory Dont clip the
wings of her imagination You will be telling her soon that one doesnt
tie ones hair with thistles nor couple collops with cairngorms

Somebody sent Francesca a great bunch of yellow broom late that
afternoon There was no name in the box she said but at night she wore
the odorous tips in the bosom of her black dinnergown and standing
erect in her dark hair like golden aigrettes

When she came into my room to say good night she laid the pretty frock
in one of my trunks which was to be filled with garments of fashionable
society and left behind in Edinburgh The next moment I chanced to look
on the floor and discovered a little card a bent card with two lines
written on it

 Better loed ye canna be
 Will ye no come back again

We have received many invitations in that handwriting I know it well
and so does Francesca though it is blurred and the reason for this
according to my way of thinking is that it has been lying next
the moist stems of flowers and unless I do her wrong very near to
somebodys warm heart as well

I will not betray her to Salemina even to gain a victory over that
blind and deaf but much beloved woman How could I with my heart
beating high at the thought of seeing my ain dear laddie before many
days

 Oh love love lassie
 Love is like a dizziness
 It winna lat a puir body
 Gang aboot his business



Chapter XIV The wee theekit hoosie in the loaning



 Now shes cast aff her bonny shoon
 Made o gilded leather
 And shes put on her Hieland brogues
 To skip amang the heather
 And shes cast aff her bonny goon
 Made o the silk and satin
 And shes put on a tartan plaid
 To row amang the braken

Lizzie Baillie



We are in the East Neuk o Fife we are in Pettybaw we are neither
boarders nor lodgers we are residents inhabitants householders and
we live live mind you in a wee theekit hoosie in the old loaning
Words fail to tell you how absolutely Scotch we are and how blissfully
happy It is a happiness I assure you achieved through great
tribulation Salemina and I travelled many miles in railway trains and
many in various other sorts of wheeled vehicles while the ideal
ever beckoned us onward I was determined to find a romantic lodging
Salemina a comfortable one and this special combination of virtues
is next to impossible as every one knows Linghurst was too much of a
town Bonnie Craig had no respectable inn Winnybrae was struggling to
be a wateringplace Broomlea had no golfcourse within ten miles and
we intended to go back to our native land and win silver goblets in
mixed foursomes the new toun o Fairlock which looked centuries old
was delightful but we could not find apartments there Pinkie Leith was
nice but they were tearing up the fore street and laying drainpipes
in it Strathdee had been highly recommended but it rained when we were
in Strathdee and nobody can deliberately settle in a place where it
rains during the process of deliberation No train left this moist and
dripping hamlet for three hours so we took a covered trap and drove
onward in melancholy mood Suddenly the clouds lifted and the rain
ceased the driver thought we should be having settled weather now and
put back the top of the carriage saying meanwhile that it was a verra
dry simmer this year and that the crops sairly needed shoors

Of course if there is any district in Scotland where for any reason
droughts are possible that is where we wish to settle I whispered to
Salemina though so far as I can see the Strathdee crops are up to
their knees in mud Here is another wee village What is this place
driver

Pettybaw mam a fine toun

Will there be apartments to let there

I cudna say mam

Susanna Crums father How curious that he should live here I
murmured and at this moment the sun came out and shone full or at
least almost full on our future home

Pettybaw Petit bois I suppose said Salemina and there to be
sure it isthe little wood yonder

We drove to the Pettybaw Inn and Posting Establishment and alighting
dismissed the driver We had still three good hours of daylight
although it was five oclock and we refreshed ourselves with a
delicious cup of tea before looking for lodgings We consulted the
greengrocer the baker and the flesher about furnished apartments and
started on our quest not regarding the little posting establishment as
a possibility Apartments we found to be very scarce and in one or two
places that were quite suitable the landlady refused to do any cooking
We wandered from house to house the sun shining brighter and brighter
and Pettybaw looking lovelier and lovelier and as we were refused
shelter again and again we grew more and more enamoured as is the
manner of human kind The blue sea sparkled and Pettybaw Sands gleamed
white a mile or two in the distance the pretty stone church raised its
curved spire from the green trees the manse next door was hidden in
vines the sheep lay close to the grey stone walls and the young lambs
nestled beside them while the song of the burn tinkling merrily down
the glade on the edge of which we stood and the cawing of the rooks in
the little wood were the only sounds to be heard

Salemina under the influence of this sylvan solitude nobly declared
that she could and would do without a set bathtub and proposed
building a cabin and living near to natures heart

I think on the whole we should be more comfortable living near to
the innkeepers heart I answered Let us go back there and pass the
night trying thus the bed and breakfast with a view to seeing what
they are likealthough they did say in Edinburgh that nobody thinks of
living in these wayside hostelries

Back we went accordingly and after ordering dinner came out and
strolled idly up the main street A small sign in the drapers window
heretofore overlooked caught our eye House and Garden To Let Inquire
Within Inquiring within with all possible speed we found the draper
selling winceys the drapers assistant tidying the ribbonbox the
drapers wife sewing in one corner and the drapers baby playing on the
clean floor We were impressed favourably and entered into negotiations
without delay

The house will be in the loaning do you mind maam asked the
draper We have long since discovered that this use of the verb is a
bequest from the Gaelic in which there is no present tense Man never
is but always to be blessed in that language which in this particular
is not unlike oldfashioned Calvinism

We went out of the back door and down the green loaning until we came
to the wee stone cottage in which the draper himself lives most of the
year retiring for the warmer months to the back of his shop and eking
out a comfortable income by renting his hearthstone to the summer
visitor

The thatched roof on the wing that formed the kitchen attracted my
artists eye and we went in to examine the interior which we found
surprisingly attractive There was a tiny sittingroom with a fireplace
and a microscopic piano a diningroom adorned with portraits of
relatives who looked nervous when they met my eye for they knew that
they would be turned face to the wall on the morrow four bedrooms a
kitchen and a back garden so filled with vegetables and flowers that we
exclaimed with astonishment and admiration

But we cannot keep house in Scotland objected Salemina Think of the
care And what about the servants

Why not eat at the inn I suggested Think of living in a real
loaning Salemina Look at the stone floor in the kitchen and the
adorable stuffy boxbed in the wall Look at the bust of Sir Walter
in the hall and the chromo of Melrose Abbey by moonlight Look at the
lintel over the front door with a ship moon stars and 1602 carved in
the stone What is food to all this

Salemina agreed that it was hardly worth considering and in truth so
many landladies had refused to receive her as a tenant that day that her
spirits were rather low and she was uncommonly flexible

It is the lintel and the back garden that rents the hoose remarked
the draper complacently in broad Scotch that I cannot reproduce He is a
houseagent as well as a draper and went on to tell us that when he had
a cottage he could rent in no other way he planted plenty of creepers
in front of it The bakers hoose is no sae bonnie he said and the
linen and cutlery verra scanty but there is a yellow laburnum growin
by the door the leddies see that and forget to ask aboot the linen It
depends a good bit on the weather too it is easy to let a hoose when
the sun shines upon it

We hardly dare undertake regular housekeeping I said do your
tenants ever take meals at the inn

I cudna say mam Dear dear the Crums are a large family

If we did that we should still need a servant to keep the house tidy
said Salemina as we walked away Perhaps housemaids are to be had
though not nearer than Edinburgh I fancy

This gave me an idea and I slipped over to the postoffice while
Salemina was preparing for dinner and despatched a telegram to Mrs
MCollop at Breadalbane Terrace asking her if she could send a reliable
general servant to us capable of cooking simple breakfasts and caring
for a house

We had scarcely finished our Scotch broth fried haddies muttonchops
and rhubarb tart when I received an answer from Mrs MCollop to the
effect that her sisters husbands niece Jane Grieve could join us
on the morrow if we desired The relationship was an interesting fact
though we scarcely thought the information worth the additional pennies
we paid for it in the telegram however Mrs MCollops comfortable
assurance together with the quality of the rhubarb tart and
muttonchops brought us to a decision Before going to sleep we rented
the drapers house named it BideaWee Cottage engaged daily
luncheons and dinners for three persons at the Pettybaw Inn and Posting
Establishment telegraphed to Edinburgh for Jane Grieve to Callander
for Francesca and despatched a letter to Paris for Mr Beresford
telling him we had taken a wee theekit hoosie and that the yett was
ajee whenever he chose to come

Possibly it would have been wiser not send for them until we were
settled I said reflectively Jane Grieve may not prove a suitable
person

The name somehow sounds too young and inexperienced observed
Salemina and what association have I with the phrase sisters
husbands niece

You have heard me quote Lewis Carrolls verse perhaps

 He thought he saw a buffalo
 Upon the chimneypiece
 He looked again and found it was
 His sisters husbands niece
 Unless you leave the house he said
 Ill send for the police

The only thing that troubles me I went on is the question of Willie
Beresfords place of residence He expects to be somewhere within easy
walking or cycling distancefour or five miles at most

He wont be desolate even if he doesnt have a thatched roof a
pansy garden and a blossoming shrub said Salemina sleepily for our
business arrangements and discussions had lasted well into the evening
What he will want is a lodging where he can have frequent sight and
speech of you How I dread him How I resent his sharing of you with us
I dont know why I use the word sharing forsooth There is nothing
half so fair and just in his majestys greedy mind Well its the way
of the world only it is odd with the universe of women to choose from
that he must needs take you Strathdee seems the most desirable place
for him if he has a macintosh and rubber boots Inchcaldy is another
town near here that we didnt see at allthat might do the drapers
wife says that we can send fine linen to the laundry there

Inchcaldy Oh yes I think we heard of it in Edinburghat least I have
some association with the name it has a fine golfcourse I believe
and very likely we ought to have looked at it although for my part I
have no regrets Nothing can equal Pettybaw and I am so pleased to be a
Scottish householder Arent we just like Bessie Bell and Mary Gray

 They were twa bonnie lassies
 They biggit a bower on yon burnbrae
 An theekit it ower wi rashes

Think of our stonefloored kitchen Salemina Think of the real boxbed
in the wall for little Jane Grieve She will have redgold hair blue
eyes and a pink cotton gown Think of our own cat Think how Francesca
will admire the 1602 lintel Think of our back garden with our own
neeps and vegetable marrows growing in it Think how they will envy
us at home when they learn that we have settled down into Scottish
yeowomen

 Its oh for a patch of land
 Its oh for a patch of land
 Of all the blessings tongue can name
 Theres nane like a patch of land

Think of Willie coming to step on the floor and look at the bed and
stroke the cat and covet the lintel and walk in the garden and weed the
turnips and pluck the marrows that grow by our ain wee theekit hoosie

Penelope you appear slightly intoxicated Do close the window and come
to bed

I am intoxicated with the caller air of Pettybaw I rejoined leaning
on the windowsill and looking at the stars while I thought Edinburgh
was beautiful it is the most beautiful grey city in the world it
lacked one thing only to make it perfect and Pettybaw will have that
before many moons

 Oh Willies rare an Willies fair
 An Willies wondrous bonny
 An Willies hecht to marry me
 Gin eer he marries ony

 O gentle wind that bloweth south
 From where my love repaireth
 Convey a word from his dear mouth
 An tell me how he fareth



Chapter XV Jane Grieve and her grievances



 Gae tak awa the china plates
 Gae tak them far frae me
 And bring to me a wooden dish
 Its that Im best used wi
 And tak awa thae siller spoons
 The like I neer did see
 And bring to me the horn cutties
 Theyre good eneugh for me

Earl Richards Wedding



The next day was one of the most cheerful and one of the most fatiguing
that I ever spent Salemina and I moved every article of furniture
in our wee theekit hoosie from the place where it originally stood to
another and a better place arguing of course over the precise spot
it should occupy which was generally upstairs if the thing were already
down or downstairs if it were already up We hid all the more hideous
ornaments of the drapers wife and folded away her most objectionable
tidies and tablecovers replacing them with our own pretty draperies
There were only two pictures in the sittingroom and as an artist I
would not have parted with them for worlds The first was The Life of
a Fireman which could only remind one of the explosion of a mammoth
tomato and the other was The Spirit of Poetry calling Burns from the
Plough Burns wore white kneebreeches military boots a splendid
waistcoat with lace ruffles and carried a cocked hat To have been
so dressed he must have known the Spirit was intending to come The
ploughhorse was a magnificent Arabian whose tail swept the freshly
furrowed earth while the Spirit of Poetry was issuing from a
practicable wigwam on the left and was a lady of such ample dimensions
that no poet would have dared say no when she called him

The diningroom was blighted by framed photographs of the drapers
relations and the drapers wifes relations all uniformly ugly It
seems strange that married couples having the least beauty to bequeath
to their offspring should persist in having the largest families These
ladies and gentlemen were too numerous to remove so we obscured them
with trailing branches reflecting that we only breakfasted in the room
and the morning meal is easily digested when one lives in the open air
We arranged flowers everywhere and bought potted plants at a little
nursery hard by We apportioned the bedrooms giving Francesca the
hardest bedas she is the youngest and wasnt here to chooseme the
next hardest and Salemina the best Francesca the largest lookingglass
and wardrobe me the best view and Salemina the largest bath We bought
housekeeping stores distributing our patronage equally between the two
grocers we purchased aprons and dustcloths from the rival drapers
engaged bread and rolls from the baker milk and cream from the plumber
who keeps three cows interviewed the flesher about chops in fact no
young couple facing love in a cottage ever had a busier or happier time
than we and at sundown when Francesca arrived we were in the pink of
order standing under our own lintel ready to welcome her to Pettybaw
As to being strangers in a strange land we had a bowing acquaintance
with everybody on the main street of the tiny village and were on terms
of considerable intimacy with half a dozen families including dogs and
babies

Francesca was delighted with everything from the station Pettybaw
Sands two miles away to Jane Grieves name which she thought
as perfect in its way as Susanna Crums She had purchased a
tirlingpin that oldtime precursor of knockers and bells at an
antique shop in Oban and we fastened it on the front door at once
taking turns at risping it until our own nerves were shattered and
the drapers wife ran down the loaning to see if we were in need of
anything The twisted bar of iron stands out from the door and the ring
is drawn up and down over a series of nicks making a rasping noise The
lovers and ghaists in the old ballads always tirled at the pin you
remember that is touched it gently

Francesca brought us letters from Edinburgh and what was my joy
in opening Willies to learn that he begged us to find a place in
Fifeshire and as near St Rules or Strathdee as convenient for in that
case he could accept an invitation he had just received to visit his
friend Robin Anstruther at Rowardennan Castle

It is not the visit at the castle I wish so much you may be sure he
wrote as the fact that Lady Ardmore will make everything pleasant for
you You will like my friend Robin Anstruther who is Lady Ardmores
youngest brother and who is going to her to be nursed and coddled after
a baddish accident in the huntingfield He is very sweettempered and
will get on well with Francesca

I dont see the connection rudely interrupted that spirited young
person

I suppose she has more room on her list in the country than she had in
Edinburgh but if my remembrance serves me she always enrolls a goodly
number of victims whether she has any immediate use for them or not

Mr Beresfords manners have not been improved by his residence in
Paris observed Francesca with resentment in her tone and delight in
her eye

Mr Beresfords manners are always perfect said Salemina loyally
and I have no doubt that this visit to Lady Ardmore will be extremely
pleasant for him though very embarrassing to us If we are thrown into
forced intimacy with a castle Salemina spoke of it as if it had fangs
and a lashing tail what shall we do in this drapers hut

Salemina I expostulated bears will devour you as they did the
ungrateful child in the fairytale I wonder at your daring to use the
word hut in connection with our wee theekit hoosie

They will never understand that we are doing all this for the novelty
of it she objected The Scottish nobility and gentry probably never
think of renting a house for a joke Imagine Lord and Lady Ardmore the
young Ardmores Robin Anstruther and Willie Beresford calling upon us
in this sittingroom We ourselves would have to sit in the hall and
talk in through the doorway

All will be well Francesca assured her soothingly We shall be
pardoned much because we are Americans and will not be expected to know
any better Besides the gifted Miss Hamilton is an artist and that
covers a multitude of sins against conventionality When the castle
people tirl at the pin I will appear as the maid if you like
following your example at Mrs Bobbys cottage in Belvern Pen

And it isnt as if there were many houses to choose from Salemina nor
as if BideaWee cottage were cheap I continued Think of the rent we
pay and keep your head high Remember that the drapers wife says there
is nothing half so comfortable in Inchcaldy although that is twice as
large a town

INCHCALDY ejaculated Francesca sitting down heavily upon the sofa
and staring at me

Inchcaldy my dearspelled CALDY but pronounced CAWDY the
town where you are to take your nonsensical little fripperies to be
laundered

Where is Inchcaldy How far away

About five miles I believe but a lovely road

Well she exclaimed bitterly of course Scotland is a small
insignificant country but tiny as it is it presents some liberty
of choice and why you need have pitched upon Pettybaw and brought
me here when it is only five miles from Inchcaldy and a lovely road
besides is more than I can understand

In what way has Inchcaldy been so unhappy as to offend you I asked

It has not offended me save that it chances to be Ronald Macdonalds
parishthat is all

Ronald Macdonalds parish we repeated automatically

Certainlyyou must have heard him mention Inchcaldy and how queer
he will think it that I have come to Pettybaw under all the
circumstances

We do not know all the circumstances quoted Salemina somewhat
haughtily and you must remember my dear that our opportunities for
speech with Mr Macdonald have been very rare when you were present For
my part I was always in such a tremor of anxiety during his visits lest
one or both of you should descend to blows that I remember no details of
his conversation Besides we did not choose Pettybaw we discovered it
by chance as we were driving from Strathdee to St Rules How were we
to know that it was near this fatal Inchcaldy If you think it best we
will hold no communication with the place and Mr Macdonald need never
know you are here

I thought Francesca looked rather startled at this proposition At all
events she said hastily Oh well let it go we could not avoid each
other long anyway although it is very awkward of course you see we
did not part friends

I thought I had never seen you on more cordial terms remarked
Salemina

But you werent there answered Francesca unguardedly

Werent where

Werent there

Where

At the station

What station

The station in Edinburgh from which I started for the Highlands

You never said that he came to see you off

The matter was too unimportant for notice and the more I think of his
being here the less I mind it after all and so dull care begone
When I first meet him on the sands or in the loaning I shall say Dear
me is it Mr Macdonald What brought you to our quiet hamlet I shall
put the responsibility on him you know That is the worst of these
small countriesfowk are aye i the gait When we part for ever in
America we are able to stay parted if we wish Then he will say
Quite so quite so but I suppose even you Miss Monroe will allow
that a minister may not move his church to please a lady Certainly
not I shall reply especially when it is Estaiblished Then he will
laugh and we shall be better friends for a few moments and then I
shall tell him my latest story about the Scotchman who prayed Lord I
do not ask that Thou shouldst give me wealth only show me where it is
and I will attend to the rest

Salemina moaned at the delightful prospect opening before us while I
went to the piano and carolled impersonally

 Oh wherefore did I cross the Forth
 And leave my love behind me
 Why did I venture to the north
 With one that did not mind me
 Im sure Ive seen a better limb
 And twenty better faces
 But still my mind it runs on him
 When I am at the races

Francesca left the room at this and closed the door behind her with
such energy that the bust of Sir Walter rocked on the hall shelf
Running upstairs she locked herself in her bedroom and came down again
only to help us receive Jane Grieve who arrived at eight oclock

In times of joy Salemina Francesca and I occasionally have our
trifling differences of opinion but in hours of affliction we are as
one flesh An allwise Providence sent us Jane Grieve for fear that we
should be too happy in Pettybaw Plans made in heaven for the discipline
of sinful human flesh are always successful and this was no exception

We had sent a machine from the inn to meet her and when it drew up at
the door we went forward to greet the rosy little Jane of our fancy An
aged person wearing a rusty black bonnet and shawl and carrying
what appeared to be a tin cakebox and a babys bathtub descended
rheumatically from the vehicle and announced herself as Miss Grieve She
was too old to call by her Christian name too sensitive to call by her
surname so Miss Grieve she remained as announced to the end of the
chapter and our rosy little Jane died before she was actually born The
man took her grotesque luggage into the kitchen and Salemina escorted
her thither while Francesca and I fell into each others arms and
laughed hysterically

Nobody need tell me that she is Mrs MCollops sisters husbands
niece she whispered although she may possibly be somebodys
grandaunt Doesnt she remind you of Mrs Gummidge

Salemina returned in a quarter of an hour and sank dejectedly on the
sofa

Run over to the inn Francesca she said and order bacon and eggs
at eightthirty tomorrow morning Miss Grieve thinks we had better not
breakfast at home until she becomes accustomed to the surroundings

Shall we allow her to become accustomed to them I questioned

She came up from Glasgow to Edinburgh for the day and went to see Mrs
MCollop just as our telegram arrived She was living with an extremely
nice family in Glasgow and only broke her engagement in order to try
Fifeshire air for the summer so she will remain with us as long as she
is benefited by the climate

Cant you pay her for a month and send her away

How can we She is Mrs MCollops sisters husbands niece and we
intend returning to Mrs MCollop She has a nice ladylike appearance
but when she takes her bonnet off she looks seventy years old

She ought always to keep it off then returned Francesca for she
looked eighty with it on We shall have to soothe her last moments of
course and pay her funeral expenses Did you offer her a cup of tea and
show her the boxbed

Yes she said she was muckle obleeged to me but the coals were so poor
and hard she couldna batter them up to start a fire the nicht and she
would try the boxbed to see if she could sleep in it I am glad to
remember that it was you who telegraphed for her Penelope

Let there be no recriminations I responded let us stand shoulder to
shoulder in this calamityisnt there a story called Calamity Jane We
might live at the inn and give her the cottage for a summer residence
but I utterly refuse to be parted from our cat and the 1602 lintel

After I have once described Miss Grieve I shall not suffer her to
begloom these pages as she did our young lives She is so exactly
like her kind in America she cannot be looked upon as a national type
Everywhere we go we see fresh fairhaired sonsie lasses why should
we have been visited by this affliction we who have no courage in a
foreign land to rid ourselves of it

She appears at the door of the kitchen with some complaint and stands
there talking to herself in a depressing murmur until she arrives at the
next grievance Whenever we hear this which is whenever we are in the
sittingroom we amuse ourselves by chanting lines of melancholy poetry
which correspond to the sentiments she seems to be uttering It is the
only way the infliction can be endured for the sittingroom is so small
that we cannot keep the door closed habitually The effect of this plan
is something like the following

She The range has sic a bad draft I canna mak the fire draw

 We But Im ower auld for the tears to start
 An sae the sighs maun blaw

She The clock i the hall doesna strike I have to get oot o my bed
to see the time

 We The broken hairt it kens
 Nae second spring again

She Theres no eneuch jugs i the hoose

 We Im downright dizzy wi the thought
 In troth Im like to greet

She The sink drain isna recht

 We An its oh to win awa awa
 An its oh to win awa

She I canna thole a boxbed

 We Ay waukin O
 Waukin O an weary
 Sleep I can get nane
 Ay waukin O

She Its fair insultin to rent a hoose wi so few convenience

 We An Im ower auld to fish ony mair
 An I hinna the chance to droon

She The work is fair sickenin i this hoose an a for ane puir body
to do by her lane

 We How can ye chant ye little birds
 An I sae weary fu o care

She Ah but that was a fine family I lived wi in Glasgy an its a
wearifu days work Ive had the day

 We Oh why was I spared to cry Waes me

She Why dinna they leave floors i the garden makin a mess i the
hoose wi em Its not for the knowin what they will be after next

 We Oh waly waly up the bank
 And waly waly doon the brae

Miss Grieves plaints never grow less though we are sometimes at a loss
for appropriate quotations to match them The poetic interpolations are
introduced merely to show the general spirit of her conversation They
take the place of her sighs which are by their nature unprintable Many
times each day she is wont to sink into one low chair and extending
her feet in another close her eyes and murmur undistinguishable plaints
which come to us in a kind of rhythmic way She has such a shaking right
hand we have been obliged to give up coffee and have tea as the former
beverage became too unsettled on its journey from the kitchen to
the breakfasttable She says she kens she is a guid cook though
salfpraise is sma racommendation sma as it is she will get nae
ither but we have little opportunity to test her skill as she
prepares only our breakfasts of eggs and porridge Visions of homemade
goodies had danced before our eyes but as the hall clock doesna strike
she is unable to rise at any exact hour and as the range draft is bad
and the coals too hard to batter up wi a hatchet we naturally have to
content ourselves with the bakers loaf

And this is a truthful portrait of Calamity Jane our one Pettybaw
grievance



Chapter XVI The path that led to Crummylowe



 Gae farer up the burn to Habbies Howe
 Where a the sweets o spring an simmer grow
 Between twa birks out oer a little lin
 The water fas an maks a singan din
 A pool breastdeep beneath as clear as glass
 Kisses wi easy whirls the bordring grass

The Gentle Shepherd



That is what Peggy says to Jenny in Allan Ramsays poem and if you
substitute Crummylowe for Habbies Howe in the first line you will
have a lovely picture of the farmsteadin

You come to it by turning the corner from the inn first passing the
cottage where the lady wishes to rent two rooms for fifteen shillings a
week but will not give much attendance as she is slightly asthmatic
and the house is always as clean as it is this minute and the view from
the window looking out on Pettybaw Bay canna be surpassed at ony money
Then comes the little house where Willam Beatties sister Mary died in
May and there wasna a bonnier woman in Fife Next is the cottage with
the pansygarden where the lady in the widows cap takes fiveoclock
tea in the baywindow and a snug little supper at eight She has for
the first scones and marmalade and her tea is in a small black teapot
under a red cosy with a white muslin cover drawn over it At eight she
has more tea and generally a kippered herring or a bit of cold mutton
left from the noon dinner We note the changes in her bill of fare as we
pass hastily by and feel admitted quite into the family secrets Beyond
this baywindow which is so redolent of simple peace and comfort that
we long to go in and sit down is the cottage with the double white
tulips the cottage with the collie on the front steps the doctors
house with the yellow laburnum tree and then the house where the
Disagreeable Woman lives She has a lovely baby which to begin with
is somewhat remarkable as disagreeable women rarely have babies or
else having had them rapidly lose their disagreeablenessso rapidly
that one has not time to notice it The Disagreeable Womans house is at
the end of the row and across the road is a wicketgate leadingWhere
did it leadthat was the very point Along the left as you lean
wistfully over the gate there runs a stone wall topped by a green
hedge and on the right first furrows of pale fawn then below furrows
of deeper brown and mulberry and red ploughed earth stretching down to
waving fields of green and thence to the sea grey misty opalescent
melting into the pearly white clouds so that one cannot tell where sea
ends and sky begins

There is a path between the green hedge and the ploughed field and it
leads seductively to the farmsteadin or we felt that it might thus
lead if we dared unlatch the wicket gate Seeing no sign Private Way
Trespassers Not Allowed or other printed defiance to the stranger
we were considering the opening of the gate when we observed two female
figures coming toward us along the path and paused until they should
come through It was the Disagreeable Woman although we knew it not
and an elderly friend We accosted the friend feeling instinctively
that she was framed of softer stuff and asked her if the path were a
private one It was a question that had never met her ear before and
she was too dull or too discreet to deal with it on the instant To our
amazement she did not even manage to falter I couldna say

Is the path private I repeated

It is certainly the idea to keep it a little private said the
Disagreeable Woman coming into the conversation without being
addressed Where do you wish to go

Nowhere in particular The walk looks so inviting we should like to see
the end

It goes only to the Farm and you can reach that by the highroad it is
only a halfmile further Do you wish to call at the Farm

No oh no the path is so very pretty that

Yes I see well I should call it rather private And with this she
departed leaving us to stand on the outskirts of paradise while she
went into her house and stared at us from the window as she played with
the lovely undeserved baby But that was not the end of the matter

We found ourselves there next day Francesca and ISalemina was too
prouddrawn by an insatiable longing to view the beloved and forbidden
scene We did not dare to glance at the Disagreeable Womans windows
lest our courage should ooze away so we opened the gate and stole
through into the rather private path

It was a most lovely path even if it had not been in a sense
prohibited it would still have been lovely simply on its own merits
There were little gaps in the hedge and the wall through which we
peered into a daisystarred pasture where a white bossy and a herd of
flaxenhaired cows fed on the sweet green grass The mellow ploughed
earth on the right hand stretched down to the shoreline and a
ploughboy walked up and down the long straight furrows whistling My
Nannies awa Pettybaw is so far removed from the musichalls that
their cheap songs and strident echoes never reach its sylvan shades and
the herdladdies and ploughboys still sweeten their labours with the
old classic melodies

We walked on and on determined to come every day and we settled
that if we were accosted by any one or if our innocent business were
demanded Francesca should ask Does Mrs Macstronachlacher live here
and has she any newlaid eggs

Soon the gates of the Farm appeared in sight There was a cluster of
buildings with doves huddling and cooing on the redtiled roofsdairy
houses workmens cottages comely rows of haystacks towering yellow
things with peaked tops a little pond with ducks and geese chattering
together as they paddled about and for additional music the trickling
of two tiny burns making a singan din as they wimpled through the
bushes A specklebreasted thrush perched on a corner of the grey wall
and poured his heart out Overhead there was a chorus of rooks in the
tall trees but there was no sound of human voice save that of the
ploughladdie whistling My Nannies awa

We turned our backs on this darling solitude and retraced our steps
lingeringly As we neared the wicket gate again we stood upon a bit of
jutting rock and peered over the wall sniffing the hawthorn buds with
ecstasy The white bossy drew closer treading softly on its daisy
carpet the wondering cows looked up at us as they peacefully chewed
their cuds a man in corduroy breeches came from a corner of the
pasture and with a sharp narrow hoe rooted out a thistle or two that
had found their way into this sweet feedingground Suddenly we heard
the swish of a dress behind and turned consciencestricken though we
had in nothing sinned

Does Mrs Macstronachlacher live here stammered Francesca like a
parrot

It was an idiotic time and place for the question We had certainly
arranged that she should ask it but something must be left to the
judgment in such cases Francesca was hanging over a stone wall
regarding a herd of cows in a pasture and there was no possible shelter
for a Mrs Macstronachlacher within a quarter of a mile What made
the remark more unfortunate was the fact that although she had on a
different dress and bonnet the person interrogated was the Disagreeable
Woman but Francesca is particularly slow in discerning resemblances
She would have gone on mechanically asking for newlaid eggs had I not
caught her eye and held it sternly The foe looked at us suspiciously
for a moment Francescas hats are not easily forgotten and then
vanished up the path to tell the people at Crummylowe I suppose that
their grounds were invested by marauding strangers whose curiosity was
manifestly the outgrowth of a republican government

As she disappeared in one direction we walked slowly in the other and
just as we reached the corner of the pasture where two stone walls meet
and where a group of oaks gives grateful shade we heard childrens
voices

No no cried somebody it must be still higher at this end for the
towerthis is where the king will sit Help me with this heavy one
Rafe Dandie mind your foot Why dont you be making the flag for the
shipand do keep the Wrig away from us till we finish building



Chapter XVII Playing Sir Patrick Spens



 O lang lang may the ladyes sit
 Wi their face into their hand
 Before they see Sir Patrick Spens
 Come sailing to the strand

Sir Patrick Spens



We forced our toes into the crevices of the wall and peeped stealthily
over the top Two boys of eight or ten years with two younger children
were busily engaged in building a castle A great pile of stones had
been hauled to the spot evidently for the purpose of mending the wall
and these were serving as rich material for sport The oldest of the
company a brighteyed rosycheeked boy in an Eton jacket and broad
white collar was obviously commanderinchief and the next in size
whom he called Rafe was a laddie of eight in kilts These two looked
as if they might be scions of the aristocracy while Dandie and the Wrig
were fat little yokels of another sort The miniature castle must have
been the work of several mornings and was worthy of the respectful but
silent admiration with which we gazed upon it but as the last stone
was placed in the tower the master builder looked up and spied our
interested eyes peering at him over the wall We were properly abashed
and ducked our heads discreetly at once but were reassured by hearing
him run rapidly towards us calling Stop if you please Have you
anything on just noware you busy

We answered that we were quite at leisure

Then would you mind coming in to help us play Sir Patrick Spens
There arent enough of us to do it nicely

This confidence was touching and luckily it was not in the least
misplaced Playing Sir Patrick Spens was exactly in our line little
as he suspected it

Come and help I said Simply delighted Do come Fanny dear How can
we get over the wall

Ill show you the good broken place cried Sir AppleCheek and
following his directions we scrambled through while Rafe took off his
Highland bonnet ceremoniously and handed us down to earth

Hurrah now it will be something like fun Do you know Sir Patrick
Spens


Every word of it Dont you want us to pass an examination before you
allow us in the game

No he answered gravely its a great help of course to know it
but it isnt necessary I keep the words in my pocket to prompt Dandie
and the Wrig can only say two lines shes so little Here he produced
some tattered leaves torn from a book of ballads Weve done it many
a time but this is a new Dunfermline Castle and we are trying the
play in a different way Rafe is the king and Dandie is the eldern
knightyou remember him

Certainly he sat at the kings right knee

Yes yes thats the one Then Rafe is Sir Patrick part of the time
and I the other part because everybody likes to be him but theres
nobody left for the lords o Noroway or the sailors and the Wrig is
the only maiden to sit on the shore and she always forgets to comb her
hair and weep at the right time

The forgetful and placid Wrig I afterwards learned that this is a Scots
word for the youngest bird in the nest was seated on the grass with
her fat hands full of pink thyme and white wild woodruff The sun shone
on her curly flaxen head She wore a dark blue cotton frock with white
dots and a shortsleeved pinafore and though she was utterly useless
from a dramatic point of view she was the sweetest little Scotch
dumpling I ever looked upon She had been tried and found wanting in
most of the principal parts of the ballad but when left out of the
performance altogether she was wont to scream so lustily that all
Crummylowe rushed to her assistance

Now let us practise a bit to see if we know what we are going to do
said Sir AppleCheek Rafe you can be Sir Patrick this time The
reason why we all like to be Sir Patrick he explained turning to me
is that the lords o Noroway say to him

 Ye Scottishmen spend a our Kings gowd
 And a our Queenis fee

and then he answers

 Ye lee ye lee ye leers loud
 Fu loudly do ye lee

and a lot of splendid things like that Well Ill be the king and
accordingly he began

 The King sits in Dunfermline tower
 Drinking the bluidred wine
 O whaur will I get a skeely skipper
 To sail this new ship o mine

A dead silence ensued whereupon the king said testily Now Dandie
you never remember youre the eldern knight go on

Thus reminded Dandie recited

 O up and spake an eldern knight
 Sat at the Kings right knee
 Sir Patrick Spens is the best sailor
 That ever sailed the sea

Now Ill write my letter said the king who was endeavouring to make
himself comfortable in his somewhat contracted tower

 The King has written a braid letter
 And sealed it with his hand
 And sent it to Sir Patrick Spens
 Was walking on the strand

Read the letter out loud Rafe and then youll remember what to do

 To Noroway to Noroway
 To Noroway oer the faem
 The Kings daughter of Noroway
 Tis thou maun bring her hame

read Rafe

Now do the next part

I cant Im going to chuck up that next part I wish youd do Sir
Patrick until it comes to Ye lee ye lee

No that wont do Rafe We have to mix up everybody else but its too
bad to spoil Sir Patrick

Well Ill give him to you then and be the king I dont mind so much
now that weve got such a good tower and why cant I stop up there even
after the ship sets sail and look out over the sea with a telescope
Thats the way Elizabeth did the time she was king

You can stay till you have to come down and be a dead Scots lord Im
not going to lie there as I did last time with nobody but the Wrig for
a Scots lord and her forgetting to be dead

Sir AppleCheek then essayed the hard part chucked up by Rafe It was
rather difficult I confess as the first four lines were in pantomime
and required great versatility

 The first word that Sir Patrick read
 Fu loud loud laughed he
 The neist word that Sir Patrick read
 The tear blinded his ee

These conflicting emotions successfully simulated Sir Patrick
resumed

 O wha is he has done this deed
 And tauld the King o me
 To send us out at this time o the year
 To sail upon the sea

Then the king stood up in the unstable tower and shouted his own
orders

 Be it wind be it weet be it hail be it sleet
 Our ship maun sail the faem
 The Kings daughter o Noroway
 Tis we maun fetch her hame

Cant we rig the ship a little better demanded our stagemanager at
this juncture It isnt half as good as the tower

Ten minutes hard work in which we assisted produced something a
trifle more nautical and seaworthy than the first craft The ground with
a few boards spread upon it was the deck Tarpaulin sheets were arranged
on sticks to represent sails and we located the vessel so cleverly that
two slender trees shot out of the middle of it and served as the tall
topmasts

Now let us make believe that weve hoisted our sails on Mononday morn
and been in Noroway weeks but only twae said our leading man and
your time has come nowturning to us

We felt indeed that it had but plucking up sufficient courage for the
lords o Noroway we cried accusingly

 Ye Scottishmen spend a our Kings gowd
 And a our Queenis fee

Oh but Sir AppleCheek was glorious as he roared virtuously

 Ye lee ye lee ye leers loud
 Fu loudly do you lee

 For I brocht as much white monie
 As gane my men and me
 An I brocht a halffou o gude red gowd
 Out ower the sea wi me

 But betide me well betide me wae
 This day Ise leave the shore
 And never spend my Kings monie
 Mong Noroway dogs no more

 Make ready make ready my merry men a
 Our gude ship sails the morn

Now you be the sailors please

Glad to be anything but Noroway dogs we recited obediently

 Now ever alake my master dear
 I fear a deadly storm
       
 And if ye gang to sea master
 I fear well come to harm

We added much to the effect of this stanza by flinging ourselves on the
turf and embracing Sir Patricks knees with which touch of melodrama he
was enchanted

Then came a storm so terrible that I can hardly trust myself to describe
its fury The entire corps dramatique personated the elements and tore
the gallant ship in twain while Sir Patrick shouted in the teeth of the
gale

 O whaur will I get a gude sailor
 To tak my helm in hand
 Till I get up to the tall topmast
 To see if I can spy land

I knew the words a trifle better than Francesca and thus succeeded in
forestalling her as the fortunate hero

 O here I am a sailor gude
 To tak the helm in hand
 Till you go up to the tall topmast
 But I fear yell neer spy land

And the heroic sailor was right for

 He hadna gone a step a step
 A step but only ane
 When a bout flew out o our goodly ship
 And the saut sea it came in

Then we fetched a web o the silken claith and anither o the twine as
our captain bade us we wapped them into our ships side and letna the
sea come in but in vain in vain Laith were the gude Scots lords to
weet their corkheeled shune but they did and wat their hats abune
for the ship sank in spite of their despairing efforts

 And mony was the gude lords son
 That never mair cam hame

Francesca and I were now obliged to creep from under the tarpaulins and
personate the dishevelled ladies on the strand

Will your hair come down asked the manager gravely

It will and shall we rejoined and it did

 The ladies wrang their fingers white
 The maidens tore their hair

Do tear your hair Jessie Its the only thing you have to do and you
never do it on time

The Wrig made ready to howl with offended pride but we soothed her and
she tore her yellow curls with her chubby hands

 And lang lang may the maidens sit
 Wi there gowd kaims i the hair
 A waitin for their ain dear luves
 For them theyll see nae mair

I did a bit of sobbing here that would have been a credit to Sarah
Siddons

Splendid Grand cried Sir Patrick as he stretched himself fifty
fathoms below the imaginary surface of the water and gave explicit
antemortem directions to the other Scots lords to spread themselves out
in like manner

 Half ower half ower to Aberdour
 Tis fifty fathoms deep
 And there lies gude Sir Patrick Spens
 Wi the Scots lords at his feet

Oh it is grand he repeated jubilantly If I could only be the king
and see it all from Dunfermline tower Could you be Sir Patrick once do
you think now that I have shown you how he asked Francesca

Indeed I could she replied glowing with excitement and small
wonder at being chosen for the principal role

The only trouble is that you do look awfully like a girl in that white
frock

Francesca appeared rather ashamed at her natural disqualifications for
the part of Sir Patrick If I had only worn my long black cloak she
sighed

Oh I have an idea cried the boy Hand her the ministers gown from
the hedge Rafe You see Mistress Ogilvie of Crummylowe lent us this
old gown for a sail shes doing something to a new one and this was
her pattern

Francesca slipped it on over her white serge and the Pettybaw parson
should have seen her with the long veil of her dark locks floating over
his ministerial garment

It seems a pity to put up your hair said the stage manager
critically because you look so jolly and wild with it down but I
suppose you must and will you have Rafes bonnet

Yes she would have Rafes bonnet and when she perched it on the side
of her head and paced the deck restlessly while the black gown floated
behind in the breeze we all cheered with enthusiasm and having
rebuilt the ship began the play again from the moment of the gale The
wreck was more horribly realistic than ever this time because of our
rehearsal and when I crawled from under the masts and sails to seat
myself on the beach with the Wrig I had scarcely strength enough to
remove the cooky from her hand and set her acombing her curly locks

When our new Sir Patrick stretched herself on the ocean bed she fell
with a despairing wail her gown spread like a pall over the earth the
Highland bonnet came off and her hair floated over a haphazard pillow
of Jessies wildflowers

Oh it is fine that part but from here is where it always goes
wrong cried the king from the castle tower Its too bad to take
the maidens away from the strand where they look so bonnie and Rafe
is splendid as the gude sailor but Dandie looks so silly as one little
dead Scots lord if we only had one more person young or old if he was
ever so stupid

WOULD I DO

This unexpected offer came from behind one of the trees that served as
topmasts and at the same moment there issued from that delightfully
secluded retreat Ronald Macdonald in knickerbockers and a golfcap

Suddenly as this apparition came there was no lack of welcome on the
childrens part They shouted his name in glee embraced his legs and
pulled him about like affectionate young bears Confusion reigned for
a moment while Sir Patrick rose from her sea grave all in a mist of
floating hair from which hung impromptu garlands of pink thyme and
green grasses

Allow me to do the honours please Jamie said Mr Macdonald when
he could escape from the childrens clutches Have you been properly
presented I suppose not Ladies the young Master of Rowardennan
Jamie Miss Hamilton and Miss Monroe from the United States of America
Sir AppleCheek bowed respectfully Let me present the Honourable Ralph
Ardmore also from the castle together with Dandie Dinmont and the Wrig
from Crummylowe Sir Patrick it is indeed a pleasure to see you again
Must you take off my gown I had thought it was past use but it never
looked so well before

YOUR gown

The counterfeit presentment of Sir Patrick vanished as the long drapery
flew to the hedge whence it came and there remained only an offended
young goddess who swung her dark mane tempestuously to one side
plaited it in a thick braid tossed it back again over her white serge
shoulder and crowded on her sailor hat with unnecessary vehemence

Yes MY gown whose else could you more appropriately borrow pray
Mistress Ogilvie of Crummylowe presses sponges and darns my bachelor
wardrobe but I confess I never suspected that she rented it out for
theatrical purposes I have been calling upon you in Pettybaw Lady
Ardmore was there at the same time Finding but one of the three
American Graces at home I stayed a few moments only and am now
returning to Inchcaldy by way of Crummylowe Here he plucked the gown
off the hedge and folded it carefully

Cant we keep it for a sail Mr Macdonald pleaded Jamie Mistress
Ogilvie said it wasnt any more good

When Mistress Ogilvie made that remark replied the Reverend Ronald
she had no idea that it would ever touch the shoulders of the martyred
Sir Patrick Spens Now I happen to love

Francesca hung out a scarlet flag in each cheek and I was about to say
Dont mind me when he continued

As I was saying I happen to love Sir Patrick Spensit is my
favourite ballad so with your permission I will take the gown and
you can find something less valuable for a sail

I could never understand just why Francesca was so annoyed at being
discovered in our innocent game Of course she was prone on Mother Earth
and her tresses were much dishevelled but she looked lovely after all
in comparison with me the humble supe and lightningchange artist
yet I kept my temperat least I kept it until the Reverend Ronald
observed after escorting us through the gap in the wall By the way
Miss Hamilton there was a gentleman from Paris at your cottage and he
is walking down the road to meet you

Walking down the road to meet me forsooth Have ministers no brains
The Reverend Mr Macdonald had wasted five good minutes with his
observations introductions explanations felicitations and
adorations and meantime regardezmoi messieurs et mesdames sil
vous plait I have been a Noroway dog a shipbuilder and a gallant
sailorman I have been a gurly sea and a towering gale I have crawled
from beneath broken anchors topsails and mizzenmasts to a strand where
I have been a suffering lady plying a gowd kaim My skirt of blue drill
has been twisted about my person until it trails in front my collar is
wilted my cravat untied I have lost a stud and a sleevelink my hair
is in a tangled mass my face is scarlet and dustyand a gentleman from
Paris is walking down the road to meet me



Chapter XVIII Paris comes to Pettybaw



 There were three ladies in a hall
 With a heighho and a lily gay
 There came a lord among them all
 As the primrose spreads so sweetly

 The Cruel Brother



Willie Beresford has come to Pettybaw and that Arcadian village has
received the last touch that makes it Paradise

We are exploring the neighbourhood together and whichever path we
take we think it lovelier than the one before This morning we drove
to Pettybaw Sands Francesca and Salemina following by the footpath and
meeting us on the shore It is all so enchantingly fresh and green on
one of these rare bright days the trig lass bleaching her claes on
the grass by the burn near the little stone bridge the wild partridges
whirring about in pairs the farmboy seated on the clean straw in the
bottom of his cart and cracking his whip in mere wanton joy at the
sunshine the pretty cottages and the gardens with rows of currant and
gooseberry bushes hanging thick with fruit that suggests jam and tart
in every delicious globule It is a lovecoloured landscape we know it
full well and nothing in the fair world about us is half as beautiful
as what we see in each others eyes Ah the memories of these first
golden mornings together after our long separation I shall sprinkle
them with lavender and lay them away in that dim chamber of the heart
where we keep precious things We all know the chamber It is fragrant
with other hidden treasures for all of them are sweet though some are
sad That is the reason why we put a finger on the lip and say Hush
if we open the door and allow any one to peep in

We tied the pony by the wayside and alighted Willie to gather some
sprays of the pink veronica and blue speedwell I to sit on an old bench
and watch him in happy idleness The whiteblossomed slaes sweetened
the air and the distant hills were gay with golden whin and broom or
flushed with the purplyred of the bell heather

We heard the note of the cushats from a neighbouring bush They used
to build their nests on the ground so the story goes but the cows
trampled them Now they are wiser and build higher and their cry is
supposed to be a derisive one directed to their ancient enemies Come
noo Coo Coo Come noo

A hedgehog crept stealthily along the ground and at a sudden sound
curled himself up like a wee brown bear There were women working in
the fields near bya strange sight to our eyes at first but nothing
unusual here where many of them are employed on the farms all the year
round sowing weeding planting even ploughing in the spring and in
winter working at threshing or in the granary

An old man leaning on his staff came tottering feebly along and sank
down on the bench beside me He was dirty ragged unkempt and feeble
but quite sober and pathetically anxious for human sympathy

Im achtysax year auld he maundered apropos of nothing achtysax
year auld Ive seen five lairds o Pettybaw sax placed meenisters an
seeven doctors I was a mason an a stoot mon i thae days but its a
meeserable life noo Wife deid bairns deid I sit by my lane an smoke
my pipe wi naebody to gie me a sup o water Achtysax is ower auld
for a monower auld

These are the sharp contrasts of life one cannot bear to face when one
is young and happy Willie gave him a halfcrown and some tobacco
for his pipe and when the pony trotted off briskly and we left the
shrunken figure alone on his bench as he was lonely in his life we
kissed each other and pledged ourselves to look after him as long as
we remain in Pettybaw for what is love worth if it does not kindle
the flames of spirit open the gates of feeling and widen the heart to
shelter all the little loves and great loves that crave admittance

As we neared the tiny fishingvillage on the sands we met a fishwife
brave in her short skirt and eight petticoats the basket with its two
hundred pound weight on her head and the auld wife herself knitting
placidly as she walked along They look superbly strong these women
but to be sure the weak anes dee as one of them told me

There was an air of bustle about the little quay

 That joyfu din when the boats come in
 When the boats come in sae early
 When the lift is blue an the herringnets fu
 And the sun glints in a things rarely

The silvery shoals of fish no longer come so near the shore as they used
in the olden time for then the kirk bell of St Monans had its tongue
tied when the draive was off the coast lest its knell should frighten
away the shining myriads of the deep

We climbed the shoulder of a great green cliff until we could sit on the
rugged rocks at the top and overlook the sea The bluff is well named
Nirly Scaur and a wild desolate spot it is with grey lichenclad
boulders and stunted heather on its summit In a storm here the wind
buffets and slashes and scourges one like invisible whips and below the
sea churns itself into foaming waves driving its infinite squadrons
of wild white horses eternally toward the shore It was calm and blue
today and no sound disturbed the quiet save the incessant shriek
and scream of the rock birds the kittiwakes blackheaded gulls and
guillemots that live on the sides of these high sheer craigs Here the
mother guillemot lays her single egg and here on these narrow shelves
of precipitous rock she holds it in place with her foot until the
warmth of her leg and overhanging body hatches it into life when
she takes it on her back and flies down to the sea Motherhood under
difficulties it would seem and the education of the baby guillemot is
carried forward on Spartan principles for the moment he is out of the
shell he is swept downward hundreds of feet and plunged into a cold
ocean where he can sink or swim as instinct serves him In a life so
fraught with anxieties exposures and dangers it is not strange that
the guillemots keeps up a ceaseless clang of excited conversation
a very riot and wrangle of altercation and argument which the
circumstances seem to warrant The prospective father is obliged to take
turns with the prospective mother and hold the one precious egg on the
rock while she goes for a fly a swim a bite and a sup As there are
five hundred other parents on the same rock and the eggs look to be
only a couple of inches apart the scene must be distracting and I have
no doubt we should find if statistics were gathered that thousands of
guillemots die of nervous prostration

Willie and I interpreted the clamour somewhat as follows

Between parent birds

I am going to take my foot off Are you ready to put yours on Dont be
clumsy Wait a minute Im not ready IM NOT READY I TELL YOU NOW

Between rival mothers

Your egg is so close to mine that I cant breathe

Move your egg then I cant move mine

Youre sitting so close I cant stretch my wings

Neither can I Youve got as much room as I have

I shall tumble if you crowd me

Go ahead and tumble then There is plenty of room in the sea

From one father to another ceremoniously

Pardon me but Im afraid I shoved your wife off the rock last night

Dont mention it I remember I shoved off your wifes mother last
year

We walked among the tiny whitewashed lowroofed cots each with its
silverskinned fishes tacked invitingly against the doorframe to dry
until we came to my favourite the corner cottage in the row It has
beautiful narrow garden strips in frontsolid patches of colour in
sweet gillyflower bushes from which the kindly housewife plucked a
nosegay for us Her white columbines she calls grannys mutches and
indeed they are not unlike those fresh white caps Dear Robbie Burns
ten inches high in plaster stands in the sunny window in a tiny box of
blossoming plants surrounded by a miniature green picket fence Outside
looming white among the gillyflowers is Sir Walter and near him is
still another and a larger bust on a cracked pedestal a foot high
perhaps We did not recognise the head at once and asked the little
woman who it was

Homer the graund Greek poet she answered cheerily an Im to have
anither o Burns as tall as Homer when my daughter comes hame frae
Enbro

If the shade of Homer keeps account of his earthly triumphs I think he
is proud of his place in that humble Scotchwomans gillyflower garden
with his head under the drooping petals of grannys white mutches

What do you think her mon is called in the village John o Mary But
he is not alone in his meekness for there are Jock o Meg Willie
o Janet Jem o Tibby and a dozen others These primitive
fishingvillages are the places where all the advanced women ought
to congregate for the wife is head of the house the accountant the
treasurer the auditor the chancellor of the exchequer and though
her husband does catch the fish for her to sell that is accounted
apparently as a detail too trivial for notice

When we passed Marys cottage on our way to the sands next day Burnss
head had been accidentally broken off by the children and we felt as
though we had lost a friend but Scotch thrift and loyalty to the
dear Ploughman Poet came to the rescue and when we returned Roberts
plaster head had been glued to his body He smiled at us again from
between the two scarlet geraniums and a tendril of ivy had been gently
curled about his neck to hide the cruel wound

After such long lovely mornings as this there is a late luncheon under
the shadow of a rock with Salemina and Francesca an idle chat or the
chapter of a book and presently Lady Ardmore and her daughter Elizabeth
drive down to the sands They are followed by Robin Anstruther Jamie
and Ralph on bicycles and before long the stalwart figure of Ronald
Macdonald appears in the distance just in time for a cup of tea which
we brew in Lady Ardmores bathhouse on the beach



Chapter XIX Fowk o Fife



 To you I sing in simple Scottish lays
 The lowly train in lifes sequesterd scene
 The native feelings strong the guileless ways

The Cotters Saturday Night



We have lived in Pettybaw a very short time but I see that we have
already made an impression upon all grades of society This was not our
intention We gave Edinburgh as our last place of residence with the
view of concealing our nationality until such time as we should choose
to declare it that is when public excitement with regard to our
rental of the house in the loaning should have lapsed into a state of
indifference And yet modest economical and commonplace as has been
the administration of our affairs our method of life has evidently
been thought unusual and our conduct not precisely the conduct of other
summer visitors Even our daily purchases in manner in number and in
character seem to be looked upon as eccentric for whenever we leave a
shop the relatives of the greengrocer flesher draper whoever it may
be bound downstairs surround him in an eager circle and inquire the
latest news

In an unwise moment we begged the drapers wife to honour us with
a visit and explain the obliquities of the kitchen range and the
tortuosities of the sinkspout to Miss Grieve While our landlady was
on the premises I took occasion to invite her up to my own room with a
view of seeing whether my mattress of pebbles and ironfilings could
be supplemented by another of shavings or straw or some material less
provocative of bodily injuries She was most sympathetic persuasive
logical and after the manner of her kind proved to me conclusively that
the trouble lay with the toosaft occupant of the bed not with the
bed itself and gave me statistics with regard to the latter which
established its reputation and at the same moment destroyed my own

She looked in at the various doors casually as she passed up and down
the stairsall save that of the diningroom which Francesca had
prudently locked to conceal the fact that we had covered the family
portraitsand I noticed at the time that her face wore an expression
of mingled grief and astonishment It seemed to us afterward that there
was a good deal more passing up and down the loaning than when we first
arrived At dusk especially small processions of children and young
people walked by our cottage and gave shy glances at the windows

Finding Miss Grieve in an unusually amiable mood I inquired the
probable cause of this phenomenon She would not go so far as to give
any judicial opinion but offered a few conjectures

It might be the tirlingpin it might be the white satin ribbons on the
curtains it might be the guitars and banjos it might be the bicycle
crate it might be the profusion of plants it might be the continual
feasting and revelry it might be the blazing fires in a Pettybaw
summer She thought a much more likely reason however was because
it had become known in the village that we had moved every stick
of furniture in the house out of its accustomed place and taken the
dressingtables away from the windowsthe windys she called them

I discussed this matter fully with Mr Macdonald later on He laughed
heartily but confessed with an amused relish of his national
conservatism that to his mind there certainly was something radical
advanced and courageous in taking a dressingtable away from its place
back to the window and putting it anywhere else in a room He would be
frank he said and acknowledge that it suggested an undisciplined and
lawless habit of thought a disregard for authority a lack of reverence
for tradition and a riotous and unbridled imagination

This view of the matter gave us exquisite enjoyment

But why I asked laughingly The dressingtable is not a sacred
object even to a woman Why treat it with such veneration Where there
is but one good light and that immediately in front of the window
there is every excuse for the British custom but when the light is well
diffused why not place the table whereever it looks well

Ah but it doesnt look well anywhere but back to the window said Mr
Macdonald artlessly It belongs there you see it has probably been
there since the time of Malcolm Canmore unless Margaret was too pious
to look in a mirror With your national love of change you cannot
conceive how soothing it is to know that whenever you enter your gate
and glance upward you will always see the curtains parted and between
them like an idol in a shrine the ugly wooden back of a little oval
or oblong lookingglass It gives one a sense of permanence in a world
where all is fleeting

The public interest in our doings seems to be entirely of a friendly
nature and if our neighbours find a hundredth part of the charm and
novelty in us that we find in them they are fortunate indeed and we
cheerfully sacrifice our privacy on the altar of the public good

A village in Scotland is the only place I can fancy where housekeeping
becomes an enthralling occupation All drudgery disappears in a rosy
glow of unexpected unique and stimulating conditions I would rather
superintend Miss Grieve and cause the light of amazement to gleam
ten times daily in her humid eye than lead a cotillion with Willie
Beresford I would rather do the marketing for our humble breakfasts and
teas or talk over the days luncheons and dinners with Mistress Brodie
of the Pettybaw Inn and Posting Establishment than go to the opera

Salemina and Francesca do not enjoy it all quite as intensely as I so
they considerately give me the lions share Every morning after an
exhilarating interview with the Niobe of our kitchen who thinks me
irresponsible and prays Heaven in her heart I be no worse I put on
my goloshes take my umbrella and trudge up and down the little streets
and lanes on real and if need be imaginary errands The Duke of
Wellington said When fair in Scotland always carry an umbrella
when it rains please yourself and I sometimes agree with Stevensons
shivering statement Life does not seem to me to be an amusement
adapted to this climate I quoted this to the doctor yesterday but he
remarked with some surprise that he had not missed a days golfing for
weeks The chemist observed as he handed me a cake of soap Wonerful
blest in weather we are mam simply because the rain being
unaccompanied with high wind one was enabled to hold up an umbrella
without having it turned inside out When it ceased dripping for an
hour at noon the greengrocer said cheerily Another grand day mam
I assented though I could not for the life of me remember when the last
one occurred However dreary as the weather may be one cannot be dull
when doing ones morning round of shopping in Pettybaw or Strathdee I
have only to give you thumbnail sketches of our favourite tradespeople
to convince you of that fact

    

We bought our first groceries of Mrs Robert Phin of Strathdee simply
because she is an inimitable conversationalist She is expansive too
about family matters and tells us certain of her mons faults which
it would be more seemly to keep in the safe shelter of her own bosom

Rab takes a wee drappie too much it appears and takes it so often that
he has little time to earn an honest penny for his family This is bad
enough but the fact that Mrs Phin has been twice wed before and that
in each case she innocently chose a neerdoweel for a mate makes
her a trifle cynical She told me that she had laid twa husbands in the
kirkyard near which her little shop stands and added cheerfully as
I made some sympathetic response An I hope itll no be lang afore I
box Rab

Salemina objects to the shop because it is so disorderly Soap and
sugar tea and bloaters starch and gingham lead pencils and sausages
lie side by side cosily Boxes of pins are kept on top of kegs of
herrings Tins of coffee are distributed impartially anywhere and
everywhere and the bacon sometimes reposes in a glass case with
smallwares and findings out of the reach of Alexanders dogs

Alexander is one of a brood or perhaps I should say three broods of
children which wander among the barrels and boxes and hams and winceys
seeking what they may devoura handful of sugar a prune or a
sweetie

We often see the bairns at their luncheon or dinner in a little room
just off the shop Alexander the Small always sitting or kneeling on a
creepie holding his plate down firmly with the left hand and eating
with the right whether the food be fish porridge or broth In the
Phin family the person who does not hold his plate down runs the risk of
losing it to one of the other children or to the dogs who with eager
eye and reminding paw gather round the hospitable board licking their
chops hopefully

I enjoy these scenes very much but alas I can no longer witness them
as often as formerly

This morning Mrs Phin greeted me with some embarrassment

Maybe yell no ken me she said her usually clear speech a little
blurred Its the teeth Ive mislaid em somewhere I paid far too
much siller for em to wear em ilka day Sometimes I rest em in the
teabox to keep em awa frae the bairns but I canna find em theer
Im thinkin maybe theyll be in the rice but Ive been ower thrang to
luik

This anecdote was too rich to keep to myself but its unconscious humour
made no impression upon Salemina who insisted upon the withdrawal of
our patronage I have tried to persuade her that whatever may be said
of tea and rice we run no risk in buying eggs but she is relentless

    

The kirkyard where Rabs two predecessors have been laid and where Rab
will lie when Mrs Phin has boxed him is a sleepy little place set on
a gentle slope of ground softly shaded by willow and yew trees It is
enclosed by a stone wall into which an occasional ancient tombstone
is built its name and date almost obliterated by stress of time and
weather

We often walk through its quiet myrtlebordered paths on our way to
the other end of the village where Mrs Bruce the flesher keeps an
unrivalled assortment of beef and mutton The headstones many of them
laid flat upon the graves are interesting to us because of their quaint
inscriptions in which the occupation of the deceased is often stated
with modest pride and candour One expects to see the achievements of
the soldier the sailor or the statesman carved in the stone that marks
his restingplace but to our eyes it is strange enough to read that the
subject of eulogy was a plumber tobacconist maker of golfballs or
a golf champion in which latter case there is a spirited etching
or basrelief of the dead hero with knickerbockers cap and clubs
complete

There too lies Thomas Loughead Hairdresser a profession far too
little celebrated in song and story His stone is a simple one and
bears merely the touching tribute

 He was lovely and pleasant in his life

the inference being to one who knows a line of Scripture that in his
death he was not divided

These kirkyard personalities almost lead one to believe in the
authenticity of the British tradesmans epitaph wherein his
practicalminded relict stated that the bereaved widow would continue
to carry on the tripe and trotter business at the old stand

    

One day when we were walking through the little village of Strathdee
we turned the corner of a quiet side street and came suddenly upon
something altogether strange and unexpected

A stone cottage of the everyday sort stood a trifle back from the road
and bore over its front door a sign announcing that Mrs Bruce Flesher
carried on her business within and indeed one could look through
the windows and see ruddy joints hanging from beams and piles of
pinkandwhite steaks and chops lying neatly on the counter crying
Come eat me Nevertheless ones first glance would be arrested
neither by Mrs Bruces blackandgold sign nor by the enticements of
her stockintrade because ones attention is rapped squarely between
the eyes by an astonishing shape that arises from the patch of lawn
in front of the cottage and completely dominates the scene Imagine
yourself face to face with the last thing you would expect to see in
a modest front dooryardthe figurehead of a ship heroic in size
gorgeous in colour majestic in pose A female personage it appears to
be from the drapery which is the only key the artist furnishes as to
sex and a queenly female withal for she wears a crown at least a foot
high and brandishes a forbidding sceptre All this seen from the front
but the rear view discloses the fact that the lady terminates in the
tail of a fish which wriggles artistically in midair and is of a
brittle sort as it has evidently been thrice broken and glued together

Mrs Bruce did not leave us long in suspense but obligingly came out
partly to comment on the low price of mutton and partly to tell the
tale of the mammoth mermaid By rights of course Mrs Bruces husband
should have been the gallant captain of a bark which foundered at sea
and sent every man to his grave on the oceanbed The ships figurehead
should have been discovered by some miracle brought to the sorrowing
widow and set up in the garden in eternal remembrance of the dear
departed This was the story in my mind but as a matter of fact the
rude effigy was wrought by Mrs Bruces father for a ship to be called
the Sea Queen but by some mischance ship and figurehead never came
together and the old woodcarver left it to his daughter in lieu of
other property It has not been wholly unproductive Mrs Bruce fancies
for the casual passersby like those who came to scoff and remained
to pray go into the shop to ask questions about the Sea Queen and buy
chops out of courtesy and gratitude

    

On our way to the bakery which is a daily walk with us we always
glance at a little cot in a grassy lane just off the fore street In
one half of this humble dwelling Mrs Davidson keeps a slender stock of
shopworn articlespins needles threads sealingwax pencils and
sweeties for the children all disposed attractively upon a single shelf
behind the window

Across the passage close to the other window sits day after day an old
woman of eightsix summers who has lost her kinship with the present and
gone back to dwell for ever in the past A small table stands in front
of her rushbottomed chair the old family Bible rests upon it and in
front of the Bible are always four tiny dolls with which the trembling
old fingers play from morning till night They are cheap common little
puppets but she robes and disrobes them with tenderest care They are
put to bed upon the Bible take their walks along its timeworn pages
are married on it buried on it and the direst punishment they ever
receive is to be removed from its sacred covers and temporarily hidden
beneath the dear old souls black alpaca apron She is quite happy with
her treasures on weekdays but on Sundaysalas and alas the poor old
dame sits in her lonely chair with the furtive tears dropping on her
wrinkled cheeks for it is a Godfearing household and it is neither
lawful nor seemly to play with dolls on the Sawbath

    

Mrs Nicolson is the presiding genius of the bakery she is moreshe
is the bakery itself A Mr Nicolson there is and he is known to be the
baker but he dwells in the regions below the shop and only issues at
rare intervals beneath the friendly shelter of a huge tin tray filled
with scones and baps

If you saw Mrs Nicolsons kitchen with the firelight gleaming on its
bright copper its polished candlesticks and its snowy floor you would
think her an admirable housewife but you would get no clue to those
shrewd and masterful traits of character which reveal themselves chiefly
behind the counter

Miss Grieve had purchased of Mrs Nicolson a quarter section of very
appetising gingercake to eat with our afternoon tea and I stepped in
to buy more She showed me a large round loaf for two shillings

No I objected I cannot use a whole loaf thank you We eat very
little at a time and like it perfectly fresh I wish a small piece such
as my maid bought the other day

Then ensued a discourse which I cannot render in the vernacular mores
the pity though I understood it all too well for my comfort The
substance of it was this that she couldna and wouldna tak it in hand
to give me a quarter section of cake when the other threequarters might
gae dry in the bakery that the reason she sold the small piece on the
former occasion was that her daughter her soninlaw and their three
children came from Ballahoolish to visit her and she gave them a
high tea with no expense spared that at this function they devoured
threefourths of a gingercake and just as she was mournfully regarding
the remainder my servant came in and took it off her hands that she had
kept a bakery for thirty years and her mother before her and never had
a twoshilling gingercake been sold in pieces before nor was it likely
ever to occur again that if I under Providence so to speak had been
the fortunate gainer by the transaction why not eat my six pennyworth
in solemn gratitude once for all and not expect a like miracle to
happen the next week And finally that twoshilling gingercakes were
in the very nature of things designed for large families and it
was the part of wisdom for small families to fix their affections on
something else for she couldna and wouldna tak it in hand to cut a
rare and expensive article for a small customer

The torrent of logic was over and I said humbly that I would take the
whole loaf

Verra weel mam she responded more affably thank you kindly no I
couldna tak it in hand to sell six pennyworth of that gingercake and
let oneandsixpence worth gae dry in the bakeryA beautiful day mam
Wonerful blest in weather ye are Let me open your umbrella for you
mam

    

David Robb is the weaver of Pettybaw All day long he sits at his
oldfashioned handloom which like the fruit of his toil and the dear
old greybeard himself belongs to a day that is past and gone

He might have work enough to keep an apprentice busy but where would
he find a lad sufficiently behind the times to learn a humble trade now
banished to the limbo of superseded almost forgotten things

His home is but a poor place but the rough room in which he works is
big enough to hold a deal of sweet content It is cheery enough too
to attract the Pettybaw weans who steal in on wet days and sit on the
floor playing with the thrums or with bits of coloured ravellings
Sometimes when they have proved themselves wise and prudent little
virgins they are even allowed to touch the hanks of pink and yellow and
blue yarn that lie in rainbowhued confusion on the long deal table

All this time the heddles go up and down up and down with their
ceaseless clatter and David throws the shuttle back and forth as he
weaves his oldfashioned winceys

We have grown to be good friends David and I and I have been permitted
the signal honour of painting him at his work

The loom stands by an eastern window and the rare Pettybaw sunshine
filters through the branches of a tree shines upon the dusty
windowpanes and throws a halo round Davids head that he well deserves
and little suspects In my foreground sit Meg and Jean and Elspeth
playing with thrums and wearing the fruit of Davids loom in their
gingham frocks David himself sits on his wooden bench behind the maze
of cords that form the loom harness

The snows of seventy winters powder his hair and beard His spectacles
are often pushed back on his kindly brow but no glass could wholly
obscure the clear integrity and steadfast purity of his eyes and as
for his smile I have not the art to paint that It holds in solution so
many sweet though humble virtues of patience temperance selfdenial
honest endeavour that my brush falters in the attempt to fix the
radiant whole upon the canvas Fashions come and go modern improvements
transform the arts and trades manual skill gives way to the cunning of
the machine but old David Robb after more than fifty years of toil
still sits at his handloom and weaves his winceys for the Pettybaw
bairnies

David has small booklearning so he tells me and indeed he had need to
tell me for I should never have discovered it myselfone misses it so
little when the larger things are all present

A certain summer visitor in Pettybaw a compatriot of ours by the way
bought a quantity of Davids orangecoloured wincey and finding that it
wore like iron wished to order more She used the word reproduce
in her telegram as there was one pattern and one colour she specially
liked Perhaps the context was not illuminating but at any rate the
word reproduce was not in Davids vocabulary and putting back his
spectacles he told me his difficulty in deciphering the exact meaning of
his finelady patron He called at the Free Kirk mansethe meenister
was no at hame then to the libraryit was closed then to the
Estaiblished mansethe meenister was awa At last he obtained a
glance at the schoolmasters dictionary and turning to reproduce
found that it meant nought but mak ower againand with an amused
smile at the bedevilments of language he turned once more to his loom
and I to my canvas

Notwithstanding his unfamiliarity with langnebbit words David has
absorbed a deal of wisdom in his quiet life though so far as I can see
his only books have been the green tree outside his window a glimpse of
the distant ocean and the toil of his hands

But I sometimes question if as many scholars are not made as marred in
this wise forto the seeing eyethe waving leaf and the far sea the
daily task ones own heartbeats and ones neighboursthese teach
us in good time to interpret Natures secrets and mans and Gods as
well



Chapter XX A Fifeshire teaparty



 The knights they harpit in their bowr
 The ladyes sewd and sang
 The mirth that was in that chamber
 Through all the place it rang

Rose the Red and White Lily



Tea at Rowardennan Castle is an impressive and a delightful function
It is served by a ministeriallooking butler and a
justreadytobeordained footman They both look as if they had been
nourished on the ThirtyNine Articles but they know their business as
well as if they had been trained in heathen landswhich is saying a
good deal for everybody knows that heathen servants wait upon one
with idolatrous solicitude However from the quality of the cheering
beverage itself down to the thickness of the cream the thinness of the
china the crispness of the toast and the plummyness of the cake tea
at Rowardennan Castle is perfect in every detail

The scones are of unusual lightness also I should think they would
scarcely weigh more than four perhaps even five to a pound but I am
aware that the casual traveller who eats only at hotels and never has
the privilege of entering feudal castles will be slow to believe this
estimate particularly just after breakfast

Salemina always describes a Scotch scone as an aspiring but unsuccessful
sodabiscuit of the New England sort Stevenson in writing of that
dense black substance inimical to life called Scotch bun says that
the patriotism that leads a Scotsman to eat it will hardly desert him in
any emergency Salemina thinks that the scone should be bracketed with
the bun in description of course never in the human stomach and
says that as a matter of fact th unconquerd Scot of old was not
only clad in a shirt of mail but well fortified within when he went
forth to warfare after a meal of oatmeal and scones She insists that
the spear which would pierce the shirt of mail would be turned aside
and blunted by the ordinary scone of commerce but what signifies the
opinion of a woman who eats sugar on her porridge

Considering the air of liberal hospitality that hangs about the castle
teatable I wonder that our friends do not oftener avail themselves
of its privileges and allow us to do so but on all dark foggy or
inclement days or whenever they tire of the sands everybody persists
in taking tea at BideaWee Cottage

We buy our tea of the Pettybaw grocer some of our cups are cracked
the teapot is of earthenware Miss Grieve disapproves of all social
teafuddles and shows it plainly when she brings in the tray and the
room is so small that some of us overflow into the hall or the garden
it matters not there is some fatal charm in our humble hospitality
At four oclock one of us is obliged to be like Sister Anne on the
housetop and if company approaches she must descend and speed to
the plumbers for six pennyworth extra of cream In most wellordered
British households Miss Grieve would be requested to do this speeding
but both her mind and her body move too slowly for such domestic crises
and then too her temper has to be kept as unruffled as possible so
that she will cut the bread and butter thin This she generally does if
she has not been fair dounhadden wi wark but the washing of her
own spinster cup and plate together with the incident sighs and groans
occupies her till so late an hour that she is not always dressed for
callers

Willie and I were reading The Lady of the Lake the other day in the
back garden surrounded by the verdant leafage of our own kaleyard
It is a pretty spot when the sun shines a trifle domestic in its air
perhaps but restful Miss Grieves dishtowels and aprons drying on the
currant bushes the cat playing with a muttonbone or a fishtail on the
grass and the little birds perching on the rims of our washboiler
and waterbuckets It can be reached only by way of the kitchen which
somewhat lessens its value as a pleasureground or a rustic retreat but
Willie and I retire there now and then for a quiet chat

On this particular occasion Willie was declaiming the exciting verses
where FitzJames and Murdoch are crossing the stream

 That joins Loch Katrine to Achray

where the crazed Blanche of Devan first appears

 All in the Trosachs glen was still
 Noontide was sleeping on the hill
 Sudden his guide whoopd loud and high
 Murdoch was that a signal cry

It was indeed said Francesca appearing suddenly at an upper window
overhanging the garden Pardon this intrusion but the Castle people
are here she continued in what is known as a stage whisperthat is
one that can be easily heard by a thousand personsthe Castle people
and the ladies from Pettybaw House and Mr Macdonald is coming down the
loaning but Calamity Jane is making her toilet in the kitchen and you
cannot take Mr Beresford through into the sittingroom at present She
says this hoose has so few conveniences that its fair sickenin

How long will she be queried Mr Beresford anxiously putting The
Lady of the Lake in his pocket and pacing up and down between the rows
of cabbages

She has just begun Whatever you do dont unsettle her temper for
she will have to prepare for eight today I will send Mr Macdonald and
Miss Macrae to the bakery for gingerbread to gain time and possibly
I can think of a way to rescue you If I cant are you tolerably
comfortable Perhaps Miss Grieve wont mind Penelope and she can come
through the kitchen any time and join us but naturally you dont want
to be separated thats the worst of being engaged Of course I can
lower your tea in a tin bucket and if it should rain I can throw out
umbrellas Would you like your golfcaps Pen Wonerful blest in
weather ye are mam The situation is not so bad as it might be she
added consolingly because in case Miss Grieves toilet should last
longer than usual your wedding need not be indefinitely postponed for
Mr Macdonald can marry you from this window

Here she disappeared and we had scarcely time to take in the full
humour of the affair before Robin Anstruthers laughing eyes appeared
over the top of the high brick wall that protects our garden on three
sides

Do not shoot said he I am not come to steal the fruit but to
succour humanity in distress Miss Monroe insisted that I should borrow
the inn ladder She thought a rescue would be much more romantic than
waiting for Miss Grieve Everybody is coming out to witness it at least
all your gueststhere are no strangers presentand Miss Monroe is
already collecting sixpence a head for the entertainment to be given
she says for your dear Friars sustenation fund

He was now astride of the wall and speedily lifted the ladder to our
side where it leaned comfortably against the stout branches of the
drapers peach vine Willie ran nimbly up the ladder and bestrode the
wall I followed first standing and then decorously sitting down on
the top of it Mr Anstruther pulled up the ladder and replaced it on
the side of liberty then he descended then Willie and I last of all
amidst the acclamations of the onlookers a select company of six or
eight persons

When Miss Grieve formally entered the sittingroom bearing the teatray
she was buskit braw in black stuff gown clean apron and fresh cap
trimmed with purple ribbons under which her white locks were neatly
dressed

She deplored the coolness of the tea but accounted for it to me in
an aside by the sickening quality of Mrs Sinklers coals and Mr
Macbroses kindlingwood to say nothing of the insulting draft in the
drapers range When she left the room I suppose she was unable to
explain the peals of laughter that rang through our circumscribed halls

Lady Ardmore insists that the rescue was the most unique episode she
ever witnessed and says that she never understood America until
she made our acquaintance I persuaded her that this was fallacious
reasoning that while she might understand us by knowing America she
could not possibly reverse this mental operation and be sure of the
result The ladies of Pettybaw House said that the occurrence was as
Fifish as anything that ever happened in Fife The kingdom of Fife is
noted it seems for its doocots dovecots and its daft lairds
and to be eccentric and Fifish are one and the same thing Thereupon
Francesca told Mr Macdonald a story she heard in Edinburgh to the
effect that when a certain committee or council was quarrelling as
to which of certain Fifeshire towns should be the seat of a projected
lunatic asylum a new resident arose and suggested that the building of
a wall round the kingdom of Fife would solve the difficulty settle
all disputes and give sufficient room for the lunatics to exercise
properly

This is the sort of tale that a native can tell with a genial chuckle
but it comes with poor grace from an American lady sojourning in Fife
Francesca does not mind this however as she is at present avenging
fresh insults to her own beloved country



Chapter XXI International bickering



 With mimic din of stroke and ward
 The broadsword upon target jarrd

The Lady of the Lake



Robin Anstruther was telling stories at the teatable

I got acquainted with an American girl in rather a queer sort of
way he said between cups It was in London on the Duke of Yorks
weddingday Im rather a tall chap you see and in the crowd somebody
touched me on the shoulder and a plaintive voice behind me said
Youre such a big man and I am so little will you please help me to
save my life My mother was separated from me in the crowd somewhere as
we were trying to reach the Berkeley and I dont know what to do
I was a trifle nonplussed but I did the best I could She was a tiny
thing in a marvellous frock and a flowery hat and a silver girdle and
chatelaine In another minute she spied a second man an officer a full
head taller than I am broad shoulders splendidly put up altogether
Bless me if she didnt turn to him and say Oh youre so nice and
big youre even bigger than this other gentleman and I need you both
in this dreadful crush If youll be good enough to stand on either
side of me I shall be awfully obliged We exchanged amused glances
of embarrassment over her blonde head but there was no resisting the
irresistible She was a small person but she had the soul of a general
and we obeyed orders We stood guard over her little ladyship for nearly
an hour and I must say she entertained us thoroughly for she was as
clever as she was pretty Then I got her a seat in one of the windows of
my club while the other man armed with a full description went out to
hunt up the mother and by Jove he found her too She would have her
mother and her mother she had They were awfully jolly people they
came to luncheon in my chambers at the Albany afterwards and we grew to
be great friends

I dare say she was an English girl masquerading I remarked
facetiously What made you think her an American

Oh her general appearance and accent I suppose

Probably she didnt say Barkley observed Francesca cuttingly she
would have been sure to commit that sort of solecism

Why dont you say Barkley in the States

Certainly not we never call them the States and with us clerk
spells clerk and Berk Berk

How very odd remarked Mr Anstruther

No odder than you saying Bark and not half as odd as your calling it
Albany I interpolated to help Francesca

Quite so said Mr Anstruther but how do you say Albany in America

Penelope and I always call it Allbany responded Francesca
nonsensically but Salemina who has been much in England always calls
it Albany

This anecdote was the signal for Miss Ardmore to remark apropos of her
own discrimination and the American accent that hearing a lady ask for
a certain medcine in a chemists shop she noted the intonation and
inquired of the chemist when the fair stranger had retired if she
were not an American And she was exclaimed the Honourable Elizabeth
triumphantly And what makes it the more curious she had been over
here twenty years and of course spoke English quite properly

In avenging fancied insults it is certainly more just to heap
punishment on the head of the real offender than upon his neighbour
and it is a trifle difficult to decide why Francesca should chastise Mr
Macdonald for the goodhumoured sins of Mr Anstruther and Miss Ardmore
yet she does so nevertheless

The history of these chastisements she recounts in the nightly halfhour
which she spends with me when I am endeavouring to compose myself for
sleep Francesca is fluent at all times but once seated on the foot of
my bed she becomes eloquent

It all began with his saying

This is her perennial introduction and I respond as invariably What
began

Oh todays argument with Mr Macdonald It was a literary quarrel
this afternoon

Fools rush in I quoted

There is a good deal of nonsense in that old saw she interrupted at
all events the most foolish fools I have ever known stayed still and
didnt do anything Rushing shows a certain movement of the mind
even if it is in the wrong direction However Mr Macdonald is both
opinionated and dogmatic but his worst enemy could never call him a
fool

I didnt allude to Mr Macdonald

Dont you suppose I know to whom you alluded dear Is not your style
so simple frank and direct that a wayfaring girl can read it and not
err therein No I am not sitting on your feet and it is not time to go
to sleep I wonder you do not tire of making those futile protests As a
matter of fact we began this literary discussion yesterday morning
but were interrupted and knowing that it was sure to come up again
I prepared for it with Salemina She furnished the ammunition so to
speak and I fired the guns

You always make so much noise with blank cartridges I wonder you ever
bother about real shot I remarked

Penelope how can you abuse me when I am in trouble Well Mr
Macdonald was prating as usual about the antiquity of Scotland and its
aeons of stirring history I am so weary of the venerableness of this
country How old will it have to be I wonder before it gets used
to it If its the province of art to conceal art it ought to be the
province of age to conceal age and it generally is Everything doesnt
improve with years I observed sententiously

For instance he inquired

Of course you know how that question affected me How I do dislike
an appetite for specific details It is simply paralysing to a good
conversation Do you remember that silly game in which some one points
a stick at you and says Beast bird or fishBEAST and you have
to name one while he counts ten If a beast has been requested you can
think of one fish and two birds but no beast If he says FISH all
the beasts in the universe stalk through your memory but not one finny
sealy swimming thing Well that is the effect of For instance on my
faculties So I stumbled a bit and succeeded in recalling as objects
which do not improve with age mushrooms women and chickens and he
was obliged to agree with me which nearly killed him Then I said that
although America is so fresh and blooming that people persist in calling
it young it is much older than it appears to the superficial eye There
is no real propriety in dating us as a nation from the Declaration of
Independence in 1776 I said nor even from the landing of the Pilgrims
in 1620 nor for that matter from Columbuss discovery in 1492 Its
my opinion I asserted that some of us had been there thousands of
years before but nobody had had the sense to discover us We couldnt
discover ourselvesthough if we could have foreseen how the sere and
yellow nations of the earth would taunt us with youth and inexperience
we should have had to do something desperate

That theory must have been very convincing to the philosophic Scots
mind I interjected

It was even Mr Macdonald thought it ingenious And so I went on
we were alive and awake and beginning to make history when you Scots
were only barelegged savages roaming over the hills and stealing
cattle It was a very bad habit of yours that cattlestealing and one
which you kept up too long

No worse a sin than your stealing land from the Indians he said

Oh yes I answered because it was a smaller one Yours was a vice
and ours a sin or I mean it would have been a sin had we done it but
in reality we didnt steal land we just TOOK it reserving plenty for
the Indians to play about on and for every huntingground we took away
we gave them in exchange a serviceable plough or a school or a nice
Indian agent or something That was landgrabbing if you like but
it is a habit you Britishers have still while we gave it up when we
reached years of discretion

This is very illuminating I interrupted now thoroughly wide awake
but it isnt my idea of a literary discussion

I am coming to that she responded It was just at this point that
goaded into secret fury by my innocent speech about cattlestealing he
began to belittle American literature the poetry especially Of course
he waxed eloquent about the royal line of poetkings that had made his
country famous and said the people who could claim Shakespeare had
reason to be the proudest nation on earth Doubtless I said But do
you mean to say that Scotland has any nearer claim upon Shakespeare than
we have I do not now allude to the fact that in the large sense he is
the common property of the Englishspeaking world Salemina told me to
say that but Shakespeare died in 1616 and the union of Scotland with
England didnt come about till 1707 nearly a century afterwards You
really havent anything to do with him But as for us we didnt leave
England until 1620 when Shakespeare had been perfectly dead four years
We took very good care not to come away too soon Chaucer and Spenser
were dead too and we had nothing to stay for

I was obliged to relax here and give vent to a burst of merriment at
Francescas absurdities

I could see that he had never regarded the matter in that light
before she went on gaily encouraged by my laughter but he braced
himself for the conflict and said I wonder that you didnt stay a
little longer while you were about it Milton and Ben Jonson were still
alive Bacons Novum Organum was just coming out and in thirty or forty
years you could have had LAllegro Il Penseroso and Paradise Lost
Newtons Principia too in 1687 Perhaps these were all too serious and
heavy for your national taste still one sometimes likes to claim things
one cannot fully appreciate And then too if you had once begun to
stay waiting for the great things to happen and the great books to
be written you would never have gone for there would still have been
Browning Tennyson and Swinburne to delay you

If we couldnt stay to see out your great bards we certainly couldnt
afford to remain and welcome your minor ones I answered frigidly but
we wanted to be well out of the way before England united with Scotland
knowing that if we were uncomfortable as things were it would be a good
deal worse after the Union and we had to come home anyway and start
our own poets Emerson Whittier Longfellow Holmes and Lowell had to
be born

I suppose they had to be if you had set your mind on it he said
though personally I could have spared one or two on that roll of
honour

Very probably I remarked as thoroughly angry now as he intended I
should be We cannot expect you to appreciate all the American poets
indeed you cannot appreciate all of your own for the same nation
doesnt always furnish the writers and the readers Take your precious
Browning for example There are hundreds of Browning Clubs in America
and I never heard of a single one in Scotland

No he retorted I dare say but there is a good deal in belonging
to a people who can understand him without clubs

O Francesca I exclaimed sitting bolt upright among my pillows How
could you give him that chance How COULD you What did you say

I said nothing she replied mysteriously I did something much more
to the pointI cried

CRIED

Yes cried not rivers and freshets of woe but small brooks and
streamlets of helpless mortification

What did he do then

Why do you say do

Oh I mean say of course Dont trifle go on What did he say
then

There are some things too dreadful to describe she answered and
wrapping her Italian blanket majestically about her she retired to her
own apartment shooting one enigmatical glance at me as she closed the
door

That glance puzzled me for some time after she left the room It was as
expressive and interesting a beam as ever darted from a womans eye
The combination of elements involved in it if an abstract thing may be
conceived as existing in component parts was something like this

Onehalf mystery Oneeighth triumph Oneeighth amusement
Onesixteenth pride Onesixteenth shame Onesixteenth desire to
confess Onesixteenth determination to conceal

And all these delicate complex emotions played together in a circle
of arching eyebrow curving lip and tremulous chinplayed together
mingling and melting into one another like fire and snow bewildering
mystifying enchanting the beholder

If Ronald Macdonald didI am a woman but for one I can hardly blame
him



Chapter XXII Francesca entertains the greeneyed monster



 O has he chosen a bonny bride
 An has he clean forgotten me
 An sighing said that gay ladye
 I would I were in my ain countrie

Lord Beichan



It rained in torrents Salemina was darning stockings in the inglenook
at BideaWee Cottage and I was reading her a Scotch letter which
Francesca and I had concocted the evening before I proposed sending the
document to certain chosen spirits in our own country who were pleased
to be facetious concerning our devotion to Scotland It contained in
sooth little that was new and still less that was true for we were
confined to a very small vocabulary which we were obliged to supplement
now and then by a dip into Burns and Allan Ramsay

Here is the letter

BideaWee Cottage Pettybaw
East Neuk o Fife


To my trusty fieres

Monys the time I hae ettled to send ye a screed but there was aye
something that cam i the gait It wisna that I couldna be fashed for
aften hae I thocht o ye and my hairt has been wi ye monys the day
Theres no muckle fowk frae Ameriky hereawa theyre a jist Fife

Yestreen was a calm simmer gloamin sae sweet an bonnie that when the

As we cam through the scented birks we saw a trottin burnie wimplin
neath the whiteblossomed slaes and hirplin doon the hillside
an while a herdladdie lilted ower the fernie brae a cushat cooed
leesomely doon i the dale We pit aff oor shoon sae blithe were we

Buchan the fleshers dochter frae Auld Reekie Tibbys nae giglet gawky

Penelope Hamilton


It may be very fine remarked Salemina judicially though I cannot
understand more than half of it

That would also be true of Browning I replied Dont you love to see
great ideas looming through a mist of words

The words are misty enough in this case she said and I do wish you
would not tell the world that I paddle in the burn or twine my bree
wi tasselled broom Im too old to be made ridiculous

Nobody will believe it said Francesca appearing in the doorway
They will know it is only Penelopes havering and with this
undeserved scoff she took her mashie and went golfingnot on the
links on this occasion but in our microscopic sittingroom It is
twelve feet square and holds a tiny piano desk centretable sofa
and chairs but the spot between the fireplace and the table is
Francescas favourite puttinggreen She wishes to become more deadly
in the matter of approaches and thinks her teeshots weak so these two
deficiencies she is trying to make good by home practice in inclement
weather She turns a tumbler on its side on the floor and putts the
ball into it or at it as the case may be from the opposite side
of the room It is excellent discipline and as the tumblers are
inexpensive the breakage really does not matter Whenever Miss Grieve
hears the shivering of glass she murmurs not without reason It is
not for the knowing what they will be doing next

Penelope has it ever occurred to you that Elizabeth Ardmore is
seriously interested in Mr Macdonald

Salemina propounded this question to me with the same innocence that a
babe would display in placing a lighted fuse beside a dynamite bomb

Francesca naturally heard the remarkalthough it was addressed to
mepricked up her ears and missed the tumbler by several feet

It was a simple inquiry but as I look back upon it from the safe ground
of subsequent knowledge I perceive that it had a certain amount of
influence upon Francescas history The suggestion would have carried
no weight with me for two reasons In the first place Salemina is
farsighted If objects are located at some distance from her she sees
them clearly but if they are under her very nose she overlooks them
altogether unless they are sufficiently fragrant or audible to address
other senses This physical peculiarity she carries over into her mental
processes Her impression of the Disruption movement for example would
be lively and distinct but her perception of a contemporary lovers
quarrel particularly if it were fought at her own apronstrings would
be singularly vague If she suggested therefore that Elizabeth Ardmore
was interested in Mr Beresford who is the rightful captive of my bow
and spear I should be perfectly calm

My second reason for comfortable indifference is that frequently in
novels and always in plays the heroine is instigated to violent
jealousy by insinuations of this sort usually conveyed by the villain
of the piece male or female I have seen this happen so often in the
modern drama that it has long since ceased to be convincing but though
Francesca has witnessed scores of plays and read hundreds of novels
it did not apparently strike her as a theatrical or literary suggestion
that Lady Ardmores daughter should be in love with Mr Macdonald The
effect of the new point of view was most salutary on the whole She had
come to think herself the only prominent figure in the Reverend Ronalds
landscape and anything more impertinent than her tone with him unless
it is his with her I certainly never heard This criticism however
relates only to their public performances and I have long suspected
that their private conversations are of a kindlier character When it
occurred to her that he might simply be sharpening his mental sword on
her steel but that his heart had at last wandered into a more genial
climate than she had ever provided for it she softened unconsciously
the Scotsman and the American receded into a truer perspective and the
man and the woman approached each other with dangerous nearness

What shall we do if Francesca and Mr Macdonald really fall in love
with each other asked Salemina when Francesca had gone into the hall
to try long drives There is a good deal of excitement in this as
Miss Grieve has to cross the passage on her way from the kitchen to
the chinacloset and thus often serves as a reluctant hazard or
bunker

Do you mean what should we have done I queried

Nonsense dont be captious It cant be too late yet They have known
each other only a little over two months when would you have had me
interfere pray

It depends upon what you expect to accomplish If you wish to stop
the marriage interfere in a fortnight or so if you wish to prevent
an engagement speakwell say tomorrow if however you didnt wish
them to fall in love with each other you should have kept one of them
away from Lady Bairds dinner

I could have waited a trifle longer than that argued Salemina for
you remember how badly they got on at first

I remember you thought so I responded dryly but I believe Mr
Macdonald has been interested in Francesca from the outset partly
because her beauty and vivacity attracted him partly because he could
keep her in order only by putting his whole mind upon her On his side
he has succeeded in piquing her into thinking of him continually though
solely as she fancies for the purpose of crossing swords with him
If they ever drop their weapons for an instant and allow the din of
warfare to subside so that they can listen to their own heartbeats
they will discover that they love each other to distraction

Ye ken mair thans in the catecheesm remarked Salemina yawning a
little as she put away her darningball It is pathetic to see you
waste your time painting mediocre pictures when as a lecturer upon love
you could instruct your thousands

The thousands would never satisfy me I retorted so long as you
remained uninstructed for in your single person you would so swell the
sum of human ignorance on that subject that my teaching would be for
ever in vain

Very clever indeed Well what will Mr Monroe say to me when I return
to New York without his daughter or with his soninlaw

He has never denied Francesca anything in her life why should he draw
the line at a Scotsman I am much more concerned about Mr Macdonalds
congregation

I am not anxious about that said Salemina loyally Francesca would
be the life of an Inchcaldy parish

I dare say I observed but she might be the death of the pastor

I am ashamed of you Penelope or I should be if you meant what you
say She can make the people love her if she tries when did she ever
fail at that But with Mr Macdonalds talent to say nothing of his
family connections he is sure to get a church in Edinburgh in a few
years if he wishes Undoubtedly it would not be a great match in a
money sense I suppose he has a manse and three or four hundred pounds a
year

That sum would do nicely for cabs

Penelope you are flippant

I dont mean it dear its only for fun and it would be so absurd
if we should leave Francesca over here as the presiding genius of an
Inchcaldy parsonageI mean a manse

It isnt as if she were penniless continued Salemina she has
fortune enough to assure her own independence and not enough to
threaten histhe ideal amount I hardly think the good Lords first
intention was to make her a ministers wife but He knows very well that
Love is a master architect Francesca is full of beautiful possibilities
if Mr Macdonald is the man to bring them out and I am inclined to
think he is

He has brought out impishness so far I objected

The impishness is transitory she returned and I am speaking of
permanent qualities His is the stronger and more serious nature
Francescas the sweeter and more flexible He will be the oaktree and
she will be the sunshine playing in the branches

Salemina dear I said penitently kissing her grey hair I
apologise you are not absolutely ignorant about Love after all when
you call him the master architect and that is very lovely and very true
about the oaktree and the sunshine



Chapter XXIII Ballad revels at Rowardennan



 Love I maun gang to Edinbrugh
 Love I maun gang an leave thee
 She sighed right sair an said nae mair
 But O gin I were wi ye

Andrew Lammie



Jean Dalziel came to visit us a week ago and has put new life into our
little circle I suppose it was playing Sir Patrick Spens that set us
thinking about it for one warm idle day when we were all in the
Glen we began a series of balladrevels in which each of us assumed
a favourite character The choice induced so much argument and
disagreement that Mr Beresford was at last appointed head of the clan
and having announced himself formally as The Mackintosh he was placed
on the summit of a hastily arranged pyramidal cairn He was given an ash
wand and a rowantree sword and then according to ancient custom his
pedigree and the exploits of his ancestors were recounted and he was
exhorted to emulate their example Now it seems that a Highland chief
of the olden time being as absolute in his patriarchal authority as any
prince had a corresponding number of officers attached to his person
He had a bodyguard who fought around him in battle and independent of
this he had a staff of officers who accompanied him wherever he went
These our chief proceeded to appoint as follows

Henchman Ronald Macdonald bard Penelope Hamilton spokesman or fool
Robin Anstruther swordbearer Francesca Monroe piper Salemina
pipers attendant Elizabeth Ardmore baggage gillie Jean Dalziel
running footman Ralph bridle gillie Jamie ford gillie Miss Grieve
The ford gillie carries the chief across fords only and there are no
fords in the vicinity so Mr Beresford not liking to leave a member
of our household out of office thought this the best post for Calamity
Jane

With The Mackintosh on his pyramidal cairn matters went very much
better and at Jamies instigation we began to hold rehearsals for
certain festivities at Rowardennan for as Jamies birthday fell on the
eve of the Queens Jubilee there was to be a gay party at the Castle

All this occurred days ago and yesterday evening the balladrevels came
off and Rowardennan was a scene of great pageant and splendour Lady
Ardmore dressed as the Lady of Inverleith received the guests
and there were all manner of tableaux and ballads in costume and
pantomimes and a grand march by the clan in which we appeared in our
chosen roles

Salemina was Lady Maisryshe whom all the lords of the north countrie
came wooing

 But a that they could say to her
 Her answer still was Na

And again

 O haud your tongues young men she said
 And think nae mair on me

Mr Beresford was Lord Beichan and I was Shusy Pye

 Lord Beichan was a Christian born
 And such resolved to live and dee
 So he was taen by a savage Moor
 Who treated him right cruellie

 The Moor he had an only daughter
 The damsels name was Shusy Pye
 And ilka day as she took the air
 Lord Beichans prison she passd by

Elizabeth Ardmore was Leezie Lindsay who kilted her coats o green
satin to the knee and was aff to the Hielands so expeditiously when her
lover declared himself to be Lord Ronald Macdonald a chieftain of high
degree

Francesca was Mary Ambree

 When captaines couragious whom death cold not daunte
 Did march to the siege of the citty of Gaunt
 They mustred their souldiers by two and by three
 And the foremost in battle was Mary Ambree

 When the brave sergeantmajor was slaine in her sight
 Who was her true lover her joy and delight
 Because he was slaine most treacherouslie
 Then vowd to avenge him Mary Ambree

Brenda Macrae from Pettybaw House was Fairly Fair Jamie Sir Patrick
Spens Ralph King Alexander of Dunfermline Mr Anstruther Bonnie
Glenlogie the flower o them a Mr Macdonald and Miss Dalziel
Young Hynde Horn and the kings daughter Jean respectively

 Oh its Hynde Horn fair and its Hynde Horn free
 Oh where were you born and in what countrie
 In a far distant countrie I was born
 But of home and friends I am quite forlorn

 Oh its seven long years he served the king
 But wages from him he neer got a thing
 Oh its seven long years he served I ween
 And all for love of the kings daughter Jean

It is not to be supposed that all this went off without any of the
difficulties and heartburnings that are incident to things dramatic
When Elizabeth Ardmore chose to be Leezie Lindsay she asked me to sing
the ballad behind the scenes Mr Beresford naturally thought that Mr
Macdonald would take the opposite part in the tableau inasmuch as the
hero bears his name but he positively declined to play Lord Ronald
Macdonald and said it was altogether too personal

Mr Anstruther was rather disagreeable at the beginning and upbraided
Miss Dalziel for offering to be the kings daughter Jean to Mr
Macdonalds Hynde Horn when she knew very well he wanted her for Ladye
Jeanie in Glenlogie She had meantime confided to me that nothing could
induce her to appear in Glenlogie it was far too personal

Mr Macdonald offended Francesca by sending her his castoff gown and
begging her to be Sir Patrick Spens and she was still more gloomy so I
imagined because he had not proffered his six feet of manly beauty for
the part of the captain in Mary Ambree when the only other person to
take it was Jamies tutor He is an Oxford man and a delightful person
but very bowlegged added to that by the time the rehearsals had
ended she had been obliged to beg him to love some one more worthy
than herself and did not wish to appear in the same tableau with him
feeling that it was much too personal

When the eventful hour came yesterday Willie and I were the only
actors really willing to take lovers parts save Jamie and Ralph who
were but too anxious to play all the characters whatever their age
sex colour or relations But the guests knew nothing of these
trivial disagreements and at ten oclock last night it would have been
difficult to match Rowardennan Castle for a scene of beauty and revelry
Everything went merrily till we came to Hynde Horn the concluding
tableau and the most effective and elaborate one on the programme
At the very last moment when the opening scene was nearly ready Jean
Dalziel fell down a secret staircase that led from the tapestry chamber
into Lady Ardmores boudoir where the rest of us were dressing It was
a short flight of steps but as she held a candle and was carrying her
costume she fell awkwardly spraining her wrist and ankle Finding
that she was not maimed for life Lady Ardmore turned with comical and
unsympathetic haste to Francesca so completely do amateur theatricals
dry the milk of kindness in the human breast

Put on these clothes at once she said imperiously knowing nothing of
the volcanoes beneath the surface Hynde Horn is already on the stage
and somebody must be Jean Take care of Miss Dalziel girls and ring
for more maids Helene come and dress Miss Monroe put on her slippers
while I lace her gown run and fetch more jewelsmore stillshe can
carry off any number not any rouge Heleneshe has too much colour
now pull the frock more off the shouldersits a pity to cover an
inch of them pile her hair higherhere take my diamond tiara child
hurry Helene fetch the silver cup and the cakeno they are on the
stage take her train Helene Miss Hamilton run and open the doors
ahead of them please I wont go down for this tableau Ill put Miss
Dalziel right and then Ill slip into the drawingroom to be ready for
the guests when they come in

We hurried breathlessly through an interminable series of rooms and
corridors I gave the signal to Mr Beresford who was nervously waiting
for it in the wings and the curtain went up on Hynde Horn disguised as
the auld beggar man at the kings gate Mr Beresford was reading the
ballad and we took up the tableaux at the point where Hynde Horn has
come from a far countrie to see why the diamonds in the ring given him
by his own true love have grown pale and wan He hears that the kings
daughter Jean has been married to a knight these nine days past

 But unto him a wife the bride winna be
 For love of Hynde Horn far over the sea

He therefore borrows the old beggars garments and hobbles to the kings
palace where he petitions the porter for a cup of wine and a bit of
cake to be handed him by the fair bride herself

 Good porter I pray for Saints Peter and Paul
 And for sake of the Saviour who died for us all
 For one cup of wine and one bit of bread
 To an auld man with travel and hunger bestead

 And ask the fair bride for the sake of Hynde Horn
 To hand them to me so sadly forlorn
 Then the porter for pity the message conveyd
 And told the fair bride all the beggar man said

The curtain went up again The porter moved to pity has gone to give
the message to his lady Hynde Horn is watching the staircase at the
rear of the stage his heart in his eyes The tapestries that hide it
are drawn and there stands the kings daughter who tripped down the
stair

 And in her fair hands did lovingly bear
 A cup of red wine and a farle of cake
 To give the old man for loved Hynde Horns sake

The hero of the ballad who had not seen his true love for seven long
years could not have been more amazed at the change in her than was
Ronald Macdonald at the sight of the flushed excited almost tearful
kings daughter on the staircase Lady Ardmores diamonds flashing from
her crimson satin gown Lady Ardmores rubies glowing on her white
arms and throat not Miss Dalziel as had been arranged but Francesca
rebellious reluctant embarrassed angrily beautiful and beautifully
angry

In the next scene Hynde Horn has drained the cup and dropped the ring
into it

 Oh found you that ring by sea or on land
 Or got you that ring off a dead mans hand
 Oh I found not that ring by sea or on land
 But I got that ring from a fair ladys hand

 As a pledge of true love she gave it to me
 Full seven years ago as I saild oer the sea
 But now that the diamonds are changed in their hue
 I know that my love has to me proved untrue

I never saw a prettier picture of sweet tremulous womanhood a more
enchanting breathing image of fidelity than Francesca looked as Mr
Beresford read

 Oh I will cast off my gay costly gown
 And follow thee on from town unto town
 And I will take the gold kaims from my hair
 And follow my true love for evermair

Whereupon Hynde Horn lets his beggar weeds fall and shines there the
foremost and noblest of all the kings companie as he says

 You need not cast off your gay costly gown
 To follow me on from town unto town
 You need not take the gold kaims from your hair
 For Hynde Horn has gold enough and to spare

 Then the bridegrooms were changed and the lady rewed
 To Hynde Horn thus come back like one from the dead

There is no doubt that this tableau gained the success of the evening
and the participants in it should have modestly and gratefully received
the choruses of congratulation that were ready to be offered during
the supper and dance that followed Instead of that what happened
Francesca drove home with Miss Dalziel before the quadrille dhonneur
and when Willie bade me good night at the gate in the loaning he said
I shall not be early tomorrow dear I am going to see Macdonald off

Off I exclaimed Where is he going

Only to Edinburgh and London to stay till the last of next week

But we may have left Pettybaw by that time

Of course that is probably what he has in mind But let me tell you
this Penelope Macdonald is fathoms deep in love with Francesca and if
she trifles with him she shall know what I think of her

And let me tell you this sir Francesca is fathoms deep in love with
Ronald Macdonald little as you suspect it and if he trifles with her
he shall know what I think of him



Chapter XXIV Old songs and modern instances



 He set her on a coalblack steed
 Himself lap on behind her
 An hes awa to the Hieland hills
 Whare her friens they canna find her

Rob Roy



The occupants of BideaWee Cottage awoke in anything but a Jubilee
humour next day Willie had intended to come at nine but of course
did not appear Francesca took her breakfast in bed and came listlessly
into the sittingroom at ten oclock looking like a ghost Jeans ankle
was much betterthe sprain proved to be not even a strainbut her
wrist was painful It was drizzling too and we had promised Miss
Ardmore and Miss Macrae to aid with the last Jubilee decorations the
distribution of medals at the church and the childrens games and tea
on the links in the afternoon

We have determined not to desert our beloved Pettybaw for the metropolis
on this great day but to celebrate it with the dear fowk o Fife who
had grown to be a part of our lives

BideaWee Cottage does not occupy an imposing position in the
landscape and the choice of art fabrics at the Pettybaw drapers is
small but the moment it should stop raining we were intending to carry
out a dazzling scheme of decoration that would proclaim our affectionate
respect for the little lady in black on her Diamond Jubilee But would
it stop rainingthat was the question The draper wasna certain that
so licht a shoor could richtly be called rain The village weans
were yearning for the hour to arrive when they might sit on the wet
golfcourse and have tea manifestly therefore it could not be a bad
day for Scotland but if it should grow worse what would become of our
mammoth subscription bonfire on Pettybaw Lawthe bonfire that Brenda
Macrae was to light as the lady of the manor

There were no deputations to request the honour of Miss Macraes
distinguished services on this occasion that is not the way the
selfrespecting villager comports himself in Fifeshire The chairman of
the local committee a respectable gardener called upon Miss Macrae
at Pettybaw House and said Im sent to tell ye yere to have the
pleasure an the honour of lichtin the bonfire the nicht Ay its a
grand chance yere havin miss yell remember it as long as ye live
Im thinkin

When I complimented this rugged soul on his decoration of the triumphal
arch under which the schoolchildren were to pass I said I think if
her Majesty could see it she would be pleased with our village today
James

Ay yere richt miss he replied complacently Shed see that
Inchcawdy canna compeer wi us weve patronised her weel in Pettybaw

Truly as Stevenson says he who goes fishing among the Scots peasantry
with condescension for a bait will have an empty basket by evening

At eleven oclock a boy arrived at BideaWee with an
interestinglooking package which I promptly opened That dear foolish
lover of mine whose foolishness is one of the most adorable things
about him makes me only two visits a day and is therefore constrained
to send me some reminder of himself in the intervening hours or
minutesa book a flower or a note Uncovering the pretty box I found
a long slendersomethingof sparkling silver

What is it I exclaimed holding it up It is too long and not
wide enough for a paperknife although it would be famous for cutting
magazines Is it a baton Where did Willie find it and what can it be
There is something engraved on one side something that looks like birds
on a twigyes three little birds and see the lovely cairngorm set
in the end Oh it has words cut in it To Jean From Hynde
HornGoodness me Ive opened Miss Dalziels package

Francesca made a sudden swooping motion and caught box cover and
contents in her arms

It is mine I know it is mine she cried You really ought not to
claim everything that is sent to the house Penelopeas if nobody
had any friends or presents but you and she rushed upstairs like a
whirlwind

I examined the outside wrapper lying on the floor and found to my
chagrin that it did bear Miss Monroes name somewhat blotted by the
rain but if the box were addressed to her why was the silver thing
inscribed to Miss Dalziel Well Francesca would explain the mystery
within the hour unless she had become a changed being

Fifteen minutes passed Salemina was making Jubilee sandwiches at
Pettybaw House Miss Dalziel was asleep in her room I was being
devoured slowly by curiosity when Francesca came down without a word
walked out of the front door went up to the main street and entered
the village postoffice without so much as a backward glance She was
a changed being then I might as well be living in a Gaboriau novel I
thought and went up into my little painting and writing room to address
a programme of the Pettybaw celebration to Lady Baird watch for the
glimpse of Willie coming down the loaning and see if I could discover
where Francesca went from the postoffice

Sitting down by my desk I could find neither my wax nor my silver
candlestick my scissors nor my ball of twine Plainly Francesca had
been on one of her borrowing tours and she had left an additional trace
of herselfif one were neededin a book of old Scottish ballads open
at Hynde Horn I glanced at it idly while I was waiting for her to
return I was not familiar with the opening verses and these were the
first lines that met my eye

 Oh he gave to his love a silver wand
 Her sceptre of rule over fair Scotland
 With three singing laverocks set thereon
 For to mind her of him when he was gone

 And his love gave to him a gay gold ring
 With three shining diamonds set therein
 Oh his love gave to him this gay gold ring
 Of virtue and value above all thing

A light dawned upon me The silver mystery then was intended for a
wandand a very pretty way of making love to an American girl too to
call it a sceptre of rule over fair Scotland and the three birds were
three singing laverocks to mind her of him when he was gone

But the real Hynde Horn in the dear old ballad had a truelove who was
not captious and capricious and cold like Francesca His love gave him a
gay gold ring

 Of virtue and value above all thing

Yet stay behind the ballad book flung heedlessly on my desk waswhat
should it be but the little morocco case empty now in which our
Francesca keeps her dead mothers engagement ringthe mother who died
when she was a wee child Truly a very pretty modern ballad to be sung
in these unromantic degenerate days

Francesca came in at the door behind me saw her secret reflected in my
telltale face saw the sympathetic moisture in my eyes and flinging
herself into my willing arms burst into tears

O Pen dear dear Pen I am so miserable and so happy so afraid that
he wont come back so frightened for fear that he will I sent him away
because there were so many lions in the path and I didnt know how
to slay them I thought of my ffather I thought of my cccountry I
didnt want to live with him in Scotland I knew that I couldnt live
without him in America and there I was I didnt think I was ssuited
to a minister and I am not but oh this pparticular minister is so
ssuited to me and she threw herself on the sofa and buried her head
in the cushions

She was so absurd even in her grief that I had hard work to keep from
smiling

Let us talk about the lions I said soothingly But when did the
trouble begin When did he speak to you

After the tableau last night but of course there had been
otherothertimesand things

Of course Well

He had told me a week before that he should go away for a while that
it made him too wretched to stay here just now and I suppose that was
when he got the silver wand ready for me It was meant for the Jean of
the poem you know Of course he would not put my own name on a gift
like that

You dont think he had it made for Jean Dalziel in the first placeI
asked this thinking she needed some sort of tonic in her relaxed
condition

You know him better than that Penelope I am ashamed of you We had
read Hynde Horn together ages before Jean Dalziel came but I imagine
when we came to acting the lines he thought it would be better to have
some other kings daughter that is that it would be less personal
And I never never would have been in the tableau if I had dared refuse
Lady Ardmore or could have explained but I had no time to think And
then naturally he thought by me being there as the kings daughter
thatthatthe lions were slain you know instead of which they were
roaring so that I could hardly hear the orchestra

Francesca look me in the eye Doyoulove him

Love him I adore him she exclaimed in good clear decisive English
as she rose impetuously and paced up and down in front of the sofa But
in the first place there is the difference in nationality

I have no patience with you One would think he was a Turk an
Esquimau or a cannibal He is white he speaks English and he believes
in the Christian religion The idea of calling such a man a foreigner

Oh it didnt prevent me from loving him she confessed but I
thought at first it would be unpatriotic to marry him

Did you think Columbia could not spare you even as a rare specimen to
be used for exhibition purposes I asked wickedly

You know I am not so conceited as that No she continued ingenuously
I feared that if I accepted him it would look over here as if the
homesupply of husbands were of inferior quality and then we had such
disagreeable discussions at the beginning I simply could not bear
to leave my nice new free country and ally myself with his aeons of
tiresome history But it came to me in the night a week ago that
after all I should hate a man who didnt love his Fatherland and in
the illumination of that new idea Ronalds character assumed a different
outline in my mind How could he love America when he had never seen it
How could I convince him that American women are the most charming in
the world in any better way than by letting him live under the same roof
with a good example How could I expect him to let me love my country
best unless I permitted him to love his best

You neednt offer so many apologies for your infatuation my dear I
answered dryly

I am not apologising for it she exclaimed impulsively Oh if you
could only keep it to yourself I should like to tell you how I trust
and admire and reverence Ronald Macdonald but of course you will repeat
everything to Willie Beresford within the hour You think he has gone on
and on loving me against his better judgment You believe he has fought
against it because of my unfitness but that I poor weak trivial
thing am not capable of deep feeling and that I shall never appreciate
the sacrifices he makes in choosing me Very well then I tell you
plainly that if I had to live in a damp manse the rest of my life drink
tea and eat scones for breakfast andand buy my hats of the Inchcaldy
milliner I should still glory in the possibility of being Ronald
Macdonalds wifea possibility hourly growing more uncertain I am
sorry to say

And the extreme aversion with which you began I askedwhat
has become of that and when did it begin to turn in the opposite
direction

Aversion she cried with convincing and unblushing candour That
aversion was a cover clapped on to keep my selfrespect warm I abused
him a good deal it is true because it was so delightful to hear you
and Salemina take his part Sometimes I trembled for fear you would
agree with me but you never did The more I criticised him the louder
you sang his praisesit was lovely The fact iswe might as well throw
light upon the whole matter and then never allude to it again and if
you tell Willie Beresford you shall never visit my manse nor see me
preside at my mothers meetings nor hear me address the infant class in
the Sundayschoolthe fact is I liked him from the beginning at Lady
Bairds dinner I liked the bow he made when he offered me his arm I
wish it had been his hand I liked the top of his head when it was
bowed I liked his arm when I took it I liked the height of his
shoulder when I stood beside it I liked the way he put me in my chair
that showed chivalry and unfolded his napkin that was neat and
businesslike and pushed aside all his wineglasses but one that was
temperate I liked the side view of his nose the shape of his collar
the cleanness of his shave the manliness of his toneoh I liked him
altogether you must know how it is Penelopethe goodness and strength
and simplicity that radiated from him And when he said within the
first halfhour that international alliances presented even more
difficulties to the imagination than others I felt to my confusion a
distinct sense of disappointment Even while I was quarrelling with him
I said to myself Poor darling you cannot have him even if you should
want him so dont look at him muchBut I did look at him and what
is worse he looked at me and what is worse yet he curled himself so
tightly round my heart that if he takes himself away I shall be cold
the rest of my life

Then you are really sure of your love this time and you have never
advised him to wed somebody more worthy than yourself I asked

Not I she replied I wouldnt put such an idea into his head for
worlds He might adopt it



Chapter XXV A treaty between nations



 Pale and wan was she when Glenlogie gaed ben
 But red rosy grew she wheneer he sat doun

Glenlogie



Just here the front door banged and a manly step sounded on the stair
Francesca sat up straight in a big chair and dried her eyes hastily
with her poor little wet ball of a handkerchief for she knows that
Willie is a privileged visitor in my studio The door opened it was
ajar and Ronald Macdonald strode into the room I hope I may never have
the same sense of nothingness again To be young pleasing gifted
and to be regarded no more than a fly upon the wall is death to ones
selfrespect

He dropped on one knee beside Francesca and took her two hands in his
without removing his gaze from her speaking face She burned but did
not flinch under the ordeal The colour leaped into her cheeks Love
swam in her tears but was not drowned there it was too strong

Did you mean it he asked

She looked at him trembling as she said I meant every word and far
far more I meant all that a girl can say to a man when she loves him
and wants to be everything she is capable of being to him to his work
to his people and to hiscountry

Even this brief colloquy had been embarrassing but I knew that worse
was still to come and could not be delayed much longer so I left the
room hastily and with no attempt at apologynot that they minded my
presence in the least or observed my exit though I was obliged to leap
over Mr Macdonalds feet in passing

I found Mr Beresford sitting on the stairs in the lower hall

Willie you angel you idol where did you find him I exclaimed

When I went into the postoffice an hour ago he replied I met
Francesca She asked me for Macdonalds Edinburgh address saying she
had something that belonged to him and wished to send it after him
I offered to address the package and see that it reached him as
expeditiously as possible That is what I wish she said with
elaborate formality This is something I have just discovered
something he needs very much something he does not know he has
left behind I did not think it best to tell her at the moment that
Macdonald had not yet deserted Inchcaldy

Willie you have the quickest intelligence and the most exquisite
insight of any man I ever met

But the fact was that I had been to see him off and found him detained
by the sudden illness of one of his elders I rode over again to take
him the little parcel Of course I dont know what it contained by its
size and shape I should judge it might be a thimble or a collarbutton
or a sixpence but at all events he must have needed the thing for
he certainly did not let the grass grow under his feet after he received
it Let us go into the sittingroom until they come downas they will
have to poor wretches sooner or later I know that I am always being
brought down against my will Salemina wants your advice about the
number of her Majestys portraits to be hung on the front of the
cottage and the number of candles to be placed in each window

It was a halfhour later when Mr Macdonald came into the room and
walking directly up to Salemina kissed her hand respectfully

Miss Salemina he said with evident emotion I want to borrow one of
your national jewels for my Queens crown

And what will our President say to lose a jewel from his crown

Good republican rulers do not wear coronets as a matter of principle
he argued but in truth I fear I am not thinking of her MajestyGod
bless her This gem is not entirely for state occasions

 I would wear it in my bosom
 Lest my jewel I should tine

It is the crowning of my own life rather than that of the British
Empire that engages my present thought Will you intercede for me with
Francescas father

And this is the end of all your international bickering Salemina
asked teasingly

Yes he answered we have buried the hatchet signed articles of
agreement made treaties of international comity Francesca stays over
here as a kind of missionary to Scotland so she says or as a feminine
diplomat she wishes to be on hand to enforce the Monroe Doctrine
properly in case her governments accredited ambassadors relax in the
performance of their duty

Salemina called a laughing voice outside the door I am
wonerful lifted up You will be a prood woman the day for I am now
Estaiblished and Francesca clad in Miss Grieves Sunday bonnet
shawl and black cotton gloves entered and curtsied demurely to the
floor She held as corroborative detail a life of John Knox in her
hand and anything more incongruous than her sparkling eyes and mutinous
mouth under the melancholy headgear can hardly be imagined

I am now Estaiblished she repeated Div ye ken the new asseestant
frae Inchcawdy pairish Im the mon a second deep curtsy here
I trust leddies that yell mak the maist o your releegious
preevileges an that yell be constant at the kurrukHave you given
papas consent Salemina And isnt it dreadful that he is Scotch

Isnt it dreadful that she is not asked Mr Macdonald Yet to my
mind no woman in Scotland is half as lovable as she

And no man in America begins to compare with him Francesca
confessed sadly Isnt it pitiful that out of the millions of our own
countrypeople we couldnt have found somebody that would do What do
you think now Lord Ronald Macdonald of these dangerous international
alliances

You never understood that speech of mine he replied with prompt
mendacity When I said that international marriages presented more
difficulties to the imagination than others I was thinking of your
marriage and mine and that I knew from the first moment I saw you
would be extremely difficult to arrange



Chapter XXVI Scotlands burning Look out



 And soon a score of fires I ween
 From height and hill and cliff were seen
       
 Each after each they glanced to sight
 As stars arise upon the night
 They gleamed on many a dusky tarn
 Haunted by the lonely earn
 On many a cairns grey pyramid
 Where urns of mighty chiefs lie hid

The Lay of the Last Minstrel



The rain continued at intervals throughout the day but as the afternoon
wore on the skies looked a trifle more hopeful It would be saft no
doubt climbing the Law but the bonfire must be lighted Would Pettybaw
be behind London Would Pettybaw desert the Queen in her hour of need
Not though the rain were bursting the wellheads on Cawda not though
the swollen mountain burns drowned us to the knee So off we started as
the short midsummer night descended

We were to climb the Law wait for the signal from Cawdas lonely
height and then fire Pettybaws torch of loyalty to the little lady
in black not a blaze flaming out war and rumours of war as was the
beaconfire on the old grey battlements of Edinburgh Castle in the days
of yore but a message of peace and goodwill Pausing at a hut on
the side of the great green mountain we looked north toward Helva
whitecrested with a wreath of vapour You need not look on your map of
Scotland for Cawda and Helva for you will not find them any more
than you will find Pettybaw and Inchcaldy One by one the tops of the
distant hills began to clear and with the glass we could discern the
bonfire cairns upbuilt here and there for Scotlands evening sacrifice
of love and fealty Cawda was still veiled and Cawda was to give the
signal for all the smaller fires Pettybaws I suppose was counted
as a flash in the pan but not one of the hundred patriots climbing the
mountainside would have acknowledged it to us the good name of the
kingdom of Fife and the glory of the British Empire depended on Pettybaw
fire Some of us had misgivings toomisgivings founded upon Miss
Grieves dismal prophecies She had agreed to put nine lighted candles
in each of our cottage windows at ten oclock but had declined to
go out of her kitchen to see a procession hear a band or look at
a bonfire She had had a fair sickenin day an amount of work too
wearifu for one person by her lane She hoped that the bonfire wasna
built o Mrs Sinklers coals nor Mr Macbroses kindlings nor soaked
with Mr Camerons paraffin and she finished with the customary but
irrelative and exasperating allusion to the exceedingly nice family
with whom she had live in Glasgy

And still we toiled upward keeping our doubts to ourselves Jean was
limping bravely supported by Robin Anstruthers arm Mr Macdonald
was ardently helping Francesca who can climb like a chamois but would
doubtless rather be assisted Her gypsy face shone radiant out of her
black cloth hood and Ronalds was no less luminous I have never seen
two beings more lovedaft They comport themselves as if they had
read the manuscript of the tender passion and were moving in exalted
superiority through a less favoured worlda world waiting impatiently
for the first number of the story to come out

Still we climbed and as we approached the Grey Lady a curious rock
very near the summit somebody proposed three cheers for the Queen

How the children hurrahedfor the infant heart is easily
inflamedand how their shrill Jubilee slogan pierced the mystery of
the night and went rolling on from glen to glen to the Firth of Forth
itself Then there was a shout from the rocketmen far out on the open
moorCawdas clear Cawdas clear Back against a silver sky stood
the signal pile and signal rockets flashed upward to be answered from
all the surrounding hills

Now to light our own fire One of the village committee solemnly took
off his hat and poured on oil The great moment had come Brenda Macrae
approached the sacred pile and tremulous from the effect of much
contradictory advice applied the torch Silence thou Grieve and
others false prophets of disaster Who now could say that Pettybaw
bonfire had been badly built or that its fifteen tons of coal and
twenty cords of wood had been unphilosophically heaped together

The flames rushed toward the sky with ruddy blaze shining with weird
effect against the black firtrees and the blacker night Three cheers
more God save the Queen May she reign over us happy and glorious And
we cheered lustily too you may be sure It was more for the woman
than the monarch it was for the blameless life not for the splendid
monarchy but there was everything hearty and nothing alien in our
tone when we sang God save the Queen with the rest of the Pettybaw
villagers

The land darkened the wind blew chill Willie Mr Macdonald and Mr
Anstruther brought rugs and found a sheltered nook for us where we
might still watch the scene There we sat looking at the plains below
with all the village streets sparkling with light with rockets shooting
into the air and falling to earth in golden rain with red lights
flickering on the grey lakes and with one beaconfire after another
gleaming from the hilltops till we could count more than fifty
answering one another from the wooded crests along the shore some
of them piercing the rifts of lowlying clouds till they seemed to be
burning in midheaven

Then one by one the distant fires faded and as some of us still sat
there silently far far away in the grey east there was a faint flush
of carmine where the new dawn was kindling in secret Underneath
that violet bank of cloud the sun was forging his beams of light The
polestar paled The breath of the new morrow stole up out of the rosy
grey The wings of the morning stirred and trembled and in the darkness
and chill and mysterious awakening eyes looked into other eyes hand
sought hand and cheeks touched each other in mute caress



Chapter XXVII Three magpies and a marriage



 Sun gallop down the westlin skies
 Gang soon to bed an quickly rise
 O lash your steeds post time away
 And haste about our bridal day

The Gentle Shepherd



Every noon during this last week as we have wended our way up the
loaning to the Pettybaw inn for our luncheon we have passed three
magpies sitting together on the topmost rail of the fence I am not
prepared to state that they were always the same magpies I only know
there were always three of them We have just discovered what they were
about and great is the excitement in our little circle I am to be
married tomorrow and married in Pettybaw and Miss Grieve says that
in Scotland the number of magpies one sees is of infinite significance
that one means sorrow two mirth three a marriage four a birth and
we now recall as corroborative detail that we saw one magpie our first
on the afternoon of her arrival

Mr Beresford has been cabled for and must return to America at once on
important business He persuaded me that the Atlantic is an ower large
body of water to roll between two lovers and I agreed with all my
heart

A wedding was arranged mostly by telegraph in six hours The Reverend
Ronald and the Friar are to perform the ceremony a dear old painter
friend of mine a London RA will come to give me away Francesca
will be my maid of honour Elizabeth Ardmore and Jean Dalziel my
bridemaidens Robin Anstruther the best man while Jamie and Ralph will
be kilted pagesinwaiting and Lady Ardmore will give the breakfast at
the Castle

Never was there such generosity such hospitality such wealth of
friendship True I have no wedding finery but as I am perforce a
Scottish bride I can be married in the white gown with the silver
thistles in which I went to Holyrood

Mr Anstruther took a night train to and from London to choose the
bouquets and bridal souvenirs Lady Baird has sent the veil and a
wonderful diamond thistle to pin it ona jewel fit for a princess
With the dear Dominies note promising to be an usher came an antique
silver casket filled with white heather And as for the bridecake
it is one of Saleminas gifts chosen as much in a spirit of fun
as affection It is surely appropriate for this American wedding
transplanted to Scottish soil and what should it be but a model in
fairy icing of Sir Walters beautiful monument in Princes Street Of
course Francesca is full of nonsensical quips about it and says that
the Edinburgh jail would have been just as fine architecturally it is
in truth a building beautiful enough to tempt an aesthete to crime
and a much more fitting symbol for a weddingcake unless indeed she
adds Salemina intends her gift to be a monument to my folly

Pettybaw kirk is trimmed with yellow broom from these dear Scottish
banks and braes and waving their green fans and plumes up and down
the aisle where I shall walk a bride are tall ferns and bracken from
Crummylowe Glen where we played ballads

As I look back upon it the life here has been all a ballad from first
to last Like the elfin Tam Lin

 The queen o fairies she caught me
 In this green hill to dwell

and these hasty nuptials are a fittingly romantic ending to the
summers poetry I am in a mood were it necessary to be taen by
the milkwhite hand lifted to a pillion on a coalblack charger
and spirited oer the border an awa by my dear Jock o Hazeldean
Unhappily all is quite regular and aboveboard no lord o Langley
dale contests the prize with the bridegroom but the marriage is
at least unique and unconventional no one can rob me of that sweet
consolation

So gallop down the westlin skies dear Sun but prythee gallop back
tomorrow Gang soon to bed an you will but rise again betimes Give
me Queens weather dear Sun and shine a benison upon my weddingmorn


Exit Penelope into the balladland of maiden dreams
