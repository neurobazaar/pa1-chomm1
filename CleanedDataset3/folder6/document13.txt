 THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK
 an Agony in Eight Fits
 by
 Lewis Carroll



PREFACE

Ifand the thing is wildly possiblethe charge of writing nonsense
were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive
poem it would be based I feel convinced on the line in p4

 Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes

In view of this painful possibility I will not as I might appeal
indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of
such a deed I will not as I might point to the strong moral purpose
of this poem itself to the arithmetical principles so cautiously
inculcated in it or to its noble teachings in Natural HistoryI will
take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened

The Bellman who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances used
to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished
and it more than once happened when the time came for replacing it
that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged
to They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman
about ithe would only refer to his Naval Code and read out in
pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of them had ever been
able to understandso it generally ended in its being fastened on
anyhow across the rudder The helmsman used to stand by with tears in
his eyes he knew it was all wrong but alas Rule 42 of the Code No
one shall speak to the Man at the Helm had been completed by the
Bellman himself with the words and the Man at the Helm shall speak to
no one So remonstrance was impossible and no steering could be done
till the next varnishing day During these bewildering intervals the
ship usually sailed backwards

As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock
let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been
asked me how to pronounce slithy toves The i in slithy is long
as in writhe and toves is pronounced so as to rhyme with groves
Again the first o in borogoves is pronounced like the o in
borrow I have heard people try to give it the sound of the o in
worry Such is Human Perversity

This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in
that poem HumptyDumptys theory of two meanings packed into one word
like a portmanteau seems to me the right explanation for all

For instance take the two words fuming and furious Make up your
mind that you will say both words but leave it unsettled which you will
first Now open your mouth and speak If your thoughts incline
ever so little towards fuming you will say fumingfurious if they
turn by even a hairs breadth towards furious you will say
furiousfuming but if you have the rarest of gifts a perfectly
balanced mind you will say frumious

Supposing that when Pistol uttered the wellknown words

 Under which king Bezonian Speak or die

Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard
but had not been able to settle which so that he could not possibly say
either name before the other can it be doubted that rather than die
he would have gasped out Rilchiam



 Fit the First

 THE LANDING


 Just the place for a Snark the Bellman cried
 As he landed his crew with care
 Supporting each man on the top of the tide
 By a finger entwined in his hair

 Just the place for a Snark I have said it twice
 That alone should encourage the crew
 Just the place for a Snark I have said it thrice
 What I tell you three times is true

 The crew was complete it included a Boots
 A maker of Bonnets and Hoods
 A Barrister brought to arrange their disputes
 And a Broker to value their goods

 A Billiardmarker whose skill was immense
 Might perhaps have won more than his share
 But a Banker engaged at enormous expense
 Had the whole of their cash in his care

 There was also a Beaver that paced on the deck
 Or would sit making lace in the bow
 And had often the Bellman said saved them from wreck
 Though none of the sailors knew how

 There was one who was famed for the number of things
 He forgot when he entered the ship
 His umbrella his watch all his jewels and rings
 And the clothes he had bought for the trip

 He had fortytwo boxes all carefully packed
 With his name painted clearly on each
 But since he omitted to mention the fact
 They were all left behind on the beach

 The loss of his clothes hardly mattered because
 He had seven coats on when he came
 With three pairs of bootsbut the worst of it was
 He had wholly forgotten his name

 He would answer to Hi or to any loud cry
 Such as Fry me or Fritter my wig
 To Whatyoumaycallum or Whatwashisname
 But especially Thingumajig

 While for those who preferred a more forcible word
 He had different names from these
 His intimate friends called him Candleends
 And his enemies Toastedcheese

 His form is ungainlyhis intellect small
 So the Bellman would often remark
 But his courage is perfect And that after all
 Is the thing that one needs with a Snark

 He would joke with hyenas returning their stare
 With an impudent wag of the head
 And he once went a walk pawinpaw with a bear
 Just to keep up its spirits he said

 He came as a Baker but owned when too late
 And it drove the poor Bellman halfmad
 He could only bake Bridecakefor which I may state
 No materials were to be had

 The last of the crew needs especial remark
 Though he looked an incredible dunce
 He had just one ideabut that one being Snark
 The good Bellman engaged him at once

 He came as a Butcher but gravely declared
 When the ship had been sailing a week
 He could only kill Beavers The Bellman looked scared
 And was almost too frightened to speak

 But at length he explained in a tremulous tone
 There was only one Beaver on board
 And that was a tame one he had of his own
 Whose death would be deeply deplored

 The Beaver who happened to hear the remark
 Protested with tears in its eyes
 That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark
 Could atone for that dismal surprise

 It strongly advised that the Butcher should be
 Conveyed in a separate ship
 But the Bellman declared that would never agree
 With the plans he had made for the trip

 Navigation was always a difficult art
 Though with only one ship and one bell
 And he feared he must really decline for his part
 Undertaking another as well

 The Beavers best course was no doubt to procure
 A secondhand daggerproof coat
 So the Baker advised itand next to insure
 Its life in some Office of note

 This the Banker suggested and offered for hire
 On moderate terms or for sale
 Two excellent Policies one Against Fire
 And one Against Damage From Hail

 Yet still ever after that sorrowful day
 Whenever the Butcher was by
 The Beaver kept looking the opposite way
 And appeared unaccountably shy



 Fit the Second

 THE BELLMANS SPEECH


 The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies
 Such a carriage such ease and such grace
 Such solemnity too One could see he was wise
 The moment one looked in his face

 He had bought a large map representing the sea
 Without the least vestige of land
 And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
 A map they could all understand

 Whats the good of Mercators North Poles and Equators
 Tropics Zones and Meridian Lines
 So the Bellman would cry and the crew would reply
 They are merely conventional signs

 Other maps are such shapes with their islands and capes
 But weve got our brave Captain to thank
 So the crew would protest that hes bought us the best
 A perfect and absolute blank

 This was charming no doubt but they shortly found out
 That the Captain they trusted so well
 Had only one notion for crossing the ocean
 And that was to tingle his bell

 He was thoughtful and gravebut the orders he gave
 Were enough to bewilder a crew
 When he cried Steer to starboard but keep her head larboard
 What on earth was the helmsman to do

 Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes
 A thing as the Bellman remarked
 That frequently happens in tropical climes
 When a vessel is so to speak snarked

 But the principal failing occurred in the sailing
 And the Bellman perplexed and distressed
 Said he had hoped at least when the wind blew due East
 That the ship would not travel due West

 But the danger was pastthey had landed at last
 With their boxes portmanteaus and bags
 Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view
 Which consisted of chasms and crags

 The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low
 And repeated in musical tone
 Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe
 But the crew would do nothing but groan

 He served out some grog with a liberal hand
 And bade them sit down on the beach
 And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand
 As he stood and delivered his speech

 Friends Romans and countrymen lend me your ears
 They were all of them fond of quotations
 So they drank to his health and they gave him three cheers
 While he served out additional rations

 We have sailed many months we have sailed many weeks
 Four weeks to the month you may mark
 But never as yet tis your Captain who speaks
 Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark

 We have sailed many weeks we have sailed many days
 Seven days to the week I allow
 But a Snark on the which we might lovingly gaze
 We have never beheld till now

 Come listen my men while I tell you again
 The five unmistakable marks
 By which you may know wheresoever you go
 The warranted genuine Snarks

 Let us take them in order The first is the taste
 Which is meagre and hollow but crisp
 Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist
 With a flavour of Willothewisp

 Its habit of getting up late youll agree
 That it carries too far when I say
 That it frequently breakfasts at fiveoclock tea
 And dines on the following day

 The third is its slowness in taking a jest
 Should you happen to venture on one
 It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed
 And it always looks grave at a pun

 The fourth is its fondness for bathingmachines
 Which is constantly carries about
 And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes
 A sentiment open to doubt

 The fifth is ambition It next will be right
 To describe each particular batch
 Distinguishing those that have feathers and bite
 And those that have whiskers and scratch

 For although common Snarks do no manner of harm
 Yet I feel it my duty to say
 Some are Boojums The Bellman broke off in alarm
 For the Baker had fainted away



 Fit the Third

 THE BAKERS TALE


 They roused him with muffinsthey roused him with ice
 They roused him with mustard and cress
 They roused him with jam and judicious advice
 They set him conundrums to guess

 When at length he sat up and was able to speak
 His sad story he offered to tell
 And the Bellman cried Silence Not even a shriek
 And excitedly tingled his bell

 There was silence supreme Not a shriek not a scream
 Scarcely even a howl or a groan
 As the man they called Ho told his story of woe
 In an antediluvian tone

 My father and mother were honest though poor
 Skip all that cried the Bellman in haste
 If it once becomes dark theres no chance of a Snark
 We have hardly a minute to waste

 I skip forty years said the Baker in tears
 And proceed without further remark
 To the day when you took me aboard of your ship
 To help you in hunting the Snark

 A dear uncle of mine after whom I was named
 Remarked when I bade him farewell
 Oh skip your dear uncle the Bellman exclaimed
 As he angrily tingled his bell

 He remarked to me then said that mildest of men
 If your Snark be a Snark that is right
 Fetch it home by all meansyou may serve it with greens
 And its handy for striking a light

 You may seek it with thimblesand seek it with care
 You may hunt it with forks and hope
 You may threaten its life with a railwayshare
 You may charm it with smiles and soap

 Thats exactly the method the Bellman bold
 In a hasty parenthesis cried
 Thats exactly the way I have always been told
 That the capture of Snarks should be tried

 But oh beamish nephew beware of the day
 If your Snark be a Boojum For then
 You will softly and suddenly vanish away
 And never be met with again

 It is this it is this that oppresses my soul
 When I think of my uncles last words
 And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
 Brimming over with quivering curds

 It is this it is this We have had that before
 The Bellman indignantly said
 And the Baker replied Let me say it once more
 It is this it is this that I dread

 I engage with the Snarkevery night after dark
 In a dreamy delirious fight
 I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes
 And I use it for striking a light

 But if ever I meet with a Boojum that day
 In a moment of this I am sure
 I shall softly and suddenly vanish away
 And the notion I cannot endure



 Fit the fourth

 THE HUNTING


 The Bellman looked huffish and wrinkled his brow
 If only youd spoken before
 Its excessively awkward to mention it now
 With the Snark so to speak at the door

 We should all of us grieve as you well may believe
 If you never were met with again
 But surely my man when the voyage began
 You might have suggested it then

 Its excessively awkward to mention it now
 As I think Ive already remarked
 And the man they called Hi replied with a sigh
 I informed you the day we embarked

 You may charge me with murderor want of sense
 We are all of us weak at times
 But the slightest approach to a false pretence
 Was never among my crimes

 I said it in HebrewI said it in Dutch
 I said it in German and Greek
 But I wholly forgot and it vexes me much
 That English is what you speak

 Tis a pitiful tale said the Bellman whose face
 Had grown longer at every word
 But now that youve stated the whole of your case
 More debate would be simply absurd

 The rest of my speech he explained to his men
 You shall hear when Ive leisure to speak it
 But the Snark is at hand let me tell you again
 Tis your glorious duty to seek it

 To seek it with thimbles to seek it with care
 To pursue it with forks and hope
 To threaten its life with a railwayshare
 To charm it with smiles and soap

 For the Snarks a peculiar creature that wont
 Be caught in a commonplace way
 Do all that you know and try all that you dont
 Not a chance must be wasted today

 For England expectsI forbear to proceed
 Tis a maxim tremendous but trite
 And youd best be unpacking the things that you need
 To rig yourselves out for the fight

 Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque which he crossed
 And changed his loose silver for notes
 The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair
 And shook the dust out of his coats

 The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade
 Each working the grindstone in turn
 But the Beaver went on making lace and displayed
 No interest in the concern

 Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride
 And vainly proceeded to cite
 A number of cases in which making laces
 Had been proved an infringement of right

 The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned
 A novel arrangement of bows
 While the Billiardmarker with quivering hand
 Was chalking the tip of his nose

 But the Butcher turned nervous and dressed himself fine
 With yellow kid gloves and a ruff
 Said he felt it exactly like going to dine
 Which the Bellman declared was all stuff

 Introduce me now theres a good fellow he said
 If we happen to meet it together
 And the Bellman sagaciously nodding his head
 Said That must depend on the weather

 The Beaver went simply galumphing about
 At seeing the Butcher so shy
 And even the Baker though stupid and stout
 Made an effort to wink with one eye

 Be a man said the Bellman in wrath as he heard
 The Butcher beginning to sob
 Should we meet with a Jubjub that desperate bird
 We shall need all our strength for the job



 Fit the Fifth

 THE BEAVERS LESSON


 They sought it with thimbles they sought it with care
 They pursued it with forks and hope
 They threatened its life with a railwayshare
 They charmed it with smiles and soap

 Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan
 For making a separate sally
 And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man
 A dismal and desolate valley

 But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred
 It had chosen the very same place
 Yet neither betrayed by a sign or a word
 The disgust that appeared in his face

 Each thought he was thinking of nothing but Snark
 And the glorious work of the day
 And each tried to pretend that he did not remark
 That the other was going that way

 But the valley grew narrow and narrower still
 And the evening got darker and colder
 Till merely from nervousness not from goodwill
 They marched along shoulder to shoulder

 Then a scream shrill and high rent the shuddering sky
 And they knew that some danger was near
 The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail
 And even the Butcher felt queer

 He thought of his childhood left far far behind
 That blissful and innocent state
 The sound so exactly recalled to his mind
 A pencil that squeaks on a slate

 Tis the voice of the Jubjub he suddenly cried
 This man that they used to call Dunce
 As the Bellman would tell you he added with pride
 I have uttered that sentiment once

 Tis the note of the Jubjub Keep count I entreat
 You will find I have told it you twice
 Tis the song of the Jubjub The proof is complete
 If only Ive stated it thrice

 The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care
 Attending to every word
 But it fairly lost heart and outgrabe in despair
 When the third repetition occurred

 It felt that in spite of all possible pains
 It had somehow contrived to lose count
 And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains
 By reckoning up the amount

 Two added to oneif that could but be done
 It said with ones fingers and thumbs
 Recollecting with tears how in earlier years
 It had taken no pains with its sums

 The thing can be done said the Butcher I think
 The thing must be done I am sure
 The thing shall be done Bring me paper and ink
 The best there is time to procure

 The Beaver brought paper portfolio pens
 And ink in unfailing supplies
 While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens
 And watched them with wondering eyes

 So engrossed was the Butcher he heeded them not
 As he wrote with a pen in each hand
 And explained all the while in a popular style
 Which the Beaver could well understand

 Taking Three as the subject to reason about
 A convenient number to state
 We add Seven and Ten and then multiply out
 By One Thousand diminished by Eight

 The result we proceed to divide as you see
 By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two
 Then subtract Seventeen and the answer must be
 Exactly and perfectly true

 The method employed I would gladly explain
 While I have it so clear in my head
 If I had but the time and you had but the brain
 But much yet remains to be said

 In one moment Ive seen what has hitherto been
 Enveloped in absolute mystery
 And without extra charge I will give you at large
 A Lesson in Natural History

 In his genial way he proceeded to say
 Forgetting all laws of propriety
 And that giving instruction without introduction
 Would have caused quite a thrill in Society

 As to temper the Jubjubs a desperate bird
 Since it lives in perpetual passion
 Its taste in costume is entirely absurd
 It is ages ahead of the fashion

 But it knows any friend it has met once before
 It never will look at a bribe
 And in charitymeetings it stands at the door
 And collectsthough it does not subscribe

 Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far
 Than mutton or oysters or eggs
 Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar
 And some in mahogany kegs

 You boil it in sawdust you salt it in glue
 You condense it with locusts and tape
 Still keeping one principal object in view
 To preserve its symmetrical shape

 The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day
 But he felt that the lesson must end
 And he wept with delight in attempting to say
 He considered the Beaver his friend

 While the Beaver confessed with affectionate looks
 More eloquent even than tears
 It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books
 Would have taught it in seventy years

 They returned handinhand and the Bellman unmanned
 For a moment with noble emotion
 Said This amply repays all the wearisome days
 We have spent on the billowy ocean

 Such friends as the Beaver and Butcher became
 Have seldom if ever been known
 In winter or summer twas always the same
 You could never meet either alone

 And when quarrels aroseas one frequently finds
 Quarrels will spite of every endeavour
 The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds
 And cemented their friendship for ever



 Fit the Sixth

 THE BARRISTERS DREAM


 They sought it with thimbles they sought it with care
 They pursued it with forks and hope
 They threatened its life with a railwayshare
 They charmed it with smiles and soap

 But the Barrister weary of proving in vain
 That the Beavers lacemaking was wrong
 Fell asleep and in dreams saw the creature quite plain
 That his fancy had dwelt on so long

 He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court
 Where the Snark with a glass in its eye
 Dressed in gown bands and wig was defending a pig
 On the charge of deserting its sty

 The Witnesses proved without error or flaw
 That the sty was deserted when found
 And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law
 In a soft undercurrent of sound

 The indictment had never been clearly expressed
 And it seemed that the Snark had begun
 And had spoken three hours before any one guessed
 What the pig was supposed to have done

 The Jury had each formed a different view
 Long before the indictment was read
 And they all spoke at once so that none of them knew
 One word that the others had said

 You must know said the Judge but the Snark exclaimed Fudge
 That statute is obsolete quite
 Let me tell you my friends the whole question depends
 On an ancient manorial right

 In the matter of Treason the pig would appear
 To have aided but scarcely abetted
 While the charge of Insolvency fails it is clear
 If you grant the plea never indebted

 The fact of Desertion I will not dispute
 But its guilt as I trust is removed
 So far as related to the costs of this suit
 By the Alibi which has been proved

 My poor clients fate now depends on your votes
 Here the speaker sat down in his place
 And directed the Judge to refer to his notes
 And briefly to sum up the case

 But the Judge said he never had summed up before
 So the Snark undertook it instead
 And summed it so well that it came to far more
 Than the Witnesses ever had said

 When the verdict was called for the Jury declined
 As the word was so puzzling to spell
 But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldnt mind
 Undertaking that duty as well

 So the Snark found the verdict although as it owned
 It was spent with the toils of the day
 When it said the word GUILTY the Jury all groaned
 And some of them fainted away

 Then the Snark pronounced sentence the Judge being quite
 Too nervous to utter a word
 When it rose to its feet there was silence like night
 And the fall of a pin might be heard

 Transportation for life was the sentence it gave
 And _then_ to be fined forty pound
 The Jury all cheered though the Judge said he feared
 That the phrase was not legally sound

 But their wild exultation was suddenly checked
 When the jailer informed them with tears
 Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect
 As the pig had been dead for some years

 The Judge left the Court looking deeply disgusted
 But the Snark though a little aghast
 As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted
 Went bellowing on to the last

 Thus the Barrister dreamed while the bellowing seemed
 To grow every moment more clear
 Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell
 Which the Bellman rang close at his ear



 Fit the Seventh

 THE BANKERS FATE


 They sought it with thimbles they sought it with care
 They pursued it with forks and hope
 They threatened its life with a railwayshare
 They charmed it with smiles and soap

 And the Banker inspired with a courage so new
 It was matter for general remark
 Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view
 In his zeal to discover the Snark

 But while he was seeking with thimbles and care
 A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
 And grabbed at the Banker who shrieked in despair
 For he knew it was useless to fly

 He offered large discounthe offered a cheque
 Drawn to bearer for sevenpoundsten
 But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck
 And grabbed at the Banker again

 Without rest or pausewhile those frumious jaws
 Went savagely snapping around
 He skipped and he hopped and he floundered and flopped
 Till fainting he fell to the ground

 The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
 Led on by that fearstricken yell
 And the Bellman remarked It is just as I feared
 And solemnly tolled on his bell

 He was black in the face and they scarcely could trace
 The least likeness to what he had been
 While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white
 A wonderful thing to be seen

 To the horror of all who were present that day
 He uprose in full evening dress
 And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say
 What his tongue could no longer express

 Down he sank in a chairran his hands through his hair
 And chanted in mimsiest tones
 Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity
 While he rattled a couple of bones

 Leave him here to his fateit is getting so late
 The Bellman exclaimed in a fright
 We have lost half the day Any further delay
 And we shant catch a Snark before night



 Fit the Eighth

 THE VANISHING


 They sought it with thimbles they sought it with care
 They pursued it with forks and hope
 They threatened its life with a railwayshare
 They charmed it with smiles and soap

 They shuddered to think that the chase might fail
 And the Beaver excited at last
 Went bounding along on the tip of its tail
 For the daylight was nearly past

 There is Thingumbob shouting the Bellman said
 He is shouting like mad only hark
 He is waving his hands he is wagging his head
 He has certainly found a Snark

 They gazed in delight while the Butcher exclaimed
 He was always a desperate wag
 They beheld himtheir Bakertheir hero unnamed
 On the top of a neighboring crag

 Erect and sublime for one moment of time
 In the next that wild figure they saw
 As if stung by a spasm plunge into a chasm
 While they waited and listened in awe

 Its a Snark was the sound that first came to their ears
 And seemed almost too good to be true
 Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers
 Then the ominous words Its a Boo

 Then silence Some fancied they heard in the air
 A weary and wandering sigh
 Then sounded like jum but the others declare
 It was only a breeze that went by

 They hunted till darkness came on but they found
 Not a button or feather or mark
 By which they could tell that they stood on the ground
 Where the Baker had met with the Snark

 In the midst of the word he was trying to say
 In the midst of his laughter and glee
 He had softly and suddenly vanished away
 For the Snark _was_ a Boojum you see
