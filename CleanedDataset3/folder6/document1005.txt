Cantos 1  34



CANTO I


IN the midway of this our mortal life
I found me in a gloomy wood astray
Gone from the path direct and een to tell
It were no easy task how savage wild
That forest how robust and rough its growth
Which to remember only my dismay
Renews in bitterness not far from death
Yet to discourse of what there good befell
All else will I relate discoverd there
How first I enterd it I scarce can say
Such sleepy dullness in that instant weighd
My senses down when the true path I left
But when a mountains foot I reachd where closd
The valley that had piercd my heart with dread
I lookd aloft and saw his shoulders broad
Already vested with that planets beam
Who leads all wanderers safe through every way

Then was a little respite to the fear
That in my hearts recesses deep had lain
All of that night so pitifully passd
And as a man with difficult short breath
Forespent with toiling scapd from sea to shore
Turns to the perilous wide waste and stands
At gaze een so my spirit that yet faild
Struggling with terror turnd to view the straits
That none hath passd and livd My weary frame
After short pause recomforted again
I journeyd on over that lonely steep

The hinder foot still firmer Scarce the ascent
Began when lo a panther nimble light
And coverd with a speckled skin appeard
Nor when it saw me vanishd rather strove
To check my onward going that ofttimes
With purpose to retrace my steps I turnd

The hour was mornings prime and on his way
Aloft the sun ascended with those stars
That with him rose when Love divine first movd
Those its fair works so that with joyous hope
All things conspird to fill me the gay skin
Of that swift animal the matin dawn
And the sweet season Soon that joy was chasd
And by new dread succeeded when in view
A lion came gainst me as it appeard

With his head held aloft and hungermad
That een the air was fearstruck A shewolf
Was at his heels who in her leanness seemd
Full of all wants and many a land hath made
Disconsolate ere now She with such fear
Oerwhelmed me at the sight of her appalld
That of the height all hope I lost As one
Who with his gain elated sees the time
When all unwares is gone he inwardly
Mourns with heartgriping anguish such was I
Haunted by that fell beast never at peace
Who coming oer against me by degrees
Impelld me where the sun in silence rests

While to the lower space with backward step
I fell my ken discernd the form one of one
Whose voice seemd faint through long disuse of speech
When him in that great desert I espied
Have mercy on me cried I out aloud
Spirit or living man what eer thou be

He answerd Now not man man once I was
And born of Lombard parents Mantuana both
By country when the power of Julius yet
Was scarcely firm At Rome my life was past
Beneath the mild Augustus in the time
Of fabled deities and false A bard
Was I and made Anchises upright son
The subject of my song who came from Troy
When the flames preyd on Iliums haughty towers
But thou say wherefore to such perils past
Returnst thou wherefore not this pleasant mount
Ascendest cause and source of all delight
And art thou then that Virgil that wellspring
From which such copious floods of eloquence
Have issued I with front abashd replied
Glory and light of all the tuneful train
May it avail me that I long with zeal
Have sought thy volume and with love immense
Have connd it oer My master thou and guide
Thou he from whom alone I have derivd
That style which for its beauty into fame
Exalts me See the beast from whom I fled
O save me from her thou illustrious sage

For every vein and pulse throughout my frame
She hath made tremble He soon as he saw
That I was weeping answerd Thou must needs
Another way pursue if thou wouldst scape
From out that savage wilderness This beast
At whom thou criest her way will suffer none
To pass and no less hindrance makes than death
So bad and so accursed in her kind
That never sated is her ravenous will
Still after food more craving than before
To many an animal in wedlock vile
She fastens and shall yet to many more
Until that greyhound come who shall destroy
Her with sharp pain He will not life support
By earth nor its base metals but by love
Wisdom and virtue and his land shall be
The land twixt either Feltro In his might
Shall safety to Italias plains arise
For whose fair realm Camilla virgin pure
Nisus Euryalus and Turnus fell
He with incessant chase through every town
Shall worry until he to hell at length
Restore her thence by envy first let loose
I for thy profit pondring now devise
That thou mayst follow me and I thy guide
Will lead thee hence through an eternal space
Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks and see
Spirits of old tormented who invoke
A second death and those next view who dwell
Content in fire for that they hope to come
Wheneer the time may be among the blest
Into whose regions if thou then desire
T ascend a spirit worthier then I
Must lead thee in whose charge when I depart
Thou shalt be left for that Almighty King
Who reigns above a rebel to his law
Adjudges me and therefore hath decreed
That to his city none through me should come
He in all parts hath sway there rules there holds
His citadel and throne O happy those
Whom there he chooses I to him in few
Bard by that God whom thou didst not adore
I do beseech thee that this ill and worse
I may escape to lead me where thou saidst
That I Saint Peters gate may view and those
Who as thou tellst are in such dismal plight

Onward he movd I close his steps pursud




CANTO II

NOW was the day departing and the air
Imbrownd with shadows from their toils releasd
All animals on earth and I alone
Prepard myself the conflict to sustain
Both of sad pity and that perilous road
Which my unerring memory shall retrace

O Muses O high genius now vouchsafe
Your aid O mind that all I saw hast kept
Safe in a written record here thy worth
And eminent endowments come to proof

I thus began Bard thou who art my guide
Consider well if virtue be in me
Sufficient ere to this high enterprise
Thou trust me Thou hast told that Silvius sire
Yet clothd in corruptible flesh among
Th immortal tribes had entrance and was there
Sensible present Yet if heavens great Lord
Almighty foe to ill such favour shewd
In contemplation of the high effect
Both what and who from him should issue forth
It seems in reasons judgment well deservd
Sith he of Rome and of Romes empire wide
In heavens empyreal height was chosen sire
Both which if truth be spoken were ordaind
And stablishd for the holy place where sits
Who to great Peters sacred chair succeeds
He from this journey in thy song renownd
Learnd things that to his victory gave rise
And to the papal robe In aftertimes
The chosen vessel also traveld there
To bring us back assurance in that faith
Which is the entrance to salvations way
But I why should I there presume or who
Permits it not Aeneas I nor Paul
Myself I deem not worthy and none else
Will deem me I if on this voyage then
I venture fear it will in folly end
Thou who art wise better my meaning knowst
Than I can speak As one who unresolves
What he hath late resolvd and with new thoughts
Changes his purpose from his first intent
Removd een such was I on that dun coast
Wasting in thought my enterprise at first
So eagerly embracd If right thy words
I scan replied that shade magnanimous
Thy soul is by vile fear assaild which oft
So overcasts a man that he recoils
From noblest resolution like a beast
At some false semblance in the twilight gloom
That from this terror thou mayst free thyself
I will instruct thee why I came and what
I heard in that same instant when for thee
Grief touchd me first I was among the tribe
Who rest suspended when a dame so blest
And lovely I besought her to command
Calld me her eyes were brighter than the star
Of day and she with gentle voice and soft
Angelically tund her speech addressd
O courteous shade of Mantua thou whose fame
Yet lives and shall live long as nature lasts
A friend not of my fortune but myself
On the wide desert in his road has met
Hindrance so great that he through fear has turnd
Now much I dread lest he past help have strayd
And I be risn too late for his relief
From what in heaven of him I heard Speed now
And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue
And by all means for his deliverance meet
Assist him So to me will comfort spring
I who now bid thee on this errand forth
Am Beatrice from a place I come

Note Beatrice I use this word as it is
pronounced in the Italian as consisting of four
syllables of which the third is a long one

Revisited with joy Love brought me thence
Who prompts my speech When in my Masters sight
I stand thy praise to him I oft will tell

She then was silent and I thus began
O Lady by whose influence alone
Mankind excels whatever is containd
Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb
So thy command delights me that to obey
If it were done already would seem late
No need hast thou farther to speak thy will
Yet tell the reason why thou art not loth
To leave that ample space where to return
Thou burnest for this centre here beneath

She then Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire
I will instruct thee briefly why no dread
Hinders my entrance here Those things alone
Are to be feard whence evil may proceed
None else for none are terrible beside
I am so framd by God thanks to his grace
That any suffrance of your misery
Touches me not nor flame of that fierce fire
Assails me In high heaven a blessed dame
Besides who mourns with such effectual grief
That hindrance which I send thee to remove
That Gods stern judgment to her will inclines
To Lucia calling her she thus bespake
Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid
And I commend him to thee At her word
Sped Lucia of all cruelty the foe
And coming to the place where I abode
Seated with Rachel her of ancient days
She thus addressd me Thou true praise of God
Beatrice why is not thy succour lent
To him who so much lovd thee as to leave
For thy sake all the multitude admires
Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail
Nor mark the death which in the torrent flood
Swoln mightier than a sea him struggling holds
Neer among men did any with such speed
Haste to their profit flee from their annoy
As when these words were spoken I came here
Down from my blessed seat trusting the force
Of thy pure eloquence which thee and all
Who well have markd it into honour brings

When she had ended her bright beaming eyes
Tearful she turnd aside whereat I felt
Redoubled zeal to serve thee As she willd
Thus am I come I savd thee from the beast
Who thy near way across the goodly mount
Prevented What is this comes oer thee then
Why why dost thou hang back why in thy breast
Harbour vile fear why hast not courage there
And noble daring Since three maids so blest
Thy safety plan een in the court of heaven
And so much certain good my words forebode

As florets by the frosty air of night
Bent down and closd when day has blanchd their leaves
Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems
So was my fainting vigour new restord
And to my heart such kindly courage ran
That I as one undaunted soon replied
O full of pity she who undertook
My succour and thou kind who didst perform
So soon her true behest With such desire
Thou hast disposd me to renew my voyage
That my first purpose fully is resumd
Lead on one only will is in us both
Thou art my guide my master thou and lord

So spake I and when he had onward movd
I enterd on the deep and woody way




CANTO III

THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe
Through me you pass into eternal pain
Through me among the people lost for aye
Justice the founder of my fabric movd
To rear me was the task of power divine
Supremest wisdom and primeval love
Before me things create were none save things
Eternal and eternal I endure

All hope abandon ye who enter here

Such characters in colour dim I markd
Over a portals lofty arch inscribd
Whereat I thus Master these words import
Hard meaning He as one prepard replied
Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave
Here be vile fear extinguishd We are come
Where I have told thee we shall see the souls
To misery doomd who intellectual good
Have lost And when his hand he had stretchd forth
To mine with pleasant looks whence I was cheerd
Into that secret place he led me on

Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans
Resounded through the air piercd by no star
That een I wept at entering Various tongues
Horrible languages outcries of woe
Accents of anger voices deep and hoarse
With hands together smote that swelld the sounds
Made up a tumult that for ever whirls
Round through that air with solid darkness staind
Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies

I then with error yet encompassd cried
O master What is this I hear What race
Are these who seem so overcome with woe

He thus to me This miserable fate
Suffer the wretched souls of those who livd
Without or praise or blame with that ill band
Of angels mixd who nor rebellious provd
Nor yet were true to God but for themselves
Were only From his bounds Heaven drove them forth
Not to impair his lustre nor the depth
Of Hell receives them lest th accursed tribe
Should glory thence with exultation vain

I then Master what doth aggrieve them thus
That they lament so loud He straight replied
That will I tell thee briefly These of death
No hope may entertain and their blind life
So meanly passes that all other lots
They envy Fame of them the world hath none
Nor suffers mercy and justice scorn them both
Speak not of them but look and pass them by

And I who straightway lookd beheld a flag
Which whirling ran around so rapidly
That it no pause obtaind and following came
Such a long train of spirits I should neer
Have thought that death so many had despoild

When some of these I recognizd I saw
And knew the shade of him who to base fear
Yielding abjurd his high estate Forthwith
I understood for certain this the tribe
Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing
And to his foes These wretches who neer lived
Went on in nakedness and sorely stung
By wasps and hornets which bedewd their cheeks
With blood that mixd with tears droppd to their feet
And by disgustful worms was gatherd there

Then looking farther onwards I beheld
A throng upon the shore of a great stream
Whereat I thus Sir grant me now to know
Whom here we view and whence impelld they seem
So eager to pass oer as I discern
Through the blear light He thus to me in few
This shalt thou know soon as our steps arrive
Beside the woeful tide of Acheron

Then with eyes downward cast and filld with shame
Fearing my words offensive to his ear
Till we had reachd the river I from speech
Abstaind And lo toward us in a bark
Comes on an old man hoary white with eld

Crying Woe to you wicked spirits hope not
Ever to see the sky again I come
To take you to the other shore across
Into eternal darkness there to dwell
In fierce heat and in ice And thou who there
Standest live spirit get thee hence and leave
These who are dead But soon as he beheld
I left them not By other way said he
By other haven shalt thou come to shore
Not by this passage thee a nimbler boat
Must carry Then to him thus spake my guide
Charon thyself torment not so t is willd
Where will and power are one ask thou no more

Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
Of him the boatman oer the livid lake
Around whose eyes glard wheeling flames Meanwhile
Those spirits faint and naked color changd
And gnashd their teeth soon as the cruel words
They heard God and their parents they blasphemd
The human kind the place the time and seed
That did engender them and give them birth

Then all together sorely wailing drew
To the cursd strand that every man must pass
Who fears not God Charon demoniac form
With eyes of burning coal collects them all
Beckning and each that lingers with his oar
Strikes As fall off the light autumnal leaves
One still another following till the bough
Strews all its honours on the earth beneath

Een in like manner Adams evil brood
Cast themselves one by one down from the shore
Each at a beck as falcon at his call

Thus go they over through the umberd wave
And ever they on the opposing bank
Be landed on this side another throng
Still gathers Son thus spake the courteous guide
Those who die subject to the wrath of God
All here together come from every clime
And to oerpass the river are not loth
For so heavens justice goads them on that fear
Is turnd into desire Hence neer hath past
Good spirit If of thee Charon complain
Now mayst thou know the import of his words

This said the gloomy region trembling shook
So terribly that yet with clammy dews
Fear chills my brow The sad earth gave a blast
That lightening shot forth a vermilion flame
Which all my senses conquerd quite and I
Down droppd as one with sudden slumber seizd




CANTO IV

BROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash
Of heavy thunder that I shook myself
As one by main force rousd Risen upright
My rested eyes I movd around and searchd
With fixed ken to know what place it was
Wherein I stood For certain on the brink
I found me of the lamentable vale
The dread abyss that joins a thundrous sound
Of plaints innumerable Dark and deep
And thick with clouds oerspread mine eye in vain
Explord its bottom nor could aught discern

Now let us to the blind world there beneath
Descend the bard began all pale of look
I go the first and thou shalt follow next

Then I his alterd hue perceiving thus
How may I speed if thou yieldest to dread
Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt

He then The anguish of that race below
With pity stains my cheek which thou for fear
Mistakest Let us on Our length of way
Urges to haste Onward this said he movd
And entring led me with him on the bounds
Of the first circle that surrounds th abyss
Here as mine ear could note no plaint was heard
Except of sighs that made th eternal air
Tremble not causd by tortures but from grief
Felt by those multitudes many and vast
Of men women and infants Then to me
The gentle guide Inquirst thou not what spirits
Are these which thou beholdest Ere thou pass
Farther I would thou know that these of sin
Were blameless and if aught they merited
It profits not since baptism was not theirs
The portal to thy faith If they before
The Gospel livd they servd not God aright
And among such am I For these defects
And for no other evil we are lost

Only so far afflicted that we live
Desiring without hope So grief assaild
My heart at hearing this for well I knew
Suspended in that Limbo many a soul
Of mighty worth O tell me sire reverd
Tell me my master I began through wish
Of full assurance in that holy faith
Which vanquishes all error say did eer
Any or through his own or others merit
Come forth from thence whom afterward was blest

Piercing the secret purport of my speech
He answerd I was new to that estate
When I beheld a puissant one arrive
Amongst us with victorious trophy crownd
He forth the shade of our first parent drew
Abel his child and Noah righteous man
Of Moses lawgiver for faith approvd
Of patriarch Abraham and David king
Israel with his sire and with his sons
Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won
And others many more whom he to bliss
Exalted Before these be thou assurd
No spirit of human kind was ever savd

We while he spake ceasd not our onward road
Still passing through the wood for so I name
Those spirits thick beset We were not far
On this side from the summit when I kennd
A flame that oer the darkend hemisphere
Prevailing shind Yet we a little space
Were distant not so far but I in part
Discoverd that a tribe in honour high
That place possessd O thou who every art
And science valust who are these that boast
Such honour separate from all the rest

He answerd The renown of their great names
That echoes through your world above acquires
Favour in heaven which holds them thus advancd
Meantime a voice I heard Honour the bard
Sublime his shade returns that left us late
No sooner ceasd the sound than I beheld
Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps
Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad

When thus my master kind began Mark him
Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen
The other three preceding as their lord
This is that Homer of all bards supreme
Flaccus the next in satires vein excelling
The third is Naso Lucan is the last
Because they all that appellation own
With which the voice singly accosted me
Honouring they greet me thus and well they judge

So I beheld united the bright school
Of him the monarch of sublimest song
That oer the others like an eagle soars
When they together short discourse had held
They turnd to me with salutation kind
Beckning me at the which my master smild
Nor was this all but greater honour still
They gave me for they made me of their tribe
And I was sixth amid so learnd a band

Far as the luminous beacon on we passd
Speaking of matters then befitting well
To speak now fitter left untold At foot
Of a magnificent castle we arrivd
Seven times with lofty walls begirt and round
Defended by a pleasant stream Oer this
As oer dry land we passd Next through seven gates
I with those sages enterd and we came
Into a mead with lively verdure fresh

There dwelt a race who slow their eyes around
Majestically movd and in their port
Bore eminent authority they spake
Seldom but all their words were tuneful sweet

We to one side retird into a place
Open and bright and lofty whence each one
Stood manifest to view Incontinent
There on the green enamel of the plain
Were shown me the great spirits by whose sight
I am exalted in my own esteem

Electra there I saw accompanied
By many among whom Hector I knew
Anchises pious son and with hawks eye
Caesar all armd and by Camilla there
Penthesilea On the other side
Old King Latinus seated by his child
Lavinia and that Brutus I beheld
Who Tarquin chasd Lucretia Catos wife
Marcia with Julia and Cornelia there
And sole apart retird the Soldan fierce

Then when a little more I raisd my brow
I spied the master of the sapient throng
Seated amid the philosophic train
Him all admire all pay him revrence due
There Socrates and Plato both I markd
Nearest to him in rank Democritus
Who sets the world at chance Diogenes
With Heraclitus and Empedocles
And Anaxagoras and Thales sage
Zeno and Dioscorides well read
In natures secret lore Orpheus I markd
And Linus Tully and moral Seneca
Euclid and Ptolemy Hippocrates
Galenus Avicen and him who made
That commentary vast Averroes

Of all to speak at full were vain attempt
For my wide theme so urges that ofttimes
My words fall short of what bechancd In two
The six associates part Another way
My sage guide leads me from that air serene
Into a climate ever vexd with storms
And to a part I come where no light shines




CANTO V

FROM the first circle I descended thus
Down to the second which a lesser space
Embracing so much more of grief contains
Provoking bitter moans There Minos stands
Grinning with ghastly feature he of all
Who enter strict examining the crimes

Gives sentence and dismisses them beneath
According as he foldeth him around
For when before him comes th ill fated soul
It all confesses and that judge severe
Of sins considering what place in hell
Suits the transgression with his tail so oft
Himself encircles as degrees beneath
He dooms it to descend Before him stand
Always a numrous throng and in his turn
Each one to judgment passing speaks and hears
His fate thence downward to his dwelling hurld

O thou who to this residence of woe
Approachest when he saw me coming cried
Minos relinquishing his dread employ
Look how thou enter here beware in whom
Thou place thy trust let not the entrance broad
Deceive thee to thy harm To him my guide
Wherefore exclaimest Hinder not his way
By destiny appointed so tis willd
Where will and power are one Ask thou no more

Now gin the rueful wailings to be heard
Now am I come where many a plaining voice
Smites on mine ear Into a place I came
Where light was silent all Bellowing there groand
A noise as of a sea in tempest torn
By warring winds The stormy blast of hell
With restless fury drives the spirits on
Whirld round and dashd amain with sore annoy

When they arrive before the ruinous sweep
There shrieks are heard there lamentations moans
And blasphemies gainst the good Power in heaven

I understood that to this torment sad
The carnal sinners are condemnd in whom
Reason by lust is swayd As in large troops
And multitudinous when winter reigns
The starlings on their wings are borne abroad
So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls
On this side and on that above below
It drives them hope of rest to solace them
Is none nor een of milder pang As cranes
Chanting their dolrous notes traverse the sky
Stretchd out in long array so I beheld
Spirits who came loud wailing hurried on
By their dire doom Then I Instructor who
Are these by the black air so scourgdThe first
Mong those of whom thou questionst he replied
Oer many tongues was empress She in vice
Of luxury was so shameless that she made
Liking be lawful by promulgd decree
To clear the blame she had herself incurrd
This is Semiramis of whom tis writ
That she succeeded Ninus her espousd
And held the land which now the Soldan rules
The next in amorous fury slew herself
And to Sicheus ashes broke her faith
Then follows Cleopatra lustful queen

There markd I Helen for whose sake so long
The time was fraught with evil there the great
Achilles who with love fought to the end
Paris I saw and Tristan and beside
A thousand more he showd me and by name
Pointed them out whom love bereavd of life

When I had heard my sage instructor name
Those dames and knights of antique days oerpowerd
By pity wellnigh in amaze my mind
Was lost and I began Bard willingly
I would address those two together coming
Which seem so light before the wind He thus
Note thou when nearer they to us approach

Then by that love which carries them along
Entreat and they will come Soon as the wind
Swayd them toward us I thus framd my speech
O wearied spirits come and hold discourse
With us if by none else restraind As doves
By fond desire invited on wide wings
And firm to their sweet nest returning home
Cleave the air wafted by their will along
Thus issud from that troop where Dido ranks
They through the ill air speeding with such force
My cry prevaild by strong affection urgd

O gracious creature and benign who gost
Visiting through this element obscure
Us who the world with bloody stain imbrud
If for a friend the King of all we ownd
Our prayr to him should for thy peace arise
Since thou hast pity on our evil plight
f whatsoeer to hear or to discourse
It pleases thee that will we hear of that
Freely with thee discourse while eer the wind
As now is mute The land that gave me birth
Is situate on the coast where Po descends
To rest in ocean with his sequent streams

Love that in gentle heart is quickly learnt
Entangled him by that fair form from me
Taen in such cruel sort as grieves me still
Love that denial takes from none belovd
Caught me with pleasing him so passing well
That as thou seest he yet deserts me not

Love brought us to one death Caina waits
The soul who spilt our life Such were their words
At hearing which downward I bent my looks
And held them there so long that the bard cried
What art thou pondring I in answer thus
Alas by what sweet thoughts what fond desire
Must they at length to that ill pass have reachd

Then turning I to them my speech addressd
And thus began Francesca your sad fate
Even to tears my grief and pity moves
But tell me in the time of your sweet sighs
By what and how love granted that ye knew
Your yet uncertain wishes She replied
No greater grief than to remember days
Of joy when misry is at hand That kens
Thy learnd instructor Yet so eagerly
If thou art bent to know the primal root
From whence our love gat being I will do
As one who weeps and tells his tale One day
For our delight we read of Lancelot
How him love thralld Alone we were and no
Suspicion near us Ofttimes by that reading
Our eyes were drawn together and the hue
Fled from our alterd cheek But at one point
Alone we fell When of that smile we read
The wished smile rapturously kissd
By one so deep in love then he who neer
From me shall separate at once my lips
All trembling kissd The book and writer both
Were loves purveyors In its leaves that day
We read no more While thus one spirit spake
The other waild so sorely that heartstruck
I through compassion fainting seemd not far
From death and like a corpse fell to the ground

CANTO VI

MY sense reviving that erewhile had droopd
With pity for the kindred shades whence grief
Oercame me wholly straight around I see
New torments new tormented souls which way
Soeer I move or turn or bend my sight
In the third circle I arrive of showrs
Ceaseless accursed heavy and cold unchangd
For ever both in kind and in degree
Large hail discolourd water sleety flaw
Through the dun midnight air streamd down amain
Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell

Cerberus cruel monster fierce and strange
Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog
Over the multitude immersd beneath
His eyes glare crimson black his unctuous beard
His belly large and clawd the hands with which
He tears the spirits flays them and their limbs
Piecemeal disparts Howling there spread as curs
Under the rainy deluge with one side
The other screening oft they roll them round
A wretched godless crew When that great worm
Descried us savage Cerberus he opd
His jaws and the fangs showd us not a limb
Of him but trembled Then my guide his palms
Expanding on the ground thence filled with earth
Raisd them and cast it in his ravenous maw

Een as a dog that yelling bays for food
His keeper when the morsel comes lets fall
His fury bent alone with eager haste
To swallow it so droppd the loathsome cheeks
Of demon Cerberus who thundring stuns
The spirits that they for deafness wish in vain

We oer the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt
Of the heavy tempest passing set our feet
Upon their emptiness that substance seemd

They all along the earth extended lay
Save one that sudden raisd himself to sit
Soon as that way he saw us pass O thou
He cried who through the infernal shades art led
Own if again thou knowst me Thou wast framd
Or ere my frame was broken I replied
The anguish thou endurst perchance so takes
Thy form from my remembrance that it seems
As if I saw thee never But inform
Me who thou art that in a place so sad
Art set and in such torment that although
Other be greater more disgustful none
Can be imagind He in answer thus

Thy city heapd with envy to the brim
Ay that the measure overflows its bounds
Held me in brighter days Ye citizens
Were wont to name me Ciacco For the sin
Of gluttny damned vice beneath this rain
Een as thou seest I with fatigue am worn
Nor I sole spirit in this woe all these
Have by like crime incurrd like punishment

No more he said and I my speech resumd
Ciacco thy dire affliction grieves me much
Even to tears But tell me if thou knowst
What shall at length befall the citizens
Of the divided city whether any just one
Inhabit there and tell me of the cause
Whence jarring discord hath assaild it thus

He then After long striving they will come
To blood and the wild party from the woods
Will chase the other with much injury forth
Then it behoves that this must fall within
Three solar circles and the other rise
By borrowd force of one who under shore
Now rests It shall a long space hold aloof
Its forehead keeping under heavy weight
The other oppressd indignant at the load
And grieving sore The just are two in number
But they neglected Avrice envy pride
Three fatal sparks have set the hearts of all
On fire Here ceasd the lamentable sound
And I continud thus Still would I learn
More from thee farther parley still entreat
Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say
They who so well deservd of Giacopo
Arrigo Mosca and the rest who bent
Their minds on working good Oh tell me where
They bide and to their knowledge let me come
For I am pressd with keen desire to hear
If heavens sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell
Be to their lip assignd He answerd straight
These are yet blacker spirits Various crimes
Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss
If thou so far descendest thou mayst see them
But to the pleasant world when thou returnst
Of me make mention I entreat thee there
No more I tell thee answer thee no more

This said his fixed eyes he turnd askance
A little eyd me then bent down his head
And midst his blind companions with it fell

When thus my guide No more his bed he leaves
Ere the last angeltrumpet blow The Power
Adverse to these shall then in glory come
Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair
Resume his fleshly vesture and his form
And hear the eternal doom reechoing rend
The vault So passd we through that mixture foul
Of spirits and rain with tardy steps meanwhile
Touching though slightly on the life to come
For thus I questiond Shall these tortures Sir
When the great sentence passes be increasd
Or mitigated or as now severe

He then Consult thy knowledge that decides
That as each thing to more perfection grows
It feels more sensibly both good and pain
Though neer to true perfection may arrive
This race accursd yet nearer then than now
They shall approach it Compassing that path
Circuitous we journeyed and discourse
Much more than I relate between us passd
Till at the point where the steps led below
Arrivd there Plutus the great foe we found




CANTO VII

AH me O Satan Satan loud exclaimd
Plutus in accent hoarse of wild alarm
And the kind sage whom no event surprisd
To comfort me thus spake Let not thy fear
Harm thee for power in him be sure is none
To hinder down this rock thy safe descent
Then to that sworn lip turning Peace he cried

Cursd wolf thy fury inward on thyself
Prey and consume thee Through the dark profound
Not without cause he passes So t is willd
On high there where the great Archangel pourd
Heavns vengeance on the first adulterer proud

As sails full spread and bellying with the wind
Drop suddenly collapsd if the mast split
So to the ground down droppd the cruel fiend

Thus we descending to the fourth steep ledge
Gaind on the dismal shore that all the woe
Hems in of all the universe Ah me
Almighty Justice in what store thou heapst
New pains new troubles as I here beheld
Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this

Een as a billow on Charybdis rising
Against encounterd billow dashing breaks
Such is the dance this wretched race must lead
Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found
From one side and the other with loud voice
Both rolld on weights by main forge of their breasts
Then smote together and each one forthwith
Rolld them back voluble turning again
Exclaiming these Why holdest thou so fast
Those answering And why castest thou away
So still repeating their despiteful song
They to the opposite point on either hand
Traversd the horrid circle then arrivd
Both turnd them round and through the middle space
Conflicting met again At sight whereof
I stung with grief thus spake O say my guide
What race is this Were these whose heads are shorn
On our left hand all seprate to the church

He straight replied In their first life these all
In mind were so distorted that they made
According to due measure of their wealth
No use This clearly from their words collect
Which they howl forth at each extremity
Arriving of the circle where their crime
Contrary in kind disparts them To the church
Were separate those that with no hairy cowls
Are crownd both Popes and Cardinals oer whom
Avrice dominion absolute maintains

I then Mid such as these some needs must be
Whom I shall recognize that with the blot
Of these foul sins were staind He answering thus
Vain thought conceivst thou That ignoble life
Which made them vile before now makes them dark
And to all knowledge indiscernible
Forever they shall meet in this rude shock
These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise
Those with closeshaven locks That ill they gave
And ill they kept hath of the beauteous world
Deprivd and set them at this strife which needs
No labourd phrase of mine to set if off
Now mayst thou see my son how brief how vain
The goods committed into fortunes hands
For which the human race keep such a coil
Not all the gold that is beneath the moon
Or ever hath been of these toilworn souls
Might purchase rest for one I thus rejoind

My guide of thee this also would I learn
This fortune that thou speakst of what it is
Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world

He thus O beings blind what ignorance
Besets you Now my judgment hear and mark
He whose transcendent wisdom passes all
The heavens creating gave them ruling powers
To guide them so that each part shines to each
Their light in equal distribution pourd
By similar appointment he ordaind
Over the worlds bright images to rule
Superintendence of a guiding hand
And general minister which at due time
May change the empty vantages of life
From race to race from one to others blood
Beyond prevention of mans wisest care
Wherefore one nation rises into sway
Another languishes een as her will
Decrees from us conceald as in the grass
The serpent train Against her nought avails
Your utmost wisdom She with foresight plans
Judges and carries on her reign as theirs
The other powers divine Her changes know
Nore intermission by necessity
She is made swift so frequent come who claim
Succession in her favours This is she
So execrated een by those whose debt
To her is rather praise they wrongfully
With blame requite her and with evil word
But she is blessed and for that recks not
Amidst the other primal beings glad
Rolls on her sphere and in her bliss exults
Now on our way pass we to heavier woe
Descending for each star is falling now
That mounted at our entrance and forbids
Too long our tarrying We the circle crossd
To the next steep arriving at a well
That boiling pours itself down to a foss
Sluicd from its source Far murkier was the wave
Than sablest grain and we in company
Of the inky waters journeying by their side
Enterd though by a different track beneath
Into a lake the Stygian namd expands
The dismal stream when it hath reachd the foot
Of the grey witherd cliffs Intent I stood
To gaze and in the marish sunk descried
A miry tribe all naked and with looks
Betokning rage They with their hands alone
Struck not but with the head the breast the feet
Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs

The good instructor spake Now seest thou son
The souls of those whom anger overcame
This too for certain know that underneath
The water dwells a multitude whose sighs
Into these bubbles make the surface heave
As thine eye tells thee wheresoeer it turn
Fixd in the slime they say Sad once were we
In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun
Carrying a foul and lazy mist within
Now in these murky settlings are we sad
Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats
But word distinct can utter none Our route
Thus compassd we a segment widely stretchd
Between the dry embankment and the core
Of the loathd pool turning meanwhile our eyes
Downward on those who gulpd its muddy lees
Nor stoppd till to a towers low base we came




CANTO VIII

MY theme pursuing I relate that ere
We reachd the lofty turrets base our eyes
Its height ascended where two cressets hung
We markd and from afar another light
Return the signal so remote that scarce
The eye could catch its beam I turning round
To the deep source of knowledge thus inquird
Say what this means and what that other light
In answer set what agency doth this

There on the filthy waters he replied
Een now what next awaits us mayst thou see
If the marshgenderd fog conceal it not

Never was arrow from the cord dismissd
That ran its way so nimbly through the air
As a small bark that through the waves I spied
Toward us coming under the sole sway
Of one that ferried it who cried aloud
Art thou arrivd fell spiritPhlegyas Phlegyas
This time thou criest in vain my lord replied
No longer shalt thou have us but while oer
The slimy pool we pass As one who hears
Of some great wrong he hath sustaind whereat
Inly he pines so Phlegyas inly pind
In his fierce ire My guide descending steppd
Into the skiff and bade me enter next
Close at his side nor till my entrance seemd
The vessel freighted Soon as both embarkd
Cutting the waves goes on the ancient prow
More deeply than with others it is wont

While we our course oer the dead channel held
One drenchd in mire before me came and said
Who art thou that thou comest ere thine hour

I answerd Though I come I tarry not
But who art thou that art become so foul

One as thou seest who mourn he straight replied

To which I thus In mourning and in woe
Cursd spirit tarry thoug I know thee well
Een thus in filth disguisd Then stretchd he forth
Hands to the bark whereof my teacher sage
Aware thrusting him back Away down there

To the other dogs then with his arms my neck
Encircling kissd my cheek and spake O soul
Justly disdainful blest was she in whom
Thou was conceivd He in the world was one
For arrogance noted to his memory
No virtue lends its lustre even so
Here is his shadow furious There above
How many now hold themselves mighty kings
Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire
Leaving behind them horrible dispraise

I then Master him fain would I behold
Whelmd in these dregs before we quit the lake

He thus Or ever to thy view the shore
Be offerd satisfied shall be that wish
Which well deserves completion Scarce his words
Were ended when I saw the miry tribes
Set on him with such violence that yet
For that render I thanks to God and praise
To Filippo Argenti cried they all
And on himself the moody Florentine
Turnd his avenging fangs Him here we left
Nor speak I of him more But on mine ear
Sudden a sound of lamentation smote
Whereat mine eye unbarrd I sent abroad

And thus the good instructor Now my son
Draws near the city that of Dis is namd
With its grave denizens a mighty throng

I thus The minarets already Sir
There certes in the valley I descry
Gleaming vermilion as if they from fire
Had issud He replied Eternal fire
That inward burns shows them with ruddy flame
Illumd as in this nether hell thou seest

We came within the fosses deep that moat
This region comfortless The walls appeard
As they were framd of iron We had made
Wide circuit ere a place we reachd where loud
The mariner cried vehement Go forth
The entrance is here Upon the gates I spied
More than a thousand who of old from heaven
Were hurld With ireful gestures Who is this
They cried that without death first felt goes through
The regions of the dead My sapient guide
Made sign that he for secret parley wishd
Whereat their angry scorn abating thus
They spake Come thou alone and let him go
Who hath so hardily enterd this realm
Alone return he by his witless way
If well he know it let him prove For thee
Here shalt thou tarry who through clime so dark
Hast been his escort Now bethink thee reader
What cheer was mine at sound of those cursd words
I did believe I never should return

O my lovd guide who more than seven times
Security hast renderd me and drawn
From peril deep whereto I stood exposd
Desert me not I cried in this extreme
And if our onward going be denied
Together trace we back our steps with speed

My liege who thither had conducted me
Replied Fear not for of our passage none
Hath power to disappoint us by such high
Authority permitted But do thou
Expect me here meanwhile thy wearied spirit
Comfort and feed with kindly hope assurd
I will not leave thee in this lower world

This said departs the sire benevolent
And quits me Hesitating I remain
At war twixt will and will not in my thoughts

I could not hear what terms he offerd them
But they conferrd not long for all at once
To trial fled within Closd were the gates
By those our adversaries on the breast
Of my liege lord excluded he returnd
To me with tardy steps Upon the ground
His eyes were bent and from his brow erasd
All confidence while thus with sighs he spake
Who hath denied me these abodes of woe
Then thus to me That I am angerd think
No ground of terror in this trial I
Shall vanquish use what arts they may within
For hindrance This their insolence not new
Erewhile at gate less secret they displayd
Which still is without bolt upon its arch
Thou sawst the deadly scroll and even now
On this side of its entrance down the steep
Passing the circles unescorted comes
One whose strong might can open us this land




CANTO IX

THE hue which coward dread on my pale cheeks
Imprinted when I saw my guide turn back
Chasd that from his which newly they had worn
And inwardly restraind it He as one
Who listens stood attentive for his eye
Not far could lead him through the sable air
And the thickgathring cloud It yet behooves
We win this fightthus he beganif not
Such aid to us is offerdOh how long
Me seems it ere the promisd help arrive

I noted how the sequel of his words
Clokd their beginning for the last he spake
Agreed not with the first But not the less
My fear was at his saying sith I drew
To import worse perchance than that he held
His mutilated speech Doth ever any
Into this rueful concaves extreme depth
Descend out of the first degree whose pain
Is deprivation merely of sweet hope

Thus I inquiring Rarely he replied
It chances that among us any makes
This journey which I wend Erewhile tis true
Once came I here beneath conjurd by fell
Erictho sorceress who compelld the shades
Back to their bodies No long space my flesh
Was naked of me when within these walls
She made me enter to draw forth a spirit
From out of Judas circle Lowest place
Is that of all obscurest and removd
Farthest from heavns allcircling orb The road
Full well I know thou therefore rest secure
That lake the noisome stench exhaling round
The city of grief encompasses which now
We may not enter without rage Yet more
He added but I hold it not in mind
For that mine eye toward the lofty tower
Had drawn me wholly to its burning top
Where in an instant I beheld uprisen
At once three hellish furies staind with blood
In limb and motion feminine they seemd
Around them greenest hydras twisting rolld
Their volumes adders and cerastes crept
Instead of hair and their fierce temples bound

He knowing well the miserable hags
Who tend the queen of endless woe thus spake

Mark thou each dire Erinnys To the left
This is Megaera on the right hand she
Who wails Alecto and Tisiphone
I th midst This said in silence he remaind
Their breast they each one clawing tore themselves
Smote with their palms and such shrill clamour raisd
That to the bard I clung suspicionbound
Hasten Medusa so to adamant
Him shall we change all looking down exclaimd
Een when by Theseus might assaild we took
No ill revenge Turn thyself round and keep
Thy countnance hid for if the Gorgon dire
Be shown and thou shouldst view it thy return
Upwards would be for ever lost This said
Himself my gentle master turnd me round
Nor trusted he my hands but with his own
He also hid me Ye of intellect
Sound and entire mark well the lore conceald
Under close texture of the mystic strain

And now there came oer the perturbed waves
Loudcrashing terrible a sound that made
Either shore tremble as if of a wind
Impetuous from conflicting vapours sprung
That gainst some forest driving all its might
Plucks off the branches beats them down and hurls
Afar then onward passing proudly sweeps
Its whirlwind rage while beasts and shepherds fly

Mine eyes he loosd and spake And now direct
Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam
There thickest where the smoke ascends As frogs
Before their foe the serpent through the wave
Ply swiftly all till at the ground each one
Lies on a heap more than a thousand spirits
Destroyd so saw I fleeing before one
Who passd with unwet feet the Stygian sound
He from his face removing the gross air
Oft his left hand forth stretchd and seemd alone
By that annoyance wearied I perceivd
That he was sent from heavn and to my guide
Turnd me who signal made that I should stand
Quiet and bend to him Ah me how full
Of noble anger seemd he To the gate
He came and with his wand touchd it whereat
Open without impediment it flew

Outcasts of heavn O abject race and scornd
Began he on the horrid grunsel standing
Whence doth this wild excess of insolence
Lodge in you wherefore kick you gainst that will
Neer frustrate of its end and which so oft
Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs
What profits at the fays to but the horn
Your Cerberus if ye remember hence
Bears still peeld of their hair his throat and maw

This said he turnd back oer the filthy way
And syllable to us spake none but wore
The semblance of a man by other care
Beset and keenly pressd than thought of him
Who in his presence stands Then we our steps
Toward that territory movd secure
After the hallowd words We unopposd
There enterd and my mind eager to learn
What state a fortress like to that might hold
I soon as enterd throw mine eye around
And see on every part widestretching space
Replete with bitter pain and torment ill

As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles
Or as at Pola near Quarnaros gulf
That closes Italy and laves her bounds
The place is all thick spread with sepulchres
So was it here save what in horror here
Excelld for midst the graves were scattered flames
Wherewith intensely all throughout they burnd
That iron for no craft there hotter needs

Their lids all hung suspended and beneath
From them forth issud lamentable moans
Such as the sad and torturd well might raise

I thus Master say who are these interrd
Within these vaults of whom distinct we hear
The dolorous sighs He answer thus returnd

The archheretics are here accompanied
By every sect their followers and much more
Than thou believest tombs are freighted like
With like is buried and the monuments
Are different in degrees of heat This said
He to the right hand turning on we passd
Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high




CANTO X

NOW by a secret pathway we proceed
Between the walls that hem the region round
And the tormented souls my master first
I close behind his steps Virtue supreme
I thus began who through these ample orbs
In circuit leadst me even as thou willst
Speak thou and satisfy my wish May those
Who lie within these sepulchres be seen
Already all the lids are raisd and none
Oer them keeps watch He thus in answer spake
They shall be closed all whattime they here
From Josaphat returnd shall come and bring
Their bodies which above they now have left
The cemetery on this part obtain
With Epicurus all his followers
Who with the body make the spirit die
Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon
Both to the question askd and to the wish
Which thou concealst in silence I replied
I keep not guide belovd from thee my heart
Secreted but to shun vain length of words
A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself

O Tuscan thou who through the city of fire
Alive art passing so discreet of speech
Here please thee stay awhile Thy utterance
Declares the place of thy nativity
To be that noble land with which perchance
I too severely dealt Sudden that sound
Forth issud from a vault whereat in fear
I somewhat closer to my leaders side
Approaching he thus spake What dost thou Turn
Lo Farinata there who hath himself
Uplifted from his girdle upwards all
Exposd behold him On his face was mine
Already fixd his breast and forehead there
Erecting seemd as in high scorn he held
Een hell Between the sepulchres to him
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt
This warning added See thy words be clear

He soon as there I stood at the tombs foot
Eyd me a space then in disdainful mood
Addressd me Say what ancestors were thine

I willing to obey him straight reveald
The whole nor kept back aught whence he his brow
Somewhat uplifting cried Fiercely were they
Adverse to me my party and the blood
From whence I sprang twice therefore I abroad
Scatterd them Though drivn out yet they each time
From all parts answerd I returnd an art
Which yours have shown they are not skilld to learn

Then peering forth from the unclosed jaw
Rose from his side a shade high as the chin
Leaning methought upon its knees upraisd
It lookd around as eager to explore
If there were other with me but perceiving
That fond imagination quenchd with tears
Thus spake If thou through this blind prison gost
Led by thy lofty genius and profound
Where is my son and wherefore not with thee

I straight replied Not of myself I come
By him who there expects me through this clime
Conducted whom perchance Guido thy son
Had in contempt Already had his words
And mode of punishment read me his name
Whence I so fully answerd He at once
Exclaimd up starting How saidst thou he HAD
No longer lives he Strikes not on his eye
The blessed daylight Then of some delay
I made ere my reply aware down fell
Supine not after forth appeard he more

Meanwhile the other great of soul near whom
I yet was stationd changd not countnance stern
Nor movd the neck nor bent his ribbed side
And if continuing the first discourse
They in this art he cried small skill have shown
That doth torment me more een than this bed
But not yet fifty times shall be relumd
Her aspect who reigns here Queen of this realm
Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art
So to the pleasant world mayst thou return
As thou shalt tell me why in all their laws
Against my kin this people is so fell

The slaughter and great havoc I replied
That colourd Arbias flood with crimson stain
To these impute that in our hallowd dome
Such orisons ascend Sighing he shook
The head then thus resumd In that affray
I stood not singly nor without just cause
Assuredly should with the rest have stirrd
But singly there I stood when by consent
Of all Florence had to the ground been razd
The one who openly forbad the deed

So may thy lineage find at last repose
I thus adjurd him as thou solve this knot
Which now involves my mind If right I hear
Ye seem to view beforehand that which time
Leads with him of the present uninformd

We view as one who hath an evil sight
He answerd plainly objects far remote
So much of his large spendour yet imparts
The Almighty Ruler but when they approach
Or actually exist our intellect
Then wholly fails nor of your human state
Except what others bring us know we aught
Hence therefore mayst thou understand that all
Our knowledge in that instant shall expire
When on futurity the portals close

Then conscious of my fault and by remorse
Smitten I added thus Now shalt thou say
To him there fallen that his offspring still
Is to the living joind and bid him know
That if from answer silent I abstaind
Twas that my thought was occupied intent
Upon that error which thy help hath solvd

But now my master summoning me back
I heard and with more eager haste besought
The spirit to inform me who with him
Partook his lot He answer thus returnd

More than a thousand with me here are laid
Within is Frederick second of that name
And the Lord Cardinal and of the rest
I speak not He this said from sight withdrew
But I my steps towards the ancient bard
Reverting ruminated on the words
Betokening me such ill Onward he movd
And thus in going questiond Whence the amaze
That holds thy senses wrapt I satisfied
The inquiry and the sage enjoind me straight
Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard
To thee importing harm and note thou this
With his raisd finger bidding me take heed

When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam
Whose bright eye all surveys she of thy life
The future tenour will to thee unfold

Forthwith he to the left hand turnd his feet
We left the wall and towrds the middle space
Went by a path that to a valley strikes
Which een thus high exhald its noisome steam




CANTO XI

UPON the utmost verge of a high bank
By craggy rocks environd round we came
Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stowd
And here to shun the horrible excess
Of fetid exhalation upward cast
From the profound abyss behind the lid
Of a great monument we stood retird

Whereon this scroll I markd I have in charge
Pope Anastasius whom Photinus drew
From the right pathEre our descent behooves
We make delay that somewhat first the sense
To the dire breath accustomd afterward
Regard it not My master thus to whom
Answering I spake Some compensation find
That the time past not wholly lost He then
Lo how my thoughts een to thy wishes tend
My son within these rocks he thus began
Are three close circles in gradation placd
As these which now thou leavst Each one is full
Of spirits accursd but that the sight alone
Hereafter may suffice thee listen how
And for what cause in durance they abide

Of all malicious act abhorrd in heaven
The end is injury and all such end
Either by force or fraud works others woe
But fraud because of man peculiar evil
To God is more displeasing and beneath
The fraudulent are therefore doomd to endure
Severer pang The violent occupy
All the first circle and because to force
Three persons are obnoxious in three rounds
Hach within other seprate is it framd
To God his neighbour and himself by man
Force may be offerd to himself I say
And his possessions as thou soon shalt hear
At full Death violent death and painful wounds
Upon his neighbour he inflicts and wastes
By devastation pillage and the flames
His substance Slayers and each one that smites
In malice plundrers and all robbers hence
The torment undergo of the first round
In different herds Man can do violence
To himself and his own blessings and for this
He in the second round must aye deplore
With unavailing penitence his crime
Whoeer deprives himself of life and light
In reckless lavishment his talent wastes
And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy
To God may force be offerd in the heart
Denying and blaspheming his high power
And nature with her kindly law contemning
And thence the inmost round marks with its seal
Sodom and Cahors and all such as speak
Contemptuously of the Godhead in their hearts

Fraud that in every conscience leaves a sting
May be by man employd on one whose trust
He wins or on another who withholds
Strict confidence Seems as the latter way
Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes
Whence in the second circle have their nest
Dissimulation witchcraft flatteries
Theft falsehood simony all who seduce
To lust or set their honesty at pawn
With such vile scum as these The other way
Forgets both Natures general love and that
Which thereto added afterwards gives birth
To special faith Whence in the lesser circle
Point of the universe dread seat of Dis
The traitor is eternally consumd

I thus Instructor clearly thy discourse
Proceeds distinguishing the hideous chasm
And its inhabitants with skill exact
But tell me this they of the dull fat pool
Whom the rain beats or whom the tempest drives
Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet
Wherefore within the city fireillumd
Are not these punishd if Gods wrath be on them
And if it be not wherefore in such guise
Are they condemned He answer thus returnd
Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind
Not so accustomd or what other thoughts
Possess it Dwell not in thy memory
The words wherein thy ethic page describes
Three dispositions adverse to Heavns will
Incontnence malice and mad brutishness
And how incontinence the least offends
God and least guilt incurs If well thou note
This judgment and remember who they are
Without these walls to vain repentance doomd
Thou shalt discern why they apart are placd
From these fell spirits and less wreakful pours
Justice divine on them its vengeance down

O Sun who healest all imperfect sight
Thou so contentst me when thou solvst my doubt
That ignorance not less than knowledge charms
Yet somewhat turn thee back I in these words
Continud where thou saidst that usury
Offends celestial Goodness and this knot
Perplexd unravel He thus made reply
Philosophy to an attentive ear
Clearly points out not in one part alone
How imitative nature takes her course
From the celestial mind and from its art
And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds
Not many leaves scannd oer observing well
Thou shalt discover that your art on her
Obsequious follows as the learner treads
In his instructors step so that your art
Deserves the name of second in descent
From God These two if thou recall to mind
Creations holy book from the beginning
Were the right source of life and excellence
To human kind But in another path
The usurer walks and Nature in herself
And in her follower thus he sets at nought
Placing elsewhere his hope But follow now
My steps on forward journey bent for now
The Pisces play with undulating glance
Along the horizon and the Wain lies all
Oer the northwest and onward there a space
Is our steep passage down the rocky height




CANTO XII

THE place where to descend the precipice
We came was rough as Alp and on its verge
Such object lay as every eye would shun

As is that ruin which Adices stream
On this side Trento struck shouldring the wave
Or loosd by earthquake or for lack of prop
For from the mountains summit whence it movd
To the low level so the headlong rock
Is shiverd that some passage it might give
To him who from above would pass een such
Into the chasm was that descent and there
At point of the disparted ridge lay stretchd
The infamy of Crete detested brood
Of the feignd heifer and at sight of us
It gnawd itself as one with rage distract

To him my guide exclaimd Perchance thou deemst
The King of Athens here who in the world
Above thy death contrivd Monster avaunt
He comes not tutord by thy sisters art
But to behold your torments is he come

Like to a bull that with impetuous spring
Darts at the moment when the fatal blow
Hath struck him but unable to proceed
Plunges on either side so saw I plunge
The Minotaur whereat the sage exclaimd
Run to the passage while he storms t is well
That thou descend Thus down our road we took
Through those dilapidated crags that oft
Movd underneath my feet to weight like theirs
Unusd I pondring went and thus he spake

Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruind steep
Guarded by the brute violence which I
Have vanquishd now Know then that when I erst
Hither descended to the nether hell
This rock was not yet fallen But past doubt
If well I mark not long ere He arrived
Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil
Of the highest circle then through all its bounds
Such trembling seizd the deep concave and foul
I thought the universe was thrilld with love
Whereby there are who deem the world hath oft
Been into chaos turnd and in that point
Here and elsewhere that old rock toppled down
But fix thine eyes beneath the river of blood
Approaches in the which all those are steepd
Who have by violence injurd O blind lust
O foolish wrath who so dost goad us on
In the brief life and in the eternal then
Thus miserably oerwhelm us I beheld
An ample foss that in a bow was bent
As circling all the plain for so my guide
Had told Between it and the ramparts base
On trail ran Centaurs with keen arrows armd
As to the chase they on the earth were wont

At seeing us descend they each one stood
And issuing from the troop three sped with bows
And missile weapons chosen first of whom
One cried from far Say to what pain ye come
Condemnd who down this steep have journied Speak
From whence ye stand or else the bow I draw

To whom my guide Our answer shall be made
To Chiron there when nearer him we come
Ill was thy mind thus ever quick and rash

Then me he touchd and spake Nessus is this
Who for the fair Deianira died
And wrought himself revenge for his own fate
He in the midst that on his breast looks down
Is the great Chiron who Achilles nursd
That other Pholus prone to wrath Around
The foss these go by thousands aiming shafts
At whatsoever spirit dares emerge
From out the blood more than his guilt allows

We to those beasts that rapid strode along
Drew near when Chiron took an arrow forth
And with the notch pushd back his shaggy beard
To the cheekbone then his great mouth to view
Exposing to his fellows thus exclaimd
Are ye aware that he who comes behind
Moves what he touches The feet of the dead
Are not so wont My trusty guide who now
Stood near his breast where the two natures join
Thus made reply He is indeed alive
And solitary so must needs by me
Be shown the gloomy vale thereto inducd
By strict necessity not by delight
She left her joyful harpings in the sky
Who this new office to my care consignd
He is no robber no dark spirit I
But by that virtue which empowers my step
To treat so wild a path grant us I pray
One of thy band whom we may trust secure
Who to the ford may lead us and convey
Across him mounted on his back for he
Is not a spirit that may walk the air

Then on his right breast turning Chiron thus
To Nessus spake Return and be their guide
And if ye chance to cross another troop
Command them keep aloof Onward we movd
The faithful escort by our side along
The border of the crimsonseething flood
Whence from those steepd within loud shrieks arose

Some there I markd as high as to their brow
Immersd of whom the mighty Centaur thus
These are the souls of tyrants who were given
To blood and rapine Here they wail aloud
Their merciless wrongs Here Alexander dwells
And Dionysius fell who many a year
Of woe wrought for fair Sicily That brow
Whereon the hair so jetty clustring hangs
Is Azzolino that with flaxen locks
Obizzo of Este in the world destroyd
By his foul stepson To the bard reverd
I turned me round and thus he spake Let him
Be to thee now first leader me but next
To him in rank Then farther on a space
The Centaur pausd near some who at the throat
Were extant from the wave and showing us
A spirit by itself apart retird
Exclaimd He in Gods bosom smote the heart
Which yet is honourd on the bank of Thames

A race I next espied who held the head
And even all the bust above the stream
Midst these I many a face rememberd well
Thus shallow more and more the blood became
So that at last it but imbrud the feet
And there our passage lay athwart the foss

As ever on this side the boiling wave
Thou seest diminishing the Centaur said
So on the other be thou well assurd
It lower still and lower sinks its bed
Till in that part it reuniting join
Where t is the lot of tyranny to mourn
There Heavns stern justice lays chastising hand
On Attila who was the scourge of earth
On Sextus and on Pyrrhus and extracts
Tears ever by the seething flood unlockd
From the Rinieri of Corneto this
Pazzo the other namd who filld the ways
With violence and war This said he turnd
And quitting us alone repassd the ford




CANTO XIII

ERE Nessus yet had reachd the other bank
We enterd on a forest where no track
Of steps had worn a way Not verdant there
The foliage but of dusky hue not light
The boughs and tapering but with knares deformd
And matted thick fruits there were none but thorns
Instead with venom filld Less sharp than these
Less intricate the brakes wherein abide
Those animals that hate the culturd fields
Betwixt Corneto and Cecinas stream

Here the brute Harpies make their nest the same
Who from the Strophades the Trojan band
Drove with dire boding of their future woe
Broad are their pennons of the human form
Their neck and countnance armd with talons keen
The feet and the huge belly fledge with wings
These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood

The kind instructor in these words began
Ere farther thou proceed know thou art now
I th second round and shalt be till thou come
Upon the horrid sand look therefore well
Around thee and such things thou shalt behold
As would my speech discredit On all sides
I heard sad plainings breathe and none could see
From whom they might have issud In amaze
Fast bound I stood He as it seemd believd
That I had thought so many voices came
From some amid those thickets close conceald
And thus his speech resumd If thou lop off
A single twig from one of those ill plants
The thought thou hast conceivd shall vanish quite

Thereat a little stretching forth my hand
From a great wilding gatherd I a branch
And straight the trunk exclaimd Why pluckst thou me

Then as the dark blood trickled down its side
These words it added Wherefore tearst me thus
Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast
Men once were we that now are rooted here
Thy hand might well have spard us had we been
The souls of serpents As a brand yet green
That burning at one end from the other sends
A groaning sound and hisses with the wind
That forces out its way so burst at once
Forth from the broken splinter words and blood

I letting fall the bough remaind as one
Assaild by terror and the sage replied
If he O injurd spirit could have believd
What he hath seen but in my verse describd
He never against thee had stretchd his hand
But I because the thing surpassd belief
Prompted him to this deed which even now
Myself I rue But tell me who thou wast
That for this wrong to do thee some amends
In the upper world for thither to return
Is granted him thy fame he may revive

That pleasant word of thine the trunk replied
Hath so inveigled me that I from speech
Cannot refrain wherein if I indulge
A little longer in the snare detaind
Count it not grievous I it was who held
Both keys to Fredericks heart and turnd the wards
Opening and shutting with a skill so sweet
That besides me into his inmost breast
Scarce any other could admittance find
The faith I bore to my high charge was such
It cost me the lifeblood that warmd my veins
The harlot who neer turnd her gloating eyes
From Caesars household common vice and pest
Of courts gainst me inflamd the minds of all
And to Augustus they so spread the flame
That my glad honours changd to bitter woes
My soul disdainful and disgusted sought
Refuge in death from scorn and I became
Just as I was unjust toward myself
By the new roots which fix this stem I swear
That never faith I broke to my liege lord
Who merited such honour and of you
If any to the world indeed return
Clear he from wrong my memory that lies
Yet prostrate under envys cruel blow

First somewhat pausing till the mournful words
Were ended then to me the bard began
Lose not the time but speak and of him ask
If more thou wish to learn Whence I replied
Question thou him again of whatsoeer
Will as thou thinkst content me for no power
Have I to ask such pity is at my heart

He thus resumd So may he do for thee
Freely what thou entreatest as thou yet
Be pleasd imprisond Spirit to declare
How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied
And whether any ever from such frame
Be loosend if thou canst that also tell

Thereat the trunk breathd hard and the wind soon
Changd into sounds articulate like these

Briefly ye shall be answerd When departs
The fierce soul from the body by itself
Thence torn asunder to the seventh gulf
By Minos doomd into the wood it falls
No place assignd but wheresoever chance
Hurls it there sprouting as a grain of spelt
It rises to a sapling growing thence
A savage plant The Harpies on its leaves
Then feeding cause both pain and for the pain
A vent to grief We as the rest shall come
For our own spoils yet not so that with them
We may again be clad for what a man
Takes from himself it is not just he have
Here we perforce shall drag them and throughout
The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung
Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade

Attentive yet to listen to the trunk
We stood expecting farther speech when us
A noise surprisd as when a man perceives
The wild boar and the hunt approach his place
Of stationd watch who of the beasts and boughs
Loud rustling round him hears And lo there came
Two naked torn with briers in headlong flight
That they before them broke each fan o th wood
Haste now the foremost cried now haste thee death

The other as seemd impatient of delay
Exclaiming Lano not so bent for speed
Thy sinews in the lists of Toppos field
And then for that perchance no longer breath
Sufficd him of himself and of a bush
One group he made Behind them was the wood
Full of black female mastiffs gaunt and fleet
As greyhounds that have newly slippd the leash
On him who squatted down they stuck their fangs
And having rent him piecemeal bore away
The torturd limbs My guide then seizd my hand
And led me to the thicket which in vain
Mournd through its bleeding wounds O Giacomo
Of Sant Andrea what avails it thee
It cried that of me thou hast made thy screen
For thy ill life what blame on me recoils

When oer it he had pausd my master spake
Say who wast thou that at so many points
Breathst out with blood thy lamentable speech

He answerd Oh ye spirits arrivd in time
To spy the shameful havoc that from me
My leaves hath severd thus gather them up
And at the foot of their sad parenttree
Carefully lay them In that city I dwelt
Who for the Baptist her first patron changd
Whence he for this shall cease not with his art
To work her woe and if there still remaind not
On Arnos passage some faint glimpse of him
Those citizens who reard once more her walls
Upon the ashes left by Attila
Had labourd without profit of their toil
I slung the fatal noose from my own roof




CANTO XIV

SOON as the charity of native land
Wrought in my bosom I the scatterd leaves
Collected and to him restord who now
Was hoarse with uttrance To the limit thence
We came which from the third the second round
Divides and where of justice is displayd
Contrivance horrible Things then first seen
Clearlier to manifest I tell how next
A plain we reachd that from its sterile bed
Each plant repelld The mournful wood waves round
Its garland on all sides as round the wood
Spreads the sad foss There on the very edge
Our steps we stayd It was an area wide
Of arid sand and thick resembling most
The soil that erst by Catos foot was trod

Vengeance of Heavn Oh how shouldst thou be feard
By all who read what here my eyes beheld

Of naked spirits many a flock I saw
All weeping piteously to different laws
Subjected for on the earth some lay supine
Some crouching close were seated others pacd
Incessantly around the latter tribe
More numerous those fewer who beneath
The torment lay but louder in their grief

Oer all the sand fell slowly wafting down
Dilated flakes of fire as flakes of snow
On Alpine summit when the wind is hushd
As in the torrid Indian clime the son
Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band
Descending solid flames that to the ground
Came down whence he bethought him with his troop
To trample on the soil for easier thus
The vapour was extinguishd while alone
So fell the eternal fiery flood wherewith
The marble glowd underneath as under stove
The viands doubly to augment the pain

Unceasing was the play of wretched hands
Now this now that way glancing to shake off
The heat still falling fresh I thus began
Instructor thou who all things overcomst
Except the hardy demons that rushd forth
To stop our entrance at the gate say who
Is yon huge spirit that as seems heeds not
The burning but lies writhen in proud scorn
As by the sultry tempest immaturd

Straight he himself who was aware I askd
My guide of him exclaimd Such as I was
When living dead such now I am If Jove
Weary his workman out from whom in ire
He snatchd the lightnings that at my last day
Transfixd me if the rest be weary out
At their black smithy labouring by turns
In Mongibello while he cries aloud
Help help good Mulciber as erst he cried
In the Phlegraean warfare and the bolts
Launch he full aimd at me with all his might
He never should enjoy a sweet revenge

Then thus my guide in accent higher raisd
Than I before had heard him Capaneus
Thou art more punishd in that this thy pride
Lives yet unquenchd no torrent save thy rage
Were to thy fury pain proportiond full

Next turning round to me with milder lip
He spake This of the seven kings was one
Who girt the Theban walls with siege and held
As still he seems to hold God in disdain
And sets his high omnipotence at nought
But as I told him his despiteful mood
Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it
Follow me now and look thou set not yet
Thy foot in the hot sand but to the wood
Keep ever close Silently on we passd
To where there gushes from the forests bound
A little brook whose crimsond wave yet lifts
My hair with horror As the rill that runs
From Bulicame to be portiond out
Among the sinful women so ran this
Down through the sand its bottom and each bank
Stonebuilt and either margin at its side
Whereon I straight perceivd our passage lay

Of all that I have shown thee since that gate
We enterd first whose threshold is to none
Denied nought else so worthy of regard
As is this river has thine eye discernd
Oer which the flaming volley all is quenchd

So spake my guide and I him thence besought
That having givn me appetite to know
The food he too would give that hunger cravd

In midst of ocean forthwith he began
A desolate country lies which Crete is namd
Under whose monarch in old times the world
Livd pure and chaste A mountain rises there
Calld Ida joyous once with leaves and streams
Deserted now like a forbidden thing
It was the spot which Rhea Saturns spouse
Chose for the secret cradle of her son
And better to conceal him drownd in shouts
His infant cries Within the mount upright
An ancient form there stands and huge that turns
His shoulders towards Damiata and at Rome
As in his mirror looks Of finest gold
His head is shapd pure silver are the breast
And arms thence to the middle is of brass
And downward all beneath welltemperd steel
Save the right foot of potters clay on which
Than on the other more erect he stands
Each part except the gold is rent throughout
And from the fissure tears distil which joind
Penetrate to that cave They in their course
Thus far precipitated down the rock
Form Acheron and Styx and Phlegethon
Then by this straitend channel passing hence
Beneath een to the lowest depth of all
Form there Cocytus of whose lake thyself
Shall see it I here give thee no account

Then I to him If from our world this sluice
Be thus derivd wherefore to us but now
Appears it at this edge He straight replied
The place thou knowst is round and though great part
Thou have already passd still to the left
Descending to the nethermost not yet
Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb
Wherefore if aught of new to us appear
It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks

Then I again inquird Where flow the streams
Of Phlegethon and Lethe for of one
Thou tellst not and the other of that shower
Thou sayst is formd He answer thus returnd
Doubtless thy questions all well pleasd I hear
Yet the red seething wave might have resolvd
One thou proposest Lethe thou shalt see
But not within this hollow in the place
Whither to lave themselves the spirits go
Whose blame hath been by penitence removd
He added Time is now we quit the wood
Look thou my steps pursue the margins give
Safe passage unimpeded by the flames
For over them all vapour is extinct




CANTO XV

One of the solid margins bears us now
Envelopd in the mist that from the stream
Arising hovers oer and saves from fire
Both piers and water As the Flemings rear
Their mound twixt Ghent and Bruges to chase back
The ocean fearing his tumultuous tide
That drives toward them or the Paduans theirs
Along the Brenta to defend their towns
And castles ere the genial warmth be felt
On Chiarentanas top such were the mounds
So framd though not in height or bulk to these
Made equal by the master whosoeer
He was that raisd them here We from the wood
Were not so far removd that turning round
I might not have discernd it when we met
A troop of spirits who came beside the pier

They each one eyd us as at eventide
One eyes another under a new moon
And toward us sharpend their sight as keen
As an old tailor at his needles eye

Thus narrowly explord by all the tribe
I was agnizd of one who by the skirt
Caught me and cried What wonder have we here

And I when he to me outstretchd his arm
Intently fixd my ken on his parchd looks
That although smirchd with fire they hinderd not
But I rememberd him and towards his face
My hand inclining answerd Sir Brunetto

And art thou here He thus to me My son
Oh let it not displease thee if Brunetto
Latini but a little space with thee
Turn back and leave his fellows to proceed

I thus to him replied Much as I can
I thereto pray thee and if thou be willing
That I here seat me with thee I consent
His leave with whom I journey first obtaind

O son said he whoever of this throng
One instant stops lies then a hundred years
No fan to ventilate him when the fire
Smites sorest Pass thou therefore on I close
Will at thy garments walk and then rejoin
My troop who go mourning their endless doom

I dard not from the path descend to tread
On equal ground with him but held my head
Bent down as one who walks in reverent guise

What chance or destiny thus he began
Ere the last day conducts thee here below
And who is this that shows to thee the way

There up aloft I answerd in the life
Serene I wanderd in a valley lost
Before mine age had to its fullness reachd
But yestermorn I left it then once more
Into that vale returning him I met
And by this path homeward he leads me back

If thou he answerd follow but thy star
Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven
Unless in fairer days my judgment errd
And if my fate so early had not chancd
Seeing the heavns thus bounteous to thee I
Had gladly givn thee comfort in thy work
But that ungrateful and malignant race
Who in old times came down from Fesole
Ay and still smack of their rough mountainflint
Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity
Nor wonder for amongst illsavourd crabs
It suits not the sweet figtree lay her fruit
Old fame reports them in the world for blind
Covetous envious proud Look to it well
Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways For thee
Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve
That thou by either party shalt be cravd
With hunger keen but be the fresh herb far
From the goats tooth The herd of Fesole
May of themselves make litter not touch the plant
If any such yet spring on their rank bed
In which the holy seed revives transmitted
From those true Romans who still there remaind
When it was made the nest of so much ill

Were all my wish fulfilld I straight replied
Thou from the confines of mans nature yet
Hadst not been driven forth for in my mind
Is fixd and now strikes full upon my heart
The dear benign paternal image such
As thine was when so lately thou didst teach me
The way for man to win eternity
And how I prizd the lesson it behooves
That long as life endures my tongue should speak
What of my fate thou tellst that write I down
And with another text to comment on
For her I keep it the celestial dame
Who will know all if I to her arrive
This only would I have thee clearly note
That so my conscience have no plea against me
Do fortune as she list I stand prepard
Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear
Speed fortune then her wheel as likes her best
The clown his mattock all things have their course

Thereat my sapient guide upon his right
Turnd himself back then lookd at me and spake
He listens to good purpose who takes note

I not the less still on my way proceed
Discoursing with Brunetto and inquire
Who are most known and chief among his tribe

To know of some is well thus he replied
But of the rest silence may best beseem
Time would not serve us for report so long
In brief I tell thee that all these were clerks
Men of great learning and no less renown
By one same sin polluted in the world
With them is Priscian and Accorsos son
Francesco herds among that wretched throng
And if the wish of so impure a blotch
Possessd thee him thou also mightst have seen
Who by the servants servant was transferrd
From Arnos seat to Bacchiglione where
His illstraind nerves he left I more would add
But must from farther speech and onward way
Alike desist for yonder I behold
A mist newrisen on the sandy plain
A company with whom I may not sort
Approaches I commend my TREASURE to thee
Wherein I yet survive my sole request

This said he turnd and seemd as one of those
Who oer Veronas champain try their speed
For the green mantle and of them he seemd
Not he who loses but who gains the prize




CANTO XVI

NOW came I where the waters din was heard
As down it fell into the other round
Resounding like the hum of swarming bees
When forth together issud from a troop
That passd beneath the fierce tormenting storm
Three spirits running swift They towards us came
And each one cried aloud Oh do thou stay
Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem
To be some inmate of our evil land

Ah me what wounds I markd upon their limbs
Recent and old inflicted by the flames
Een the remembrance of them grieves me yet

Attentive to their cry my teacher pausd
And turnd to me his visage and then spake
Wait now our courtesy these merit well
And were t not for the nature of the place
Whence glide the fiery darts I should have said
That haste had better suited thee than them

They when we stoppd resumd their ancient wail
And soon as they had reachd us all the three
Whirld round together in one restless wheel
As naked champions smeard with slippery oil
Are wont intent to watch their place of hold
And vantage ere in closer strife they meet
Thus each one as he wheeld his countenance
At me directed so that opposite
The neck movd ever to the twinkling feet

If misery of this drear wilderness
Thus one began added to our sad cheer
And destitute do call forth scorn on us
And our entreaties let our great renown
Incline thee to inform us who thou art
That dost imprint with living feet unharmd
The soil of Hell He in whose track thou seest
My steps pursuing naked though he be
And reft of all was of more high estate
Than thou believest grandchild of the chaste
Gualdrada him they Guidoguerra calld
Who in his lifetime many a noble act
Achievd both by his wisdom and his sword
The other next to me that beats the sand
Is Aldobrandi name deserving well
In the upper world of honour and myself
Who in this torment do partake with them
Am Rusticucci whom past doubt my wife
Of savage temper more than aught beside
Hath to this evil brought If from the fire
I had been shelterd down amidst them straight
I then had cast me nor my guide I deem
Would have restraind my going but that fear
Of the dire burning vanquishd the desire
Which made me eager of their wishd embrace

I then began Not scorn but grief much more
Such as long time alone can cure your doom
Fixd deep within me soon as this my lord
Spake words whose tenour taught me to expect
That such a race as ye are was at hand
I am a countryman of yours who still
Affectionate have utterd and have heard
Your deeds and names renownd Leaving the gall
For the sweet fruit I go that a sure guide
Hath promisd to me But behooves that far
As to the centre first I downward tend

So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs
He answer straight returnd and so thy fame
Shine bright when thou art gone as thou shalt tell
If courtesy and valour as they wont
Dwell in our city or have vanishd clean
For one amidst us late condemnd to wail
Borsiere yonder walking with his peers
Grieves us no little by the news he brings

An upstart multitude and sudden gains
Pride and excess O Florence have in thee
Engenderd so that now in tears thou mournst
Thus cried I with my face upraisd and they
All three who for an answer took my words
Lookd at each other as men look when truth
Comes to their ear If thou at other times
They all at once rejoind so easily
Satisfy those who question happy thou
Gifted with words so apt to speak thy thought
Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime
Returning to behold the radiant stars
When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past
See that of us thou speak among mankind

This said they broke the circle and so swift
Fled that as pinions seemd their nimble feet

Not in so short a time might one have said
Amen as they had vanishd Straight my guide
Pursud his track I followd and small space
Had we passd onward when the waters sound
Was now so near at hand that we had scarce
Heard one anothers speech for the loud din

Een as the river that holds on its course
Unmingled from the mount of Vesulo
On the left side of Apennine toward
The east which Acquacheta higher up
They call ere it descend into the vale
At Forli by that name no longer known
Rebellows oer Saint Benedict rolld on
From the Alpine summit down a precipice
Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads
Thus downward from a craggy steep we found
That this dark wave resounded roaring loud
So that the ear its clamour soon had stunnd

I had a cord that bracd my girdle round
Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take
The painted leopard This when I had all
Unloosend from me so my master bade
I gatherd up and stretchd it forth to him
Then to the right he turnd and from the brink
Standing few paces distant cast it down
Into the deep abyss And somewhat strange
Thus to myself I spake signal so strange
Betokens which my guide with earnest eye
Thus follows Ah what caution must men use
With those who look not at the deed alone
But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill

Quickly shall come he said what I expect
Thine eye discover quickly that whereof
Thy thought is dreaming Ever to that truth
Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears
A man if possible should bar his lip
Since although blameless he incurs reproach
But silence here were vain and by these notes
Which now I sing reader I swear to thee
So may they favour find to latest times
That through the gross and murky air I spied
A shape come swimming up that might have quelld
The stoutest heart with wonder in such guise
As one returns who hath been down to loose
An anchor grappled fast against some rock
Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies
Who upward springing close draws in his feet




CANTO XVII

LO the fell monster with the deadly sting
Who passes mountains breaks through fenced walls
And firm embattled spears and with his filth
Taints all the world Thus me my guide addressd
And beckond him that he should come to shore
Near to the stony causeways utmost edge

Forthwith that image vile of fraud appeard
His head and upper part exposd on land
But laid not on the shore his bestial train
His face the semblance of a just mans wore
So kind and gracious was its outward cheer
The rest was serpent all two shaggy claws
Reachd to the armpits and the back and breast
And either side were painted oer with nodes
And orbits Colours variegated more
Nor Turks nor Tartars eer on cloth of state
With interchangeable embroidery wove
Nor spread Arachne oer her curious loom
As ofttimes a light skiff moord to the shore
Stands part in water part upon the land
Or as where dwells the greedy German boor
The beaver settles watching for his prey
So on the rim that fencd the sand with rock
Sat perchd the fiend of evil In the void
Glancing his tail upturnd its venomous fork
With sting like scorpions armd Then thus my guide
Now need our way must turn few steps apart
Far as to that ill beast who couches there

Thereat toward the right our downward course
We shapd and better to escape the flame
And burning marle ten paces on the verge
Proceeded Soon as we to him arrive
A little further on mine eye beholds
A tribe of spirits seated on the sand
Near the wide chasm Forthwith my master spake
That to the full thy knowledge may extend
Of all this round contains go now and mark
The mien these wear but hold not long discourse
Till thou returnest I with him meantime
Will parley that to us he may vouchsafe
The aid of his strong shoulders Thus alone
Yet forward on the extremity I pacd
Of that seventh circle where the mournful tribe
Were seated At the eyes forth gushd their pangs
Against the vapours and the torrid soil
Alternately their shifting hands they plied
Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply
Their jaws and feet by turns when bitten sore
By gnats or flies or gadflies swarming round

Noting the visages of some who lay
Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire
One of them all I knew not but perceivd
That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch
With colours and with emblems various markd
On which it seemd as if their eye did feed

And when amongst them looking round I came
A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought
That wore a lions countenance and port
Then still my sight pursuing its career
Another I beheld than blood more red
A goose display of whiter wing than curd
And one who bore a fat and azure swine
Picturd on his white scrip addressed me thus
What dost thou in this deep Go now and know
Since yet thou livest that my neighbour here
Vitaliano on my left shall sit
A Paduan with these Florentines am I
Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears exclaiming
O haste that noble knight he who the pouch
With the three beaks will bring This said he writhd
The mouth and lolld the tongue out like an ox
That licks his nostrils I lest longer stay
He ill might brook who bade me stay not long
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turnd

My guide already seated on the haunch
Of the fierce animal I found and thus
He me encouragd Be thou stout be bold
Down such a steep flight must we now descend
Mount thou before for that no power the tail
May have to harm thee I will be i th midst

As one who hath an ague fit so near
His nails already are turnd blue and he
Quivers all oer if he but eye the shade
Such was my cheer at hearing of his words
But shame soon interposd her threat who makes
The servant bold in presence of his lord

I settled me upon those shoulders huge
And would have said but that the words to aid
My purpose came not Look thou clasp me firm

But he whose succour then not first I provd
Soon as I mounted in his arms aloft
Embracing held me up and thus he spake
Geryon now move thee be thy wheeling gyres
Of ample circuit easy thy descent
Think on th unusual burden thou sustainst

As a small vessel backning out from land
Her station quits so thence the monster loosd
And when he felt himself at large turnd round
There where the breast had been his forked tail
Thus like an eel outstretchd at length he steerd
Gathring the air up with retractile claws

Not greater was the dread when Phaeton
The reins let drop at random whence high heaven
Whereof signs yet appear was wrapt in flames
Nor when illfated Icarus perceivd
By liquefaction of the scalded wax
The trusted pennons loosend from his loins
His sire exclaiming loud Ill way thou keepst
Than was my dread when round me on each part
The air I viewd and other object none
Save the fell beast He slowly sailing wheels
His downward motion unobservd of me
But that the wind arising to my face
Breathes on me from below Now on our right
I heard the cataract beneath us leap
With hideous crash whence bending down to explore
New terror I conceivd at the steep plunge

For flames I saw and wailings smote mine ear
So that all trembling close I crouchd my limbs
And then distinguishd unperceivd before
By the dread torments that on every side
Drew nearer how our downward course we wound

As falcon that hath long been on the wing
But lure nor bird hath seen while in despair
The falconer cries Ah me thou stoopst to earth
Wearied descends and swiftly down the sky
In many an orbit wheels then lighting sits
At distance from his lord in angry mood
So Geryon lighting places us on foot
Low down at base of the deepfurrowd rock
And of his burden there dischargd forthwith
Sprang forward like an arrow from the string




CANTO XVIII

THERE is a place within the depths of hell
Calld Malebolge all of rock darkstaind
With hue ferruginous een as the steep
That round it circling winds Right in the midst
Of that abominable region yawns
A spacious gulf profound whereof the frame
Due time shall tell The circle that remains
Throughout its round between the gulf and base
Of the high craggy banks successive forms
Ten trenches in its hollow bottom sunk

As where to guard the walls full many a foss
Begirds some stately castle sure defence
Affording to the space within so here
Were modeld these and as like fortresses
Een from their threshold to the brink without
Are flankd with bridges from the rocks low base
Thus flinty paths advancd that cross the moles
And dikes struck onward far as to the gulf
That in one bound collected cuts them off
Such was the place wherein we found ourselves
From Geryons back dislodgd The bard to left
Held on his way and I behind him movd

On our right hand new misery I saw
New pains new executioners of wrath
That swarming peopled the first chasm Below
Were naked sinners Hitherward they came
Meeting our faces from the middle point
With us beyond but with a larger stride
Een thus the Romans when the year returns
Of Jubilee with better speed to rid
The thronging multitudes their means devise
For such as pass the bridge that on one side
All front toward the castle and approach
Saint Peters fane on th other towards the mount

Each divers way along the grisly rock
Hornd demons I beheld with lashes huge
That on their back unmercifully smote
Ah how they made them bound at the first stripe

None for the second waited nor the third

Meantime as on I passd one met my sight
Whom soon as viewd Of him cried I not yet
Mine eye hath had his fill With fixed gaze
I therefore scannd him Straight the teacher kind
Pausd with me and consented I should walk
Backward a space and the tormented spirit
Who thought to hide him bent his visage down
But it availd him nought for I exclaimd
Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground
Unless thy features do belie thee much
Venedico art thou But what brings thee
Into this bitter seasning He replied
Unwillingly I answer to thy words
But thy clear speech that to my mind recalls
The world I once inhabited constrains me
Know then twas I who led fair Ghisola
To do the Marquis will however fame
The shameful tale have bruited Nor alone
Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn
Rather with us the place is so oerthrongd
That not so many tongues this day are taught
Betwixt the Reno and Savenas stream
To answer SIPA in their countrys phrase
And if of that securer proof thou need
Remember but our craving thirst for gold

Him speaking thus a demon with his thong
Struck and exclaimd Away corrupter here
Women are none for sale Forthwith I joind
My escort and few paces thence we came
To where a rock forth issued from the bank
That easily ascended to the right
Upon its splinter turning we depart
From those eternal barriers When arrivd
Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass
The scourged souls Pause here the teacher said
And let these others miserable now
Strike on thy ken faces not yet beheld
For that together they with us have walkd

From the old bridge we eyd the pack who came
From th other side towards us like the rest
Excoriate from the lash My gentle guide
By me unquestiond thus his speech resumd
Behold that lofty shade who this way tends
And seems too woebegone to drop a tear
How yet the regal aspect he retains
Jason is he whose skill and prowess won
The ram from Colchos To the Lemnian isle
His passage thither led him when those bold
And pitiless women had slain all their males
There he with tokens and fair witching words
Hypsipyle beguild a virgin young
Who first had all the rest herself beguild
Impregnated he left her there forlorn
Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain
Here too Medeas injries are avenged
All bear him company who like deceit
To his have practisd And thus much to know
Of the first vale suffice thee and of those
Whom its keen torments urge Now had we come
Where crossing the next pier the straightend path
Bestrides its shoulders to another arch

Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts
Who jibber in low melancholy sounds
With widestretchd nostrils snort and on themselves
Smite with their palms Upon the banks a scurf
From the foul steam condensd encrusting hung
That held sharp combat with the sight and smell

So hollow is the depth that from no part
Save on the summit of the rocky span
Could I distinguish aught Thus far we came
And thence I saw within the foss below
A crowd immersd in ordure that appeard
Draff of the human body There beneath
Searching with eye inquisitive I markd
One with his head so grimd t were hard to deem
If he were clerk or layman Loud he cried
Why greedily thus bendest more on me
Than on these other filthy ones thy ken

Because if true my memry I replied
I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks
And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung
Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more

Then beating on his brain these words he spake
Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk
Wherewith I neer enough could glut my tongue

My leader thus A little further stretch
Thy face that thou the visage well mayst note
Of that besotted sluttish courtezan
Who there doth rend her with defiled nails
Now crouching down now risen on her feet

Thais is this the harlot whose false lip
Answerd her doting paramour that askd
Thankest me muchSay rather wondrously
And seeing this here satiate be our view




CANTO XIX

WOE to thee Simon Magus woe to you
His wretched followers who the things of God
Which should be wedded unto goodness them
Rapacious as ye are do prostitute
For gold and silver in adultery
Now must the trumpet sound for you since yours
Is the third chasm Upon the following vault
We now had mounted where the rock impends
Directly oer the centre of the foss

Wisdom Supreme how wonderful the art
Which thou dost manifest in heaven in earth
And in the evil world how just a meed
Allotting by thy virtue unto all

I saw the livid stone throughout the sides
And in its bottom full of apertures
All equal in their width and circular each
Nor ample less nor larger they appeard
Than in Saint Johns fair dome of me belovd
Those framd to hold the pure baptismal streams
One of the which I brake some few years past
To save a whelming infant and be this
A seal to undeceive whoever doubts
The motive of my deed From out the mouth
Of every one emergd a sinners feet
And of the legs high upward as the calf
The rest beneath was hid On either foot
The soles were burning whence the flexile joints
Glancd with such violent motion as had snapt
Asunder cords or twisted withs As flame
Feeding on unctuous matter glides along
The surface scarcely touching where it moves
So here from heel to point glided the flames

Master say who is he than all the rest
Glancing in fiercer agony on whom
A ruddier flame doth prey I thus inquird

If thou be willing he replied that I
Carry thee down where least the slope bank falls
He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs

I then As pleases thee to me is best
Thou art my lord and knowst that neer I quit
Thy will what silence hides that knowest thou
Thereat on the fourth pier we came we turnd
And on our left descended to the depth
A narrow strait and perforated close
Nor from his side my leader set me down
Till to his orifice he brought whose limb
Quivring expressd his pang Whoeer thou art
Sad spirit thus reversd and as a stake
Drivn in the soil I in these words began
If thou be able utter forth thy voice

There stood I like the friar that doth shrive
A wretch for murder doomd who een when fixd
Calleth him back whence death awhile delays

He shouted Ha already standest there
Already standest there O Boniface
By many a year the writing playd me false
So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth
For which thou fearedst not in guile to take
The lovely lady and then mangle her

I felt as those who piercing not the drift
Of answer made them stand as if exposd
In mockery nor know what to reply
When Virgil thus admonishd Tell him quick
I am not he not he whom thou believst

And I as was enjoind me straight replied

That heard the spirit all did wrench his feet
And sighing next in woeful accent spake
What then of me requirest If to know
So much imports thee who I am that thou
Hast therefore down the bank descended learn
That in the mighty mantle I was robd
And of a shebear was indeed the son
So eager to advance my whelps that there
My having in my purse above I stowd
And here myself Under my head are draggd
The rest my predecessors in the guilt
Of simony Stretchd at their length they lie
Along an opening in the rock Midst them
I also low shall fall soon as he comes
For whom I took thee when so hastily
I questiond But already longer time
Hath passd since my souls kindled and I thus
Upturnd have stood than is his doom to stand
Planted with fiery feet For after him
One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive
From forth the west a shepherd without law
Fated to cover both his form and mine
He a new Jason shall be calld of whom
In Maccabees we read and favour such
As to that priest his king indulgent showd
Shall be of Frances monarch shown to him

I know not if I here too far presumd
But in this strain I answerd Tell me now
What treasures from St Peter at the first
Our Lord demanded when he put the keys
Into his charge Surely he askd no more
But Follow me Nor Peter nor the rest
Or gold or silver of Matthias took
When lots were cast upon the forfeit place
Of the condemned soul Abide thou then
Thy punishment of right is merited
And look thou well to that illgotten coin
Which against Charles thy hardihood inspird
If reverence of the keys restraind me not
Which thou in happier time didst hold I yet
Severer speech might use Your avarice
Oercasts the world with mourning under foot
Treading the good and raising bad men up
Of shepherds like to you th Evangelist
Was ware when her who sits upon the waves
With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld
She who with seven heads towerd at her birth
And from ten horns her proof of glory drew
Long as her spouse in virtue took delight
Of gold and silver ye have made your god
Diffring wherein from the idolater
But he that worships one a hundred ye
Ah Constantine to how much ill gave birth
Not thy conversion but that plenteous dower
Which the first wealthy Father gaind from thee

Meanwhile as thus I sung he whether wrath
Or conscience smote him violent upsprang
Spinning on either sole I do believe
My teacher well was pleasd with so composd
A lip he listend ever to the sound
Of the true words I utterd In both arms
He caught and to his bosom lifting me
Upward retracd the way of his descent

Nor weary of his weight he pressd me close
Till to the summit of the rock we came
Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier
His cherishd burden there gently he placd
Upon the rugged rock and steep a path
Not easy for the clambring goat to mount

Thence to my view another vale appeard




CANTO XX

AND now the verse proceeds to torments new
Fit argument of this the twentieth strain
Of the first song whose awful theme records
The spirits whelmd in woe Earnest I lookd
Into the depth that opend to my view
Moistend with tears of anguish and beheld
A tribe that came along the hollow vale
In silence weeping such their step as walk
Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth

As on them more direct mine eye descends
Each wondrously seemd to be reversd
At the neckbone so that the countenance
Was from the reins averted and because
None might before him look they were compelld
To advance with backward gait Thus one perhaps
Hath been by force of palsy clean transposd
But I neer saw it nor believe it so

Now reader think within thyself so God
Fruit of thy reading give thee how I long
Could keep my visage dry when I beheld
Near me our form distorted in such guise
That on the hinder parts falln from the face
The tears downstreaming rolld Against a rock
I leant and wept so that my guide exclaimd
What and art thou too witless as the rest
Here pity most doth show herself alive
When she is dead What guilt exceedeth his
Who with Heavens judgment in his passion strives
Raise up thy head raise up and see the man
Before whose eyes earth gapd in Thebes when all
Cried out Amphiaraus whither rushest
Why leavest thou the war He not the less
Fell ruining far as to Minos down
Whose grapple none eludes Lo how he makes
The breast his shoulders and who once too far
Before him wishd to see now backward looks
And treads reverse his path Tiresias note
Who semblance changd when woman he became
Of male through every limb transformd and then
Once more behovd him with his rod to strike
The two entwining serpents ere the plumes
That markd the better sex might shoot again

Aruns with more his belly facing comes
On Lunis mountains midst the marbles white
Where delves Carraras hind who wons beneath
A cavern was his dwelling whence the stars
And mainsea wide in boundless view he held

The next whose loosend tresses overspread
Her bosom which thou seest not for each hair
On that side grows was Manto she who searchd
Through many regions and at length her seat
Fixd in my native land whence a short space
My words detain thy audience When her sire
From life departed and in servitude
The city dedicate to Bacchus mournd
Long time she went a wandrer through the world
Aloft in Italys delightful land
A lake there lies at foot of that proud Alp
That oer the Tyrol locks Germania in
Its name Benacus which a thousand rills
Methinks and more water between the vale
Camonica and Garda and the height
Of Apennine remote There is a spot
At midway of that lake where he who bears
Of Trentos flock the pastral staff with him
Of Brescia and the Veronese might each
Passing that way his benediction give
A garrison of goodly site and strong
Peschiera stands to awe with front opposd
The Bergamese and Brescian whence the shore
More slope each way descends There whatsoever
Benacus bosom holds not tumbling oer
Down falls and winds a river flood beneath
Through the green pastures Soon as in his course
The steam makes head Benacus then no more
They call the name but Mincius till at last
Reaching Governo into Po he falls
Not far his course hath run when a wide flat
It finds which overstretchmg as a marsh
It covers pestilent in summer oft
Hence journeying the savage maiden saw
Midst of the fen a territory waste
And naked of inhabitants To shun
All human converse here she with her slaves
Plying her arts remaind and livd and left
Her body tenantless Thenceforth the tribes
Who round were scatterd gathring to that place
Assembled for its strength was great enclosd
On all parts by the fen On those dead bones
They reard themselves a city for her sake
Calling it Mantua who first chose the spot
Nor askd another omen for the name
Wherein more numerous the people dwelt
Ere Casalodis madness by deceit
Was wrongd of Pinamonte If thou hear
Henceforth another origin assignd
Of that my country I forewarn thee now
That falsehood none beguile thee of the truth

I answerd Teacher I conclude thy words
So certain that all else shall be to me
As embers lacking life But now of these
Who here proceed instruct me if thou see
Any that merit more especial note
For thereon is my mind alone intent

He straight replied That spirit from whose cheek
The beard sweeps oer his shoulders brown what time
Graecia was emptied of her males that scarce
The cradles were supplied the seer was he
In Aulis who with Calchas gave the sign
When first to cut the cable Him they namd
Eurypilus so sings my tragic strain
In which majestic measure well thou knowst
Who knowst it all That other round the loins
So slender of his shape was Michael Scot
Practisd in evry slight of magic wile

Guido Bonatti see Asdente mark
Who now were willing he had tended still
The thread and cordwain and too late repents

See next the wretches who the needle left
The shuttle and the spindle and became
Diviners baneful witcheries they wrought
With images and herbs But onward now
For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine
On either hemisphere touching the wave
Beneath the towers of Seville Yesternight
The moon was round Thou mayst remember well
For she good service did thee in the gloom
Of the deep wood This said both onward movd




CANTO XXI

THUS we from bridge to bridge with other talk
The which my drama cares not to rehearse
Passd on and to the summit reaching stood
To view another gap within the round
Of Malebolge other bootless pangs

Marvelous darkness shadowd oer the place

In the Venetians arsenal as boils
Through wintry months tenacious pitch to smear
Their unsound vessels for th inclement time
Seafaring men restrains and in that while
His bark one builds anew another stops
The ribs of his that hath made many a voyage
One hammers at the prow one at the poop
This shapeth oars that other cables twirls
The mizen one repairs and mainsail rent
So not by force of fire but art divine
Boild here a glutinous thick mass that round
Limd all the shore beneath I that beheld
But therein nought distinguishd save the surge
Raisd by the boiling in one mighty swell
Heave and by turns subsiding and fall While there
I fixd my ken below Mark mark my guide
Exclaiming drew me towards him from the place
Wherein I stood I turnd myself as one
Impatient to behold that which beheld
He needs must shun whom sudden fear unmans
That he his flight delays not for the view
Behind me I discernd a devil black
That running up advancd along the rock
Ah what fierce cruelty his look bespake
In act how bitter did he seem with wings
Buoyant outstretchd and feet of nimblest tread
His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp
Was with a sinner chargd by either haunch
He held him the foots sinew griping fast

Ye of our bridge he cried keentalond fiends
Lo one of Santa Zitas elders Him
Whelm ye beneath while I return for more
That land hath store of such All men are there
Except Bonturo barterers of no
For lucre there an aye is quickly made

Him dashing down oer the rough rock he turnd
Nor ever after thief a mastiff loosd
Sped with like eager haste That other sank
And forthwith writing to the surface rose
But those dark demons shrouded by the bridge
Cried Here the hallowd visage saves not here
Is other swimming than in Serchios wave
Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not
Take heed thou mount not oer the pitch This said
They grappled him with more than hundred hooks
And shouted Coverd thou must sport thee here
So if thou canst in secret mayst thou filch

Een thus the cook bestirs him with his grooms
To thrust the flesh into the caldron down
With fleshhooks that it float not on the top

Me then my guide bespake Lest they descry
That thou art here behind a craggy rock
Bend low and screen thee and whateer of force
Be offerd me or insult fear thou not
For I am well advisd who have been erst
In the like fray Beyond the bridges head
Therewith he passd and reaching the sixth pier
Behovd him then a forehead terrorproof

With storm and fury as when dogs rush forth
Upon the poor mans back who suddenly
From whence he standeth makes his suit so rushd
Those from beneath the arch and against him
Their weapons all they pointed He aloud
Be none of you outrageous ere your time
Dare seize me come forth from amongst you one

Who having heard my words decide he then
If he shall tear these limbs They shouted loud
Go Malacoda Whereat one advancd
The others standing firm and as he came
What may this turn avail him he exclaimd

Believst thou Malacoda I had come
Thus far from all your skirmishing secure
My teacher answered without will divine
And destiny propitious Pass we then
For so Heavens pleasure is that I should lead
Another through this savage wilderness

Forthwith so fell his pride that he let drop
The instrument of torture at his feet
And to the rest exclaimd We have no power
To strike him Then to me my guide O thou
Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit
Low crouching safely now to me return

I rose and towards him moved with speed the fiends
Meantime all forward drew me terror seizd
Lest they should break the compact they had made
Thus issuing from Caprona once I saw
Th infantry dreading lest his covenant
The foe should break so close he hemmd them round

I to my leaders side adherd mine eyes
With fixt and motionless observance bent
On their unkindly visage They their hooks
Protruding one the other thus bespake
Wilt thou I touch him on the hip To whom
Was answerd Even so nor miss thy aim

But he who was in confrence with my guide
Turnd rapid round and thus the demon spake
Stay stay thee Scarmiglione Then to us
He added Further footing to your step
This rock affords not shiverd to the base
Of the sixth arch But would you still proceed
Up by this cavern go not distant far
Another rock will yield you passage safe
Yesterday later by five hours than now
Twelve hundred threescore years and six had filld
The circuit of their course since here the way
Was broken Thitherward I straight dispatch
Certain of these my scouts who shall espy
If any on the surface bask With them
Go ye for ye shall find them nothing fell
Come Alichino forth with that he cried
And Calcabrina and Cagnazzo thou
The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead
With Libicocco Draghinazzo haste
Fangd Ciriatto Grafflacane fierce
And Farfarello and mad Rubicant
Search ye around the bubbling tar For these
In safety lead them where the other crag
Uninterrupted traverses the dens

I then O master what a sight is there
Ah without escort journey we alone
Which if thou know the way I covet not
Unless thy prudence fail thee dost not mark
How they do gnarl upon us and their scowl
Threatens us present tortures He replied
I charge thee fear not let them as they will
Gnarl on t is but in token of their spite
Against the souls who mourn in torment steepd

To leftward oer the pier they turnd but each
Had first between his teeth prest close the tongue
Toward their leader for a signal looking
Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave




CANTO XXII

IT hath been heretofore my chance to see
Horsemen with martial order shifting camp
To onset sallying or in muster rangd
Or in retreat sometimes outstretchd for flight
Lightarmed squadrons and fleet foragers
Scouring thy plains Arezzo have I seen
And clashing tournaments and tilting jousts
Now with the sound of trumpets now of bells
Tabors or signals made from castled heights
And with inventions multiform our own
Or introducd from foreign land but neer
To such a strange recorder I beheld
In evolution moving horse nor foot
Nor ship that tackd by sign from land or star

With the ten demons on our way we went
Ah fearful company but in the church
With saints with gluttons at the taverns mess

Still earnest on the pitch I gazd to mark
All things whateer the chasm containd and those
Who burnd within As dolphins that in sign
To mariners heave high their arched backs
That thence forewarnd they may advise to save
Their threatend vessels so at intervals
To ease the pain his back some sinner showd
Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance

Een as the frogs that of a watry moat
Stand at the brink with the jaws only out
Their feet and of the trunk all else concealed
Thus on each part the sinners stood but soon
As Barbariccia was at hand so they
Drew back under the wave I saw and yet
My heart doth stagger one that waited thus
As it befalls that oft one frog remains
While the next springs away and Graffiacan
Who of the fiends was nearest grappling seizd
His clotted locks and draggd him sprawling up
That he appeard to me an otter Each
Already by their names I knew so well
When they were chosen I observd and markd
How one the other calld O Rubicant
See that his hide thou with thy talons flay
Shouted together all the cursed crew

Then I Inform thee master if thou may
What wretched soul is this on whom their hand
His foes have laid My leader to his side
Approachd and whence he came inquird to whom
Was answerd thus Born in Navarres domain
My mother placd me in a lords retinue
For she had borne me to a losel vile
A spendthrift of his substance and himself
The good king Thibault after that I servd
To peculating here my thoughts were turnd
Whereof I give account in this dire heat

Straight Ciriatto from whose mouth a tusk
Issued on either side as from a boar
Ript him with one of these Twixt evil claws
The mouse had falln but Barbariccia cried
Seizing him with both arms Stand thou apart
While I do fix him on my prong transpiercd
Then added turning to my guide his face
Inquire of him if more thou wish to learn
Ere he again be rent My leader thus
Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt
Knowest thou any sprung of Latian land
Under the tarI parted he replied
But now from one who sojournd not far thence
So were I under shelter now with him
Nor hook nor talon then should scare me more

Too long we suffer Libicocco cried
Then darting forth a prong seizd on his arm
And mangled bore away the sinewy part
Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath
Would next have caught whence angrily their chief
Turning on all sides round with threatning brow
Restraind them When their strife a little ceasd
Of him who yet was gazing on his wound
My teacher thus without delay inquird
Who was the spirit from whom by evil hap
Parting as thou has told thou camst to shore

It was the friar Gomita he rejoind
He of Gallura vessel of all guile
Who had his masters enemies in hand
And usd them so that they commend him well
Money he took and them at large dismissd
So he reports and in each other charge
Committed to his keeping playd the part
Of barterer to the height with him doth herd
The chief of Logodoro Michel Zanche
Sardinia is a theme whereof their tongue
Is never weary Out alas behold
That other how he grins More would I say
But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore

Their captain then to Farfarello turning
Who rolld his moony eyes in act to strike
Rebukd him thus Off cursed bird Avaunt

If ye desire to see or hear he thus
Quaking with dread resumd or Tuscan spirits
Or Lombard I will cause them to appear
Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury
So that no vengeance they may fear from them
And I remaining in this selfsame place
Will for myself but one make sevn appear
When my shrill whistle shall be heard for so
Our custom is to call each other up

Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinnd
Then waggd the head and spake Hear his device
Mischievous as he is to plunge him down

Whereto he thus who faild not in rich store
Of nicewove toils Mischief forsooth extreme
Meant only to procure myself more woe

No longer Alichino then refraind
But thus the rest gainsaying him bespake
If thou do cast thee down I not on foot
Will chase thee but above the pitch will beat
My plumes Quit we the vantage ground and let
The bank be as a shield that we may see
If singly thou prevail against us all

Now reader of new sport expect to hear

They each one turnd his eyes to the other shore
He first who was the hardest to persuade
The spirit of Navarre chose well his time
Planted his feet on land and at one leap
Escaping disappointed their resolve

Them quick resentment stung but him the most
Who was the cause of failure in pursuit
He therefore sped exclaiming Thou art caught

But little it availd terror outstrippd
His following flight the other plungd beneath
And he with upward pinion raisd his breast
Een thus the waterfowl when she perceives
The falcon near dives instant down while he
Enragd and spent retires That mockery
In Calcabrina fury stirrd who flew
After him with desire of strife inflamd
And for the barterer had scapd so turnd
His talons on his comrade Oer the dyke
In grapple close they joind but the other provd
A goshawk able to rend well his foe

And in the boiling lake both fell The heat
Was umpire soon between them but in vain
To lift themselves they strove so fast were glued
Their pennons Barbariccia as the rest
That chance lamenting four in flight dispatchd
From the other coast with all their weapons armd
They to their post on each side speedily
Descending stretchd their hooks toward the fiends
Who flounderd inly burning from their scars
And we departing left them to that broil




CANTO XXIII

IN silence and in solitude we went
One first the other following his steps
As minor friars journeying on their road

The present fray had turnd my thoughts to muse
Upon old Aesops fable where he told
What fate unto the mouse and frog befell
For language hath not sounds more like in sense
Than are these chances if the origin
And end of each be heedfully compard
And as one thought bursts from another forth
So afterward from that another sprang
Which added doubly to my former fear
For thus I reasond These through us have been
So foild with loss and mockry so complete
As needs must sting them sore If anger then
Be to their evil will conjoind more fell
They shall pursue us than the savage hound
Snatches the leveret panting twixt his jaws

Already I perceivd my hair stand all
On end with terror and lookd eager back

Teacher I thus began if speedily
Thyself and me thou hide not much I dread
Those evil talons Even now behind
They urge us quick imagination works
So forcibly that I already feel them

He answerd Were I formd of leaded glass
I should not sooner draw unto myself
Thy outward image than I now imprint
That from within This moment came thy thoughts
Presented before mine with similar act
And countnance similar so that from both
I one design have framd If the right coast
Incline so much that we may thence descend
Into the other chasm we shall escape
Secure from this imagined pursuit

He had not spoke his purpose to the end
When I from far beheld them with spread wings
Approach to take us Suddenly my guide
Caught me evn as a mother that from sleep
Is by the noise arousd and near her sees
The climbing fires who snatches up her babe
And flies neer pausing careful more of him
Than of herself that but a single vest
Clings round her limbs Down from the jutting beach
Supine he cast him to that pendent rock
Which closes on one part the other chasm

Never ran water with such hurrying pace
Adown the tube to turn a landmills wheel
When nearest it approaches to the spokes
As then along that edge my master ran
Carrying me in his bosom as a child
Not a companion Scarcely had his feet
Reachd to the lowest of the bed beneath

When over us the steep they reachd but fear
In him was none for that high Providence
Which placd them ministers of the fifth foss
Power of departing thence took from them all

There in the depth we saw a painted tribe
Who pacd with tardy steps around and wept
Faint in appearance and oercome with toil
Caps had they on with hoods that fell low down
Before their eyes in fashion like to those
Worn by the monks in Cologne Their outside
Was overlaid with gold dazzling to view
But leaden all within and of such weight
That Fredericks compard to these were straw
Oh everlasting wearisome attire

We yet once more with them together turnd
To leftward on their dismal moan intent
But by the weight oppressd so slowly came
The fainting people that our company
Was changd at every movement of the step

Whence I my guide addressd See that thou find
Some spirit whose name may by his deeds be known
And to that end look round thee as thou gost

Then one who understood the Tuscan voice
Cried after us aloud Hold in your feet
Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air
Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish

Whereat my leader turning me bespake
Pause and then onward at their pace proceed

I staid and saw two Spirits in whose look
Impatient eagerness of mind was markd
To overtake me but the load they bare
And narrow path retarded their approach

Soon as arrivd they with an eye askance
Perusd me but spake not then turning each
To other thus conferring said This one
Seems by the action of his throat alive
And be they dead what privilege allows
They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole

Then thus to me Tuscan who visitest
The college of the mourning hypocrites
Disdain not to instruct us who thou art

By Arnos pleasant stream I thus replied
In the great city I was bred and grew
And wear the body I have ever worn
but who are ye from whom such mighty grief
As now I witness courseth down your cheeks
What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe
Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue
One of them answerd are so leaden gross
That with their weight they make the balances
To crack beneath them Joyous friars we were
Bolognas natives Catalano I
He Loderingo namd and by thy land
Together taken as men used to take
A single and indifferent arbiter
To reconcile their strifes How there we sped
Gardingos vicinage can best declare

O friars I began your miseries
But there brake off for one had caught my eye
Fixd to a cross with three stakes on the ground
He when he saw me writhd himself throughout
Distorted ruffling with deep sighs his beard
And Catalano who thereof was ware

Thus spake That pierced spirit whom intent
Thou viewst was he who gave the Pharisees
Counsel that it were fitting for one man
To suffer for the people He doth lie
Transverse nor any passes but him first
Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs
In straits like this along the foss are placd
The father of his consort and the rest
Partakers in that council seed of ill
And sorrow to the Jews I noted then
How Virgil gazd with wonder upon him
Thus abjectly extended on the cross
In banishment eternal To the friar
He next his words addressd We pray ye tell
If so be lawful whether on our right
Lies any opening in the rock whereby
We both may issue hence without constraint
On the dark angels that compelld they come
To lead us from this depth He thus replied
Nearer than thou dost hope there is a rock
From the next circle moving which oersteps
Each vale of horror save that here his cope
Is shatterd By the ruin ye may mount
For on the side it slants and most the height
Rises below With head bent down awhile
My leader stood then spake He warnd us ill
Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook

To whom the friar At Bologna erst
I many vices of the devil heard
Among the rest was said He is a liar
And the father of lies When he had spoke
My leader with large strides proceeded on
Somewhat disturbd with anger in his look

I therefore left the spirits heavy laden
And following his beloved footsteps markd




CANTO XXIV

IN the years early nonage when the sun
Tempers his tresses in Aquarius urn
And now towards equal day the nights recede
When as the rime upon the earth puts on
Her dazzling sisters image but not long
Her milder sway endures then riseth up
The village hind whom fails his wintry store
And looking out beholds the plain around
All whitend whence impatiently he smites
His thighs and to his hut returning in
There paces to and fro wailing his lot
As a discomfited and helpless man
Then comes he forth again and feels new hope
Spring in his bosom finding een thus soon
The world hath changd its countnance grasps his crook
And forth to pasture drives his little flock
So me my guide disheartend when I saw
His troubled forehead and so speedily
That ill was curd for at the fallen bridge
Arriving towards me with a look as sweet
He turnd him back as that I first beheld
At the steep mountains foot Regarding well
The ruin and some counsel first maintaind
With his own thought he opend wide his arm
And took me up As one who while he works
Computes his labours issue that he seems
Still to foresee the effect so lifting me
Up to the summit of one peak he fixd
His eye upon another Grapple that
Said he but first make proof if it be such
As will sustain thee For one cappd with lead
This were no journey Scarcely he though light
And I though onward pushd from crag to crag
Could mount And if the precinct of this coast
Were not less ample than the last for him
I know not but my strength had surely faild
But Malebolge all toward the mouth
Inclining of the nethermost abyss
The site of every valley hence requires
That one side upward slope the other fall

At length the point of our descent we reachd
From the last flag soon as to that arrivd
So was the breath exhausted from my lungs
I could no further but did seat me there

Now needs thy best of man so spake my guide
For not on downy plumes nor under shade
Of canopy reposing fame is won
Without which whosoeer consumes his days
Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth
As smoke in air or foam upon the wave
Thou therefore rise vanish thy weariness
By the minds effort in each struggle formd
To vanquish if she suffer not the weight
Of her corporeal frame to crush her down
A longer ladder yet remains to scale
From these to have escapd sufficeth not
If well thou note me profit by my words

I straightway rose and showd myself less spent
Than I in truth did feel me On I cried
For I am stout and fearless Up the rock
Our way we held more rugged than before
Narrower and steeper far to climb From talk
I ceasd not as we journeyd so to seem
Least faint whereat a voice from the other foss
Did issue forth for uttrance suited ill
Though on the arch that crosses there I stood
What were the words I knew not but who spake
Seemd movd in anger Down I stoopd to look
But my quick eye might reach not to the depth
For shrouding darkness wherefore thus I spake
To the next circle Teacher bend thy steps
And from the wall dismount we for as hence
I hear and understand not so I see
Beneath and naught discernI answer not
Said he but by the deed To fair request
Silent performance maketh best return

We from the bridges head descended where
To the eighth mound it joins and then the chasm
Opening to view I saw a crowd within
Of serpents terrible so strange of shape
And hideous that remembrance in my veins
Yet shrinks the vital current Of her sands
Let Lybia vaunt no more if Jaculus
Pareas and Chelyder be her brood
Cenchris and Amphisboena plagues so dire
Or in such numbers swarming neer she shewd
Not with all Ethiopia and whateer
Above the Erythraean sea is spawnd

Amid this dread exuberance of woe
Ran naked spirits wingd with horrid fear
Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide
Or heliotrope to charm them out of view
With serpents were their hands behind them bound
Which through their reins infixd the tail and head
Twisted in folds before And lo on one
Near to our side darted an adder up
And where the neck is on the shoulders tied
Transpiercd him Far more quickly than eer pen
Wrote O or I he kindled burnd and changd
To ashes all pourd out upon the earth
When there dissolvd he lay the dust again
Uprolld spontaneous and the selfsame form
Instant resumed So mighty sages tell
The Arabian Phoenix when five hundred years
Have well nigh circled dies and springs forthwith
Renascent Blade nor herb throughout his life
He tastes but tears of frankincense alone
And odorous amomum swaths of nard
And myrrh his funeral shroud As one that falls
He knows not how by force demoniac draggd
To earth or through obstruction fettering up
In chains invisible the powers of man
Who risen from his trance gazeth around
Bewilderd with the monstrous agony
He hath endurd and wildly staring sighs
So stood aghast the sinner when he rose

Oh how severe Gods judgment that deals out
Such blows in stormy vengeance Who he was
My teacher next inquird and thus in few
He answerd Vanni Fucci am I calld
Not long since rained down from Tuscany
To this dire gullet Me the beastial life
And not the human pleasd mule that I was
Who in Pistoia found my worthy den

I then to Virgil Bid him stir not hence
And ask what crime did thrust him hither once
A man I knew him choleric and bloody

The sinner heard and feignd not but towards me
His mind directing and his face wherein
Was dismal shame depicturd thus he spake
It grieves me more to have been caught by thee
In this sad plight which thou beholdest than
When I was taken from the other life
I have no power permitted to deny
What thou inquirest I am doomd thus low
To dwell for that the sacristy by me
Was rifled of its goodly ornaments
And with the guilt another falsely charged
But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus
So as thou eer shalt scape this darksome realm
Open thine ears and hear what I forebode
Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines
Then Florence changeth citizens and laws
From Valdimagra drawn by wrathful Mars
A vapour rises wrapt in turbid mists
And sharp and eager driveth on the storm
With arrowy hurtling oer Picenos field
Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst and strike
Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground
This have I told that grief may rend thy heart




CANTO XXV

WHEN he had spoke the sinner raisd his hands
Pointed in mockery and cried Take them God
I level them at thee From that day forth
The serpents were my friends for round his neck
One of then rolling twisted as it said
Be silent tongue Another to his arms
Upgliding tied them riveting itself
So close it took from them the power to move

Pistoia Ah Pistoia why dost doubt
To turn thee into ashes cumbring earth
No longer since in evil act so far
Thou hast outdone thy seed I did not mark
Through all the gloomy circles of the abyss
Spirit that swelld so proudly gainst his God
Not him who headlong fell from Thebes He fled
Nor utterd more and after him there came
A centaur full of fury shouting Where
Where is the caitiff On Maremmas marsh
Swarm not the serpent tribe as on his haunch
They swarmd to where the human face begins
Behind his head upon the shoulders lay
With open wings a dragon breathing fire
On whomsoeer he met To me my guide
Cacus is this who underneath the rock
Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood
He from his brethren parted here must tread
A different journey for his fraudful theft
Of the great herd that near him stalld whence found
His felon deeds their end beneath the mace
Of stout Alcides that perchance laid on
A hundred blows and not the tenth was felt

While yet he spake the centaur sped away
And under us three spirits came of whom
Nor I nor he was ware till they exclaimd
Say who are ye We then brake off discourse
Intent on these alone I knew them not
But as it chanceth oft befell that one
Had need to name another Where said he
Doth Cianfa lurk I for a sign my guide
Should stand attentive placd against my lips
The finger lifted If O reader now
Thou be not apt to credit what I tell
No marvel for myself do scarce allow
The witness of mine eyes But as I looked
Toward them lo a serpent with six feet
Springs forth on one and fastens full upon him
His midmost graspd the belly a forefoot
Seizd on each arm while deep in either cheek
He fleshd his fangs the hinder on the thighs
Were spread twixt which the tail inserted curld
Upon the reins behind Ivy neer claspd
A dodderd oak as round the others limbs
The hideous monster intertwind his own
Then as they both had been of burning wax
Each melted into other mingling hues
That which was either now was seen no more
Thus up the shrinking paper ere it burns
A brown tint glides not turning yet to black
And the clean white expires The other two
Lookd on exclaiming Ah how dost thou change
Agnello See Thou art nor double now

Nor only one The two heads now became
One and two figures blended in one form
Appeard where both were lost Of the four lengths
Two arms were made the belly and the chest
The thighs and legs into such members changd
As never eye hath seen Of former shape
All trace was vanishd Two yet neither seemd
That image miscreate and so passd on
With tardy steps As underneath the scourge
Of the fierce dogstar that lays bare the fields
Shifting from brake to brake the lizard seems
A flash of lightning if he thwart the road
So toward th entrails of the other two
Approaching seemd an adder all on fire
As the dark peppergrain livid and swart
In that part whence our life is nourishd first
One he transpiercd then down before him fell
Stretchd out The pierced spirit lookd on him
But spake not yea stood motionless and yawnd
As if by sleep or fevrous fit assaild
He eyd the serpent and the serpent him
One from the wound the other from the mouth
Breathd a thick smoke whose vapry columns joind

Lucan in mute attention now may hear
Nor thy disastrous fate Sabellus tell
Nor shine Nasidius Ovid now be mute
What if in warbling fiction he record
Cadmus and Arethusa to a snake
Him changd and her into a fountain clear
I envy not for never face to face
Two natures thus transmuted did he sing
Wherein both shapes were ready to assume
The others substance They in mutual guise
So answerd that the serpent split his train
Divided to a fork and the piercd spirit
Drew close his steps together legs and thighs
Compacted that no sign of juncture soon
Was visible the tail disparted took
The figure which the spirit lost its skin
Softning his indurated to a rind
The shoulders next I markd that entring joind
The monsters armpits whose two shorter feet
So lengthend as the others dwindling shrunk
The feet behind then twisting up became
That part that man conceals which in the wretch
Was cleft in twain While both the shadowy smoke
With a new colour veils and generates
Th excrescent pile on one peeling it off
From th other body lo upon his feet
One upright rose and prone the other fell
Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps
Were shifted though each feature changd beneath
Of him who stood erect the mounting face
Retreated towards the temples and what there
Superfluous matter came shot out in ears
From the smooth cheeks the rest not backward draggd
Of its excess did shape the nose and swelld
Into due size protuberant the lips
He on the earth who lay meanwhile extends
His sharpend visage and draws down the ears
Into the head as doth the slug his horns
His tongue continuous before and apt
For uttrance severs and the others fork
Closing unites That done the smoke was laid
The soul transformd into the brute glides off
Hissing along the vale and after him
The other talking sputters but soon turnd
His newgrown shoulders on him and in few
Thus to another spake Along this path
Crawling as I have done speed Buoso now

So saw I fluctuate in successive change
Th unsteady ballast of the seventh hold
And here if aught my tongue have swervd events
So strange may be its warrant Oer mine eyes
Confusion hung and on my thoughts amaze

Yet scapd they not so covertly but well
I markd Sciancato he alone it was
Of the three first that came who changd not thou
The others fate Gaville still dost rue




CANTO XXVI

FLORENCE exult for thou so mightily
Hast thriven that oer land and sea thy wings
Thou beatest and thy name spreads over hell
Among the plundrers such the three I found
Thy citizens whence shame to me thy son
And no proud honour to thyself redounds

But if our minds when dreaming near the dawn
Are of the truth presageful thou ere long
Shalt feel what Prato not to say the rest
Would fain might come upon thee and that chance
Were in good time if it befell thee now
Would so it were since it must needs befall
For as time wears me I shall grieve the more

We from the depth departed and my guide
Remounting scald the flinty steps which late
We downward tracd and drew me up the steep
Pursuing thus our solitary way
Among the crags and splinters of the rock
Sped not our feet without the help of hands

Then sorrow seizd me which een now revives
As my thought turns again to what I saw
And more than I am wont I rein and curb
The powers of nature in me lest they run
Where Virtue guides not that if aught of good
My gentle star or something better gave me
I envy not myself the precious boon

As in that season when the sun least veils
His face that lightens all what time the fly
Gives way to the shrill gnat the peasant then
Upon some cliff reclind beneath him sees
Fireflies innumerous spangling oer the vale
Vineyard or tilth where his daylabour lies
With flames so numberless throughout its space
Shone the eighth chasm apparent when the depth
Was to my view exposd As he whose wrongs
The bears avengd at its departure saw
Elijahs chariot when the steeds erect
Raisd their steep flight for heavn his eyes meanwhile
Straining pursud them till the flame alone
Upsoaring like a misty speck he kennd
Een thus along the gulf moves every flame
A sinner so enfolded close in each
That none exhibits token of the theft

Upon the bridge I forward bent to look
And graspd a flinty mass or else had falln
Though pushd not from the height The guide who markd
How I did gaze attentive thus began

Within these ardours are the spirits each
Swathd in confining fireMaster thy word
I answerd hath assurd me yet I deemd
Already of the truth already wishd
To ask thee who is in yon fire that comes
So parted at the summit as it seemd
Ascending from that funeral pile where lay
The Theban brothers He replied Within
Ulysses there and Diomede endure
Their penal tortures thus to vengeance now
Together hasting as erewhile to wrath
These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore
The ambush of the horse that opend wide
A portal for that goodly seed to pass
Which sowd imperial Rome nor less the guile
Lament they whence of her Achilles reft
Deidamia yet in death complains
And there is rued the stratagem that Troy
Of her Palladium spoildIf they have power
Of uttrance from within these sparks said I
O master think my prayer a thousand fold
In repetition urgd that thou vouchsafe
To pause till here the horned flame arrive
See how toward it with desire I bend

He thus Thy prayer is worthy of much praise
And I accept it therefore but do thou
Thy tongue refrain to question them be mine
For I divine thy wish and they perchance
For they were Greeks might shun discourse with thee

When there the flame had come where time and place
Seemd fitting to my guide he thus began
O ye who dwell two spirits in one fire
If living I of you did merit aught
Whateer the measure were of that desert
When in the world my lofty strain I pourd
Move ye not on till one of you unfold
In what clime death oertook him selfdestroyd

Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn
Began to roll murmuring as a fire
That labours with the wind then to and fro
Wagging the top as a tongue uttering sounds
Threw out its voice and spake When I escapd
From Circe who beyond a circling year
Had held me near Caieta by her charms
Ere thus Aeneas yet had namd the shore
Nor fondness for my son nor reverence
Of my old father nor return of love
That should have crownd Penelope with joy
Could overcome in me the zeal I had
T explore the world and search the ways of life
Mans evil and his virtue Forth I saild
Into the deep illimitable main
With but one bark and the small faithful band
That yet cleavd to me As Iberia far
Far as Morocco either shore I saw
And the Sardinian and each isle beside
Which round that ocean bathes Tardy with age
Were I and my companions when we came
To the strait pass where Hercules ordaind
The boundries not to be oersteppd by man
The walls of Seville to my right I left
On the other hand already Ceuta past

O brothers I began who to the west
Through perils without number now have reachd
To this the short remaining watch that yet
Our senses have to wake refuse not proof
Of the unpeopled world following the track
Of Phoebus Call to mind from whence we sprang
Ye were not formd to live the life of brutes
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high
With these few words I sharpend for the voyage
The mind of my associates that I then
Could scarcely have withheld them To the dawn
Our poop we turnd and for the witless flight
Made our oars wings still gaining on the left
Each star of the other pole night now beheld
And ours so low that from the oceanfloor
It rose not Five times reillumd as oft
Vanishd the light from underneath the moon
Since the deep way we enterd when from far
Appeard a mountain dim loftiest methought
Of all I eer beheld Joy seizd us straight
But soon to mourning changed From the new land
A whirlwind sprung and at her foremost side
Did strike the vessel Thrice it whirld her round
With all the waves the fourth time lifted up
The poop and sank the prow so fate decreed
And over us the booming billow closd




CANTO XVII

NOW upward rose the flame and stilld its light
To speak no more and now passd on with leave
From the mild poet gaind when following came
Another from whose top a sound confusd
Forth issuing drew our eyes that way to look

As the Sicilian bull that rightfully
His cries first echoed who had shapd its mould
Did so rebellow with the voice of him
Tormented that the brazen monster seemd
Piercd through with pain thus while no way they found
Nor avenue immediate through the flame
Into its language turnd the dismal words
But soon as they had won their passage forth
Up from the point which vibrating obeyd
Their motion at the tongue these sounds we heard
O thou to whom I now direct my voice
That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase

Depart thou I solicit thee no more
Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive
Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile
And with me parley lo it irks not me
And yet I burn If but een now thou fall
into this blind world from that pleasant land
Of Latium whence I draw my sum of guilt
Tell me if those who in Romagna dwell
Have peace or war For of the mountains there
Was I betwixt Urbino and the height
Whence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood

Leaning I listend yet with heedful ear
When as he touchd my side the leader thus
Speak thou he is a Latian My reply
Was ready and I spake without delay

O spirit who art hidden here below
Never was thy Romagna without war
In her proud tyrants bosoms nor is now
But open war there left I none The state
Ravenna hath maintaind this many a year
Is steadfast There Polentas eagle broods
And in his broad circumference of plume
Oershadows Cervia The green talons grasp
The land that stood erewhile the proof so long
And pild in bloody heap the host of France

The old mastiff of Verruchio and the young
That tore Montagna in their wrath still make
Where they are wont an augre of their fangs

Lamones city and Santernos range
Under the lion of the snowy lair
Inconstant partisan that changeth sides
Or ever summer yields to winters frost
And she whose flank is washd of Savios wave
As twixt the level and the steep she lies
Lives so twixt tyrant power and liberty

Now tell us I entreat thee who art thou
Be not more hard than others In the world
So may thy name still rear its forehead high

Then roard awhile the fire its sharpend point
On either side wavd and thus breathd at last
If I did think my answer were to one
Who ever could return unto the world
This flame should rest unshaken But since neer
If true be told me any from this depth
Has found his upward way I answer thee
Nor fear lest infamy record the words

A man of arms at first I clothd me then
In good Saint Francis girdle hoping so
T have made amends And certainly my hope
Had faild not but that he whom curses light on
The high priest again seducd me into sin
And how and wherefore listen while I tell
Long as this spirit movd the bones and pulp
My mother gave me less my deeds bespake
The nature of the lion than the fox
All ways of winding subtlety I knew
And with such art conducted that the sound
Reachd the worlds limit Soon as to that part
Of life I found me come when each behoves
To lower sails and gather in the lines
That which before had pleased me then I rued
And to repentance and confession turnd
Wretch that I was and well it had bested me
The chief of the new Pharisees meantime
Waging his warfare near the Lateran
Not with the Saracens or Jews his foes
All Christians were nor against Acre one
Had fought nor trafficd in the Soldans land
He his great charge nor sacred ministry
In himself revrencd nor in me that cord
Which usd to mark with leanness whom it girded
As in Socrate Constantine besought
To cure his leprosy Sylvesters aid
So me to cure the fever of his pride
This man besought my counsel to that end
He askd and I was silent for his words
Seemd drunken but forthwith he thus resumd
From thy heart banish fear of all offence
I hitherto absolve thee In return
Teach me my purpose so to execute
That Penestrino cumber earth no more
Heavn as thou knowest I have power to shut
And open and the keys are therefore twain
The which my predecessor meanly prizd

Then yielding to the forceful arguments
Of silence as more perilous I deemd
And answerd Father since thou washest me
Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall
Large promise with performance scant be sure
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat

When I was numberd with the dead then came
Saint Francis for me but a cherub dark
He met who cried Wrong me not he is mine
And must below to join the wretched crew
For the deceitful counsel which he gave
Eer since I watchd him hovring at his hair
No power can the impenitent absolve
Nor to repent and will at once consist
By contradiction absolute forbid
Oh misry how I shook myself when he
Seizd me and cried Thou haply thoughtst me not
A disputant in logic so exact
To Minos down he bore me and the judge
Twind eight times round his callous back the tail
Which biting with excess of rage he spake
This is a guilty soul that in the fire
Must vanish Hence perditiondoomd I rove
A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb

When he had thus fulfilld his words the flame
In dolour parted beating to and fro
And writhing its sharp horn We onward went
I and my leader up along the rock
Far as another arch that overhangs
The foss wherein the penalty is paid
Of those who load them with committed sin




CANTO XXVIII

WHO een in words unfetterd might at full
Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw
Though he repeated oft the tale No tongue
So vast a theme could equal speech and thought
Both impotent alike If in one band
Collected stood the people all who eer
Pourd on Apulias happy soil their blood
Slain by the Trojans and in that long war
When of the rings the measurd booty made
A pile so high as Romes historian writes
Who errs not with the multitude that felt
The grinding force of Guiscards Norman steel
And those the rest whose bones are gatherd yet
At Ceperano there where treachery
Branded th Apulian name or where beyond
Thy walls O Tagliacozzo without arms
The old Alardo conquerd and his limbs
One were to show transpiercd another his
Clean lopt away a spectacle like this
Were but a thing of nought to the hideous sight
Of the ninth chasm A rundlet that hath lost
Its middle or side stave gapes not so wide
As one I markd torn from the chin throughout
Down to the hinder passage twixt the legs
Dangling his entrails hung the midriff lay
Open to view and wretched ventricle
That turns th englutted aliment to dross

Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze
He eyd me with his hands laid his breast bare
And cried Now mark how I do rip me lo

How is Mohammed mangled before me
Walks Ali weeping from the chin his face
Cleft to the forelock and the others all
Whom here thou seest while they livd did sow
Scandal and schism and therefore thus are rent
A fiend is here behind who with his sword
Hacks us thus cruelly slivering again
Each of this ream when we have compast round
The dismal way for first our gashes close
Ere we repass before him But say who
Art thou that standest musing on the rock
Haply so lingering to delay the pain
Sentencd upon thy crimesHim death not yet
My guide rejoind hath overtaen nor sin
Conducts to torment but that he may make
Full trial of your state I who am dead
Must through the depths of hell from orb to orb
Conduct him Trust my words for they are true

More than a hundred spirits when that they heard
Stood in the foss to mark me through amazed
Forgetful of their pangs Thou who perchance
Shalt shortly view the sun this warning thou
Bear to Dolcino bid him if he wish not
Here soon to follow me that with good store
Of food he arm him lest imprisning snows
Yield him a victim to Novaras power
No easy conquest else With foot upraisd
For stepping spake Mohammed on the ground
Then fixd it to depart Another shade
Piercd in the throat his nostrils mutilate
Een from beneath the eyebrows and one ear
Lopt off who with the rest through wonder stood
Gazing before the rest advancd and bard
His windpipe that without was all oersmeard
With crimson stain O thou said he whom sin
Condemns not and whom erst unless too near
Resemblance do deceive me I aloft
Have seen on Latian ground call thou to mind
Piero of Medicina if again
Returning thou beholdst the pleasant land
That from Vercelli slopes to Mercabo

And there instruct the twain whom Fano boasts
Her worthiest sons Guido and Angelo
That if t is givn us here to scan aright
The future they out of lifes tenement
Shall be cast forth and whelmd under the waves
Near to Cattolica through perfidy
Of a fell tyrant Twixt the Cyprian isle
And Balearic neer hath Neptune seen
An injury so foul by pirates done
Or Argive crew of old That oneeyd traitor
Whose realm there is a spirit here were fain
His eye had still lackd sight of them shall bring
To confrence with him then so shape his end
That they shall need not gainst Focaras wind
Offer up vow nor prayr I answering thus

Declare as thou dost wish that I above
May carry tidings of thee who is he
In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance

Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheekbone
Of one his fellowspirit and his jaws
Expanding cried Lo this is he I wot of
He speaks not for himself the outcast this
Who overwhelmd the doubt in Caesars mind
Affirming that delay to men prepard
Was ever harmful Oh how terrified
Methought was Curio from whose throat was cut
The tongue which spake that hardy word Then one
Maimd of each hand uplifted in the gloom
The bleeding stumps that they with gory spots
Sullied his face and cried Remember thee
Of Mosca too I who alas exclaimd
The deed once done there is an end that provd
A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race

I added Ay and death to thine own tribe

Whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off
As one grief stung to madness But I there
Still lingerd to behold the troop and saw
Things such as I may fear without more proof
To tell of but that conscience makes me firm
The boon companion who her strong breastplate
Buckles on him that feels no guilt within
And bids him on and fear not Without doubt
I saw and yet it seems to pass before me
A headless trunk that even as the rest
Of the sad flock pacd onward By the hair
It bore the severd member lanternwise
Pendent in hand which lookd at us and said

Woes me The spirit lighted thus himself
And two there were in one and one in two
How that may be he knows who ordereth so

When at the bridges foot direct he stood
His arm aloft he reard thrusting the head
Full in our view that nearer we might hear
The words which thus it utterd Now behold
This grievous torment thou who breathing gost
To spy the dead behold if any else
Be terrible as this And that on earth
Thou mayst bear tidings of me know that I
Am Bertrand he of Born who gave King John
The counsel mischievous Father and son
I set at mutual war For Absalom
And David more did not Ahitophel
Spurring them on maliciously to strife
For parting those so closely knit my brain
Parted alas I carry from its source
That in this trunk inhabits Thus the law
Of retribution fiercely works in me




CANTO XXIX

SO were mine eyes inebriate with view
Of the vast multitude whom various wounds
Disfigurd that they longd to stay and weep

But Virgil rousd me What yet gazest on
Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below
Among the maimd and miserable shades
Thou hast not shewn in any chasm beside
This weakness Know if thou wouldst number them
That two and twenty miles the valley winds
Its circuit and already is the moon
Beneath our feet the time permitted now
Is short and more not seen remains to see

If thou I straight replied hadst weighd the cause
For which I lookd thou hadst perchance excusd
The tarrying still My leader part pursud
His way the while I followd answering him
And adding thus Within that cave I deem
Whereon so fixedly I held my ken
There is a spirit dwells one of my blood
Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear

Then spake my master Let thy soul no more
Afflict itself for him Direct elsewhere
Its thought and leave him At the bridges foot
I markd how he did point with menacing look
At thee and heard him by the others namd
Geri of Bello Thou so wholly then
Wert busied with his spirit who once ruld
The towers of Hautefort that thou lookedst not
That way ere he was goneO guide belovd
His violent death yet unavengd said I
By any who are partners in his shame
Made him contemptuous therefore as I think
He passd me speechless by and doing so
Hath made me more compassionate his fate

So we discoursd to where the rock first showd
The other valley had more light been there
Een to the lowest depth Soon as we came
Oer the last cloister in the dismal rounds
Of Malebolge and the brotherhood
Were to our view exposd then many a dart
Of sore lament assaild me headed all
With points of thrilling pity that I closd
Both ears against the volley with mine hands

As were the torment if each lazarhouse
Of Valdichiana in the sultry time
Twixt July and September with the isle
Sardinia and Maremmas pestilent fen
Had heapd their maladies all in one foss
Together such was here the torment dire
The stench as issuing steams from festerd limbs

We on the utmost shore of the long rock
Descended still to leftward Then my sight
Was livelier to explore the depth wherein
The minister of the most mighty Lord
Allsearching Justice dooms to punishment
The forgers noted on her dread record

More rueful was it not methinks to see
The nation in Aegina droop what time
Each living thing een to the little worm
All fell so full of malice was the air
And afterward as bards of yore have told
The ancient people were restord anew
From seed of emmets than was here to see
The spirits that languishd through the murky vale
Uppild on many a stack Confusd they lay
One oer the belly oer the shoulders one
Rolld of another sideling crawld a third
Along the dismal pathway Step by step
We journeyd on in silence looking round
And listning those diseasd who strove in vain
To lift their forms Then two I markd that sat
Proppd gainst each other as two brazen pans
Set to retain the heat From head to foot
A tetter barkd them round Nor saw I eer
Groom currying so fast for whom his lord
Impatient waited or himself perchance
Tird with long watching as of these each one
Plied quickly his keen nails through furiousness
Of neer abated pruriency The crust
Came drawn from underneath in flakes like scales
Scrapd from the bream or fish of broader mail

O thou who with thy fingers rendest off
Thy coat of proof thus spake my guide to one
And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them
Tell me if any born of Latian land
Be among these within so may thy nails
Serve thee for everlasting to this toil

Both are of Latium weeping he replied
Whom torturd thus thou seest but who art thou
That hast inquird of us To whom my guide
One that descend with this man who yet lives
From rock to rock and show him hells abyss

Then started they asunder and each turnd
Trembling toward us with the rest whose ear
Those words redounding struck To me my liege
Addressd him Speak to them whateer thou list

And I therewith began So may no time
Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men
In th upper world but after many suns
Survive it as ye tell me who ye are
And of what race ye come Your punishment
Unseemly and disgustful in its kind
Deter you not from opening thus much to me

Arezzo was my dwelling answerd one
And me Albero of Sienna brought
To die by fire but that for which I died
Leads me not here True is in sport I told him
That I had learnd to wing my flight in air
And he admiring much as he was void
Of wisdom willd me to declare to him
The secret of mine art and only hence
Because I made him not a Daedalus
Prevaild on one supposd his sire to burn me
But Minos to this chasm last of the ten
For that I practisd alchemy on earth
Has doomd me Him no subterfuge eludes

Then to the bard I spake Was ever race
Light as Siennas Sure not France herself
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain

The other leprous spirit heard my words
And thus returnd Be Stricca from this charge
Exempted he who knew so temprately
To lay out fortunes gifts and Niccolo
Who first the spices costly luxury
Discoverd in that garden where such seed
Roots deepest in the soil and be that troop
Exempted with whom Caccia of Asciano
Lavishd his vineyards and widespreading woods
And his rare wisdom Abbagliato showd
A spectacle for all That thou mayst know
Who seconds thee against the Siennese
Thus gladly bend this way thy sharpend sight
That well my face may answer to thy ken
So shalt thou see I am Capocchios ghost
Who forgd transmuted metals by the power
Of alchemy and if I scan thee right
Thus needs must well remember how I aped
Creative nature by my subtle art




CANTO XXX

WHAT time resentment burnd in Junos breast
For Semele against the Theban blood
As more than once in dire mischance was rued
Such fatal frenzy seizd on Athamas
That he his spouse beholding with a babe
Laden on either arm Spread out he cried
The meshes that I take the lioness
And the young lions at the pass then forth
Stretchd he his merciless talons grasping one
One helpless innocent Learchus namd
Whom swinging down he dashd upon a rock
And with her other burden selfdestroyd
The hapless mother plungd and when the pride
Of allpresuming Troy fell from its height
By fortune overwhelmd and the old king
With his realm perishd then did Hecuba
A wretch forlorn and captive when she saw
Polyxena first slaughterd and her son
Her Polydorus on the wild seabeach
Next met the mourners view then reft of sense
Did she run barking even as a dog
Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul
Bet neer the Furies or of Thebes or Troy
With such fell cruelty were seen their goads
Infixing in the limbs of man or beast
As now two pale and naked ghost I saw
That gnarling wildly scamperd like the swine
Excluded from his stye One reachd Capocchio
And in the neckjoint sticking deep his fangs
Draggd him that oer the solid pavement rubbd
His belly stretchd out prone The other shape
He of Arezzo there left trembling spake
That sprite of air is Schicchi in like mood
Of random mischief vent he still his spite

To whom I answring Oh as thou dost hope
The other may not flesh its jaws on thee
Be patient to inform us who it is
Ere it speed henceThat is the ancient soul
Of wretched Myrrha he replied who burnd
With most unholy flame for her own sire

And a false shape assuming so performd
The deed of sin een as the other there
That onward passes dard to counterfeit
Donatis features to feignd testament
The seal affixing that himself might gain
For his own share the lady of the herd

When vanishd the two furious shades on whom
Mine eye was held I turnd it back to view
The other cursed spirits One I saw
In fashion like a lute had but the groin
Been severd where it meets the forked part
Swoln dropsy disproportioning the limbs
With illconverted moisture that the paunch
Suits not the visage opend wide his lips
Gasping as in the hectic man for drought
One towards the chin the other upward curld

O ye who in this world of misery
Wherefore I know not are exempt from pain
Thus he began attentively regard
Adamos woe When living full supply
Neer lackd me of what most I coveted
One drop of water now alas I crave
The rills that glitter down the grassy slopes
Of Casentino making fresh and soft
The banks whereby they glide to Arnos stream
Stand ever in my view and not in vain
For more the picturd semblance dries me up
Much more than the disease which makes the flesh
Desert these shriveld cheeks So from the place
Where I transgressd stern justice urging me
Takes means to quicken more my labring sighs
There is Romena where I falsified
The metal with the Baptists form imprest
For which on earth I left my body burnt
But if I here might see the sorrowing soul
Of Guido Alessandro or their brother
For Brandas limpid spring I would not change
The welcome sight One is een now within
If truly the mad spirits tell that round
Are wandring But wherein besteads me that
My limbs are fetterd Were I but so light
That I each hundred years might move one inch
I had set forth already on this path
Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew
Although eleven miles it wind not more
Than half of one across They brought me down
Among this tribe inducd by them I stampd
The florens with three carats of alloy

Who are that abject pair I next inquird
That closely bounding thee upon thy right
Lie smoking like a band in winter steepd
In the chill streamWhen to this gulf I dropt
He answerd here I found them since that hour
They have not turnd nor ever shall I ween
Till time hath run his course One is that dame
The false accuser of the Hebrew youth
Sinon the other that false Greek from Troy
Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out
In such a cloud upsteamd When that he heard
One galld perchance to be so darkly namd
With clenchd hand smote him on the braced paunch
That like a drum resounded but forthwith
Adamo smote him on the face the blow
Returning with his arm that seemd as hard

Though my oerweighty limbs have taen from me
The power to move said he I have an arm
At liberty for such employ To whom
Was answerd When thou wentest to the fire
Thou hadst it not so ready at command
Then readier when it coind th impostor gold

And thus the dropsied Ay now speakst thou true
But there thou gavst not such true testimony
When thou wast questiond of the truth at Troy

If I spake false thou falsely stampdst the coin
Said Sinon I am here but for one fault
And thou for more than any imp beside

Remember he replied O perjurd one
The horse remember that did teem with death
And all the world be witness to thy guilt

To thine returnd the Greek witness the thirst
Whence thy tongue cracks witness the fluid mound
Reard by thy belly up before thine eyes
A mass corrupt To whom the coiner thus
Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass
Its evil saying Me if thirst assails
Yet I am stuffd with moisture Thou art parchd
Pains rack thy head no urging wouldst thou need
To make thee lap Narcissus mirror up

I was all fixd to listen when my guide
Admonishd Now beware a little more
And I do quarrel with thee I perceivd
How angrily he spake and towards him turnd
With shame so poignant as rememberd yet
Confounds me As a man that dreams of harm
Befalln him dreaming wishes it a dream
And that which is desires as if it were not
Such then was I who wanting power to speak
Wishd to excuse myself and all the while
Excusd me though unweeting that I did

More grievous fault than thine has been less shame
My master cried might expiate Therefore cast
All sorrow from thy soul and if again
Chance bring thee where like conference is held
Think I am ever at thy side To hear
Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds




CANTO XXXI

THE very tongue whose keen reproof before
Had wounded me that either cheek was staind
Now ministerd my cure So have I heard
Achilles and his fathers javelin causd
Pain first and then the boon of health restord

Turning our back upon the vale of woe
W crossd th encircled mound in silence There
Was twilight dim that far long the gloom
Mine eye advancd not but I heard a horn
Sounded aloud The peal it blew had made
The thunder feeble Following its course
The adverse way my strained eyes were bent
On that one spot So terrible a blast
Orlando blew not when that dismal rout
Oerthrew the host of Charlemagne and quenchd
His saintly warfare Thitherward not long
My head was raisd when many lofty towers
Methought I spied Master said I what land
Is this He answerd straight Too long a space
Of intervening darkness has thine eye
To traverse thou hast therefore widely errd
In thy imagining Thither arrivd
Thou well shalt see how distance can delude
The sense A little therefore urge thee on

Then tenderly he caught me by the hand
Yet know said he ere farther we advance
That it less strange may seem these are not towers
But giants In the pit they stand immersd
Each from his navel downward round the bank

As when a fog disperseth gradually
Our vision traces what the mist involves
Condensd in air so piercing through the gross
And gloomy atmosphere as more and more
We neard toward the brink mine error fled
And fear came oer me As with circling round
Of turrets Montereggion crowns his walls
Een thus the shore encompassing th abyss
Was turreted with giants half their length
Uprearing horrible whom Jove from heavn
Yet threatens when his muttring thunder rolls

Of one already I descried the face
Shoulders and breast and of the belly huge
Great part and both arms down along his ribs

Allteeming nature when her plastic hand
Left framing of these monsters did display
Past doubt her wisdom taking from mad War
Such slaves to do his bidding and if she
Repent her not of th elephant and whale
Who ponders well confesses her therein
Wiser and more discreet for when brute force
And evil will are backd with subtlety
Resistance none avails His visage seemd
In length and bulk as doth the pine that tops
Saint Peters Roman fane and th other bones
Of like proportion so that from above
The bank which girdled him below such height
Arose his stature that three Friezelanders
Had strivn in vain to reach but to his hair
Full thirty ample palms was he exposd
Downward from whence a man his garments loops
Raphel bai ameth sabi almi
So shouted his fierce lips which sweeter hymns
Became not and my guide addressd him thus

O senseless spirit let thy horn for thee
Interpret therewith vent thy rage if rage
Or other passion wring thee Search thy neck
There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on
Wild spirit lo upon thy mighty breast
Where hangs the baldrick Then to me he spake
He doth accuse himself Nimrod is this
Through whose ill counsel in the world no more
One tongue prevails But pass we on nor waste
Our words for so each language is to him
As his to others understood by none

Then to the leftward turning sped we forth
And at a slings throw found another shade
Far fiercer and more huge I cannot say
What master hand had girt him but he held
Behind the right arm fetterd and before
The other with a chain that fastend him
From the neck down and five times round his form
Apparent met the wreathed links This proud one
Would of his strength against almighty Jove
Make trial said my guide whence he is thus
Requited Ephialtes him they call

Great was his prowess when the giants brought
Fear on the gods those arms which then he piled
Now moves he never Forthwith I returnd
Fain would I if t were possible mine eyes
Of Briareus immeasurable gaind
Experience next He answerd Thou shalt see
Not far from hence Antaeus who both speaks
And is unfetterd who shall place us there
Where guilt is at its depth Far onward stands
Whom thou wouldst fain behold in chains and made
Like to this spirit save that in his looks
More fell he seems By violent earthquake rockd
Neer shook a towr so reeling to its base
As Ephialtes More than ever then
I dreaded death nor than the terror more
Had needed if I had not seen the cords
That held him fast We straightway journeying on
Came to Antaeus who five ells complete
Without the head forth issued from the cave

O thou who in the fortunate vale that made
Great Scipio heir of glory when his sword
Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight
Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil
An hundred lions and if thou hadst fought
In the high conflict on thy brethrens side
Seems as men yet believd that through thine arm
The sons of earth had conquerd now vouchsafe
To place us down beneath where numbing cold
Locks up Cocytus Force not that we crave
Or Tityus help or Typhons Here is one
Can give what in this realm ye covet Stoop
Therefore nor scornfully distort thy lip
He in the upper world can yet bestow
Renown on thee for he doth live and looks
For life yet longer if before the time
Grace call him not unto herself Thus spake
The teacher He in haste forth stretchd his hands
And caught my guide Alcides whilom felt
That grapple straightend score Soon as my guide
Had felt it he bespake me thus This way
That I may clasp thee then so caught me up
That we were both one burden As appears
The tower of Carisenda from beneath
Where it doth lean if chance a passing cloud
So sail across that opposite it hangs
Such then Antaeus seemd as at mine ease
I markd him stooping I were fain at times
T have passd another way Yet in th abyss
That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs
Lightly he placd us nor there leaning stayd
But rose as in a bark the stately mast




CANTO XXXII

COULD I command rough rhimes and hoarse to suit
That hole of sorrow oer which evry rock
His firm abutment rears then might the vein
Of fancy rise full springing but not mine
Such measures and with faltring awe I touch
The mighty theme for to describe the depth
Of all the universe is no emprize
To jest with and demands a tongue not usd
To infant babbling But let them assist
My song the tuneful maidens by whose aid
Amphion walld in Thebes so with the truth
My speech shall best accord Oh illstarrd folk
Beyond all others wretched who abide
In such a mansion as scarce thought finds words
To speak of better had ye here on earth
Been flocks or mountain goats As down we stood
In the dark pit beneath the giants feet
But lower far than they and I did gaze
Still on the lofty battlement a voice
Bespoke me thus Look how thou walkest Take
Good heed thy soles do tread not on the heads
Of thy poor brethren Thereupon I turnd
And saw before and underneath my feet
A lake whose frozen surface liker seemd
To glass than water Not so thick a veil
In winter eer hath Austrian Danube spread
Oer his still course nor Tanais far remote
Under the chilling sky Rolld oer that mass
Had Tabernich or Pietrapana falln

Not een its rim had creakd As peeps the frog
Croaking above the wave what time in dreams
The village gleaner oft pursues her toil
So to where modest shame appears thus low
Blue pinchd and shrind in ice the spirits stood
Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork
His face each downward held their mouth the cold
Their eyes expressd the dolour of their heart

A space I lookd around then at my feet
Saw two so strictly joind that of their head
The very hairs were mingled Tell me ye
Whose bosoms thus together press said I
Who are ye At that sound their necks they bent
And when their looks were lifted up to me
Straightway their eyes before all moist within
Distilld upon their lips and the frost bound
The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there
Plank unto plank hath never cramp closd up
So stoutly Whence like two enraged goats
They clashd together them such fury seizd

And one from whom the cold both ears had reft
Exclaimd still looking downward Why on us
Dost speculate so long If thou wouldst know
Who are these two the valley whence his wave
Bisenzio slopes did for its master own
Their sire Alberto and next him themselves
They from one body issued and throughout
Caina thou mayst search nor find a shade
More worthy in congealment to be fixd
Not him whose breast and shadow Arthurs land
At that one blow disseverd not Focaccia
No not this spirit whose oerjutting head
Obstructs my onward view he bore the name
Of Mascheroni Tuscan if thou be
Well knowest who he was and to cut short
All further question in my form behold
What once was Camiccione I await
Carlino here my kinsman whose deep guilt
Shall wash out mine A thousand visages
Then markd I which the keen and eager cold
Had shapd into a doggish grin whence creeps
A shivring horror oer me at the thought
Of those frore shallows While we journeyd on
Toward the middle at whose point unites
All heavy substance and I trembling went
Through that eternal chillness I know not
If will it were or destiny or chance
But passing midst the heads my foot did strike
With violent blow against the face of one

Wherefore dost bruise me weeping he exclaimd
Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge
For Montaperto wherefore troublest me

I thus Instructor now await me here
That I through him may rid me of my doubt
Thenceforth what haste thou wilt The teacher pausd
And to that shade I spake who bitterly
Still cursd me in his wrath What art thou speak
That railest thus on others He replied
Now who art thou that smiting others cheeks
Through Antenora roamest with such force
As were past suffrance wert thou living still

And I am living to thy joy perchance
Was my reply if fame be dear to thee
That with the rest I may thy name enrol

The contrary of what I covet most
Said he thou tenderst hence nor vex me more
Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale

Then seizing on his hinder scalp I cried
Name thee or not a hair shall tarry here

Rend all away he answerd yet for that
I will not tell nor show thee who I am
Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times

Now I had graspd his tresses and stript off
More than one tuft he barking with his eyes
Drawn in and downward when another cried
What ails thee Bocca Sound not loud enough
Thy chattring teeth but thou must bark outright
What devil wrings theeNow said I be dumb
Accursed traitor to thy shame of thee
True tidings will I bearOff he replied
Tell what thou list but as thou escape from hence
To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib
Forget not here he wails the Frenchmans gold
Him of Duera thou canst say I markd
Where the starvd sinners pine If thou be askd
What other shade was with them at thy side
Is Beccaria whose red gorge distaind
The biting axe of Florence Farther on
If I misdeem not Soldanieri bides
With Ganellon and Tribaldello him
Who opd Faenza when the people slept

We now had left him passing on our way
When I beheld two spirits by the ice
Pent in one hollow that the head of one
Was cowl unto the other and as bread
Is ravend up through hunger th uppermost
Did so apply his fangs to th others brain
Where the spine joins it Not more furiously
On Menalippus temples Tydeus gnawd
Than on that skull and on its garbage he

O thou who showst so beastly sign of hate
Gainst him thou preyst on let me hear said I
The cause on such condition that if right
Warrant thy grievance knowing who ye are
And what the colour of his sinning was
I may repay thee in the world above
If that wherewith I speak be moist so long




CANTO XXXIII

HIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast
That sinner wipd them on the hairs o th head
Which he behind had mangled then began
Thy will obeying I call up afresh
Sorrow past cure which but to think of wrings
My heart or ere I tell ont But if words
That I may utter shall prove seed to bear
Fruit of eternal infamy to him
The traitor whom I gnaw at thou at once
Shalt see me speak and weep Who thou mayst be
I know not nor how here below art come
But Florentine thou seemest of a truth
When I do hear thee Know I was on earth
Count Ugolino and th Archbishop he
Ruggieri Why I neighbour him so close
Now list That through effect of his ill thoughts
In him my trust reposing I was taen
And after murderd need is not I tell
What therefore thou canst not have heard that is
How cruel was the murder shalt thou hear
And know if he have wrongd me A small grate
Within that mew which for my sake the name
Of famine bears where others yet must pine
Already through its opening sevral moons
Had shown me when I slept the evil sleep
That from the future tore the curtain off
This one methought as master of the sport
Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
Unto the mountain which forbids the sight
Of Lucca to the Pisan With lean brachs
Inquisitive and keen before him rangd
Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi
After short course the father and the sons
Seemd tird and lagging and methought I saw
The sharp tusks gore their sides When I awoke
Before the dawn amid their sleep I heard
My sons for they were with me weep and ask
For bread Right cruel art thou if no pang
Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold
And if not now why use thy tears to flow
Now had they wakend and the hour drew near
When they were wont to bring us food the mind
Of each misgave him through his dream and I
Heard at its outlet underneath lockd up
The horrible tower whence uttering not a word
I lookd upon the visage of my sons
I wept not so all stone I felt within
They wept and one my little Anslem cried
Thou lookest so Father what ails thee Yet
I shed no tear nor answerd all that day
Nor the next night until another sun
Came out upon the world When a faint beam
Had to our doleful prison made its way
And in four countenances I descryd
The image of my own on either hand
Through agony I bit and they who thought
I did it through desire of feeding rose
O th sudden and cried Father we should grieve
Far less if thou wouldst eat of us thou gavst
These weeds of miserable flesh we wear

And do thou strip them off from us again
Then not to make them sadder I kept down
My spirit in stillness That day and the next
We all were silent Ah obdurate earth
Why opendst not upon us When we came
To the fourth day then Geddo at my feet
Outstretchd did fling him crying Hast no help
For me my father There he died and een
Plainly as thou seest me saw I the three
Fall one by one twixt the fifth day and sixth

Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope
Over them all and for three days aloud
Calld on them who were dead Then fasting got
The mastery of grief Thus having spoke

Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
He fastend like a mastiffs gainst the bone
Firm and unyielding Oh thou Pisa shame
Of all the people who their dwelling make
In that fair region where th Italian voice
Is heard since that thy neighbours are so slack
To punish from their deep foundations rise
Capraia and Gorgona and dam up
The mouth of Arno that each soul in thee
May perish in the waters What if fame
Reported that thy castles were betrayd
By Ugolino yet no right hadst thou
To stretch his children on the rack For them
Brigata Ugaccione and the pair
Of gentle ones of whom my song hath told
Their tender years thou modern Thebes did make
Uncapable of guilt Onward we passd
Where others skarfd in rugged folds of ice
Not on their feet were turnd but each reversd

There very weeping suffers not to weep
For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
Impediment and rolling inward turns
For increase of sharp anguish the first tears
Hang clusterd and like crystal vizors show
Under the socket brimming all the cup

Now though the cold had from my face dislodgd
Each feeling as t were callous yet me seemd
Some breath of wind I felt Whence cometh this
Said I my master Is not here below
All vapour quenchdThou shalt be speedily
He answerd where thine eye shall tell thee whence
The cause descrying of this airy shower

Then cried out one in the chill crust who mournd
O souls so cruel that the farthest post
Hath been assignd you from this face remove
The hardend veil that I may vent the grief
Impregnate at my heart some little space
Ere it congeal again I thus replied
Say who thou wast if thou wouldst have mine aid
And if I extricate thee not far down
As to the lowest ice may I descend

The friar Alberigo answered he
Am I who from the evil garden pluckd
Its fruitage and am here repaid the date
More luscious for my figHah I exclaimd
Art thou too deadHow in the world aloft
It fareth with my body answerd he
I am right ignorant Such privilege
Hath Ptolomea that ofttimes the soul
Drops hither ere by Atropos divorcd
And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
The glazed teardrops that oerlay mine eyes
Know that the soul that moment she betrays
As I did yields her body to a fiend
Who after moves and governs it at will
Till all its time be rounded headlong she
Falls to this cistern And perchance above
Doth yet appear the body of a ghost
Who here behind me winters Him thou knowst
If thou but newly art arrivd below
The years are many that have passd away
Since to this fastness Branca Doria came

Now answerd I methinks thou mockest me
For Branca Doria never yet hath died
But doth all natural functions of a man
Eats drinks and sleeps and putteth raiment on

He thus Not yet unto that upper foss
By th evil talons guarded where the pitch
Tenacious boils had Michael Zanche reachd
When this one left a demon in his stead
In his own body and of one his kin
Who with him treachery wrought But now put forth
Thy hand and ope mine eyes I opd them not
Ill manners were best courtesy to him

Ah Genoese men perverse in every way
With every foulness staind why from the earth
Are ye not canceld Such an one of yours
I with Romagnas darkest spirit found
As for his doings even now in soul
Is in Cocytus plungd and yet doth seem
In body still alive upon the earth




CANTO XXXIV

THE banners of Hells Monarch do come forth
Towards us therefore look so spake my guide
If thou discern him As when breathes a cloud
Heavy and dense or when the shades of night
Fall on our hemisphere seems viewd from far
A windmill which the blast stirs briskly round
Such was the fabric then methought I saw

To shield me from the wind forthwith I drew
Behind my guide no covert else was there

Now came I and with fear I bid my strain
Record the marvel where the souls were all
Whelmd underneath transparent as through glass
Pellucid the frail stem Some prone were laid
Others stood upright this upon the soles
That on his head a third with face to feet
Archd like a bow When to the point we came
Whereat my guide was pleasd that I should see
The creature eminent in beauty once
He from before me steppd and made me pause

Lo he exclaimd lo Dis and lo the place
Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength

How frozen and how faint I then became
Ask me not reader for I write it not
Since words would fail to tell thee of my state
I was not dead nor living Think thyself
If quick conception work in thee at all
How I did feel That emperor who sways
The realm of sorrow at mid breast from th ice
Stood forth and I in stature am more like
A giant than the giants are in his arms
Mark now how great that whole must be which suits
With such a part If he were beautiful
As he is hideous now and yet did dare
To scowl upon his Maker well from him
May all our misry flow Oh what a sight
How passing strange it seemd when I did spy
Upon his head three faces one in front
Of hue vermilion th other two with this
Midway each shoulder joind and at the crest
The right twixt wan and yellow seemd the left
To look on such as come from whence old Nile
Stoops to the lowlands Under each shot forth
Two mighty wings enormous as became
A bird so vast Sails never such I saw
Outstretchd on the wide sea No plumes had they
But were in texture like a bat and these
He flappd i th air that from him issued still
Three winds wherewith Cocytus to its depth
Was frozen At six eyes he wept the tears
Adown three chins distilld with bloody foam
At every mouth his teeth a sinner champd
Bruisd as with pondrous engine so that three
Were in this guise tormented But far more
Than from that gnawing was the foremost pangd
By the fierce rending whence ofttimes the back
Was stript of all its skin That upper spirit
Who hath worse punishment so spake my guide
Is Judas he that hath his head within
And plies the feet without Of th other two
Whose heads are under from the murky jaw
Who hangs is Brutus lo how he doth writhe
And speaks not Th other Cassius that appears
So large of limb But night now reascends
And it is time for parting All is seen

I clippd him round the neck for so he bade
And noting time and place he when the wings
Enough were opd caught fast the shaggy sides
And down from pile to pile descending steppd
Between the thick fell and the jagged ice

Soon as he reachd the point whereat the thigh
Upon the swelling of the haunches turns
My leader there with pain and struggling hard
Turnd round his head where his feet stood before
And grappled at the fell as one who mounts
That into hell methought we turnd again

Expect that by such stairs as these thus spake
The teacher panting like a man forespent
We must depart from evil so extreme
Then at a rocky opening issued forth
And placd me on a brink to sit next joind
With wary step my side I raisd mine eyes
Believing that I Lucifer should see
Where he was lately left but saw him now
With legs held upward Let the grosser sort
Who see not what the point was I had passd
Bethink them if sore toil oppressd me then

Arise my master cried upon thy feet
The way is long and much uncouth the road
And now within one hour and half of noon
The sun returns It was no palacehall
Lofty and luminous wherein we stood
But natural dungeon where ill footing was
And scant supply of light Ere from th abyss
I seprate thus when risen I began
My guide vouchsafe few words to set me free
From errors thralldom Where is now the ice
How standeth he in posture thus reversd
And how from eve to morn in space so brief
Hath the sun made his transit He in few
Thus answering spake Thou deemest thou art still
On th other side the centre where I graspd
Th abhorred worm that boreth through the world
Thou wast on th other side so long as I
Descended when I turnd thou didst oerpass
That point to which from evry part is draggd
All heavy substance Thou art now arrivd
Under the hemisphere opposed to that
Which the great continent doth overspread
And underneath whose canopy expird
The Man that was born sinless and so livd
Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere
Whose other aspect is Judecca Morn
Here rises when there evening sets and he
Whose shaggy pile was scald yet standeth fixd
As at the first On this part he fell down
From heavn and th earth here prominent before
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea
And to our hemisphere retird Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears
That sprang aloof There is a place beneath
From Belzebub as distant as extends
The vaulted tomb discoverd not by sight
But by the sound of brooklet that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock
Which as it winds with no precipitous course
The wave hath eaten By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter to return
To the fair world and heedless of repose
We climbed he first I following his steps
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heavn
Dawnd through a circular opening in the cave
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars
